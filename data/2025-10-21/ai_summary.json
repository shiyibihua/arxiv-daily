Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However,\nprevious attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in\nisolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce\nGrasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding.\nEmpowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports\n(1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2)\nmodeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally\nachieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form\nquestions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to\nactive dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a\nmore accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more\nimportantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple\nregions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains\nthe state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5\non DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple\nprompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B\non GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms\nin-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong\ncapabilities can be easily transferred to videos.",

Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless\ninteractions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and\nutilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce\nsubstantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new\nmemory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance\nand efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of\nhuman memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First,\ncognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information\nthrough lightweight compression and groups information according to their\ntopics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based\ngroups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally,\nlong-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that\ndecouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with\nGPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in\naccuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API\ncalls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x.

However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different\nnoise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although\nthis randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider\nperceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR\nperformance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference\nOptimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative\nmodels with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations.\nWe construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and\nno-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human\npreference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and\nnatural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the\nstandard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from\noutputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection\nratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage,\nwhile larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision.\nFurthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively\nweights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group\ndiversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments\nacross both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR\nsignificantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world\nbenchmarks.",

This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by\ncapturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks.\nTheoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of\ncorrect classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and\nlabel consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective\nattention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a\nhigh level of label consistency.

Due to the varying granularity of target states across\ndifferent tasks, most existing trackers are tailored to a single task and\nheavily rely on custom-designed modules within the individual task, which\nlimits their generalization and leads to redundancy in both model design and\nparameters. To unify video tracking tasks, we present SAM 2++, a unified model\ntowards tracking at any granularity, including masks, boxes, and points. First,\nto extend target granularity, we design task-specific prompts to encode various\ntask inputs into general prompt embeddings, and a unified decoder to unify\ndiverse task results into a unified form pre-output. Next, to satisfy memory\nmatching, the core operation of tracking, we introduce a task-adaptive memory\nmechanism that unifies memory across different granularities. Finally, we\nintroduce a customized data engine to support tracking training at any\ngranularity, producing a large and diverse video tracking dataset with rich\nannotations at three granularities, termed Tracking-Any-Granularity, which\nrepresents a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking on unified\ntracking. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm that SAM 2++\nsets a new state of the art across diverse tracking tasks at different\ngranularities, establishing a unified and robust tracking framework.",

In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks\nsupport for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict\nits applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have\nattempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to\nenhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and\nfine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces\nof LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently\nwithout alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can\ndisrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder,\nleading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training.\nTo address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based\nprogressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP\nimage encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills\nknowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage\nCLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between\nthe LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns\nthe CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text\ncontrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid\noverfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment\nloss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation\ninheritance and contrastive tuning.

Building upon this paradigm, we focus on the integration of\nspectral and spatial cues and introduce a novel \"Rebellious Student\" framework\nfor complementary feature learning. Unlike conventional teacher-student\nparadigms driven by imitation, our method intentionally trains the spatial\nbranch to diverge from the spectral teacher, thereby learning complementary\nspatial patterns that the teacher fails to capture. A two-stage learning\nstrategy is adopted: (1) a spectral enhancement network is first trained via\nreverse distillation to obtain robust background spectral representations; and\n(2) a spatial network -- the rebellious student -- is subsequently optimized\nusing decorrelation losses that enforce feature orthogonality while maintaining\nreconstruction fidelity to avoid irrelevant noise. Once trained, the framework\nenhances both spectral and spatial background features, enabling parameter-free\nand training-free anomaly detection when paired with conventional detectors.\nExtensive experiments on the HAD100 benchmark show substantial improvements\nover several established baselines with minimal computational overhead,\nconfirming the effectiveness and generality of the proposed complementary\nlearning paradigm.

However, the vanilla 3DGS assumes static\nillumination and that observed appearance depends solely on viewing angle,\nwhich causes incompatibility with the photometric variations in colonoscopic\nscenes induced by dynamic light source/camera. This mismatch forces most 3DGS\nmethods to introduce structure-violating vaporous Gaussian blobs between the\ncamera and tissues to compensate for illumination attenuation, ultimately\ndegrading the quality of 3D reconstructions. Previous works only consider the\nillumination attenuation caused by light distance, ignoring the physical\ncharacters of light source and camera. In this paper, we propose ColIAGS, an\nimproved 3DGS framework tailored for colonoscopy. To mimic realistic appearance\nunder varying illumination, we introduce an Improved Appearance Modeling with\ntwo types of illumination attenuation factors, which enables Gaussians to adapt\nto photometric variations while preserving geometry accuracy. To ensure the\ngeometry approximation condition of appearance modeling, we propose an Improved\nGeometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance Gaussian\ngeometry attribute prediction. Furthermore, another cosine embedding input is\nleveraged to generate illumination attenuation solutions in an implicit manner.\nComprehensive experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our\nproposed ColIAGS achieves the dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and\naccurate geometric reconstruction. It notably outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art methods by achieving superior rendering fidelity while\nsignificantly reducing Depth MSE. Code will be available.",

However, their ability to handle complex, real-world web\ndocuments remains limited, particularly in scenarios where text and images are\ninterleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Vision-Centric Contrastive Learning (VC2L), a unified\nframework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single\nvision transformer. VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all\ninputs, whether textual, visual, or combined, as images, thus eliminating the\nneed for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategy. To capture\ncomplex cross-modal relationships in multimodal web documents, VC2L employs a\nsnippet-level contrastive learning objective that aligns consecutive multimodal\nsegments, leveraging the inherent coherence of documents without requiring\nexplicitly paired image-text data. To assess the effectiveness of this\napproach, we introduce three retrieval benchmarks, AnyCIR, SeqCIR, and CSR,\ndesigned to evaluate cross-modal retrieval, fine-grained sequential\nunderstanding, and generalization to unseen data, respectively. Empirical\nresults show that VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to\nCLIP-style models on both the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such\nas M-BEIR and MTEB. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal web\ndata as a valuable training resource for contrastive learning and illustrate\nthe scalability of a unified, vision-centric approach for multimodal\nrepresentation learning.

Leveraging\nthe general world knowledge and fine-grained image understanding capabilities\nof a closed-source Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), i.e.,\nGemini-2.5-Pro, an effective pipeline is developed for reliable benchmark\nconstruction and streamlined model assessment. Moreover, to further facilitate\ncommunity use, we train a robust evaluation model that enables offline\nassessment of T2I model outputs. Through comprehensive benchmarking of both\nopen- and closed-sourced T2I models, we systematically reveal their strengths\nand weaknesses across various aspects.",

Traditional HWI methods typically rely on handcrafted image processing\nand clustering techniques, which tend to perform well on small and carefully\ncurated datasets.

We explore different\ncombinations of pre-processing methods, backbone architectures, and\npost-processing strategies, including text segmentation, patch sampling, and\nfeature aggregation.

            "summary": "Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years,\nparticularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model\nreduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely\nused technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights,\nneurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is\nespecially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which\nfurther accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can\nbe computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.\nTo overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which\napplies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a\nconsiderable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by\nproposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep\nlearning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages\ncause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a\nprogressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the\nnetwork, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of\nthe model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network\nand vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we\ndemonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in\nmodel size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for\nfine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the\nbest trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.",

However, their limited representational\ncapacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial\nimagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that\ncan effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images\nwhile reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D\nmentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on\nexplicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of\ntwo stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent\ngenerated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g.,\nVGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on\noutcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive\nexperiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently\noutperforms strong baselines and offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D\nrepresentations into multimodal reasoning.

To address this gap, we present CUARewardBench,\ncomprising four key contributions: (1) First-ever Comprehensive CUA Reward\nBenchmark: We introduce the first benchmark for evaluating both outcome reward\nmodels (ORM) and process reward models (PRM) on CUA tasks, enabling systematic\nassessment across trajectory-level and step-level evaluation. (2) Diverse,\nPractical and Reliable Dataset: CUARewardBench encompasses trajectories from 10\nsoftware categories and 7 agent architectures with varying performance levels\n(25.9%-50.8% success rates). All trajectories are expertly annotated through\ncarefully designed protocols, with rigorous quality control to ensure\nreliability and practical applicability. (3) Comprehensive Analysis and\nInsights: Through extensive experiments across 7 vision-language models and 3\nprompt templates, we reveal critical limitations of current CUA RMs, including\ninsufficient visual reasoning capabilities, knowledge deficiencies, and the\nsuperiority of general VLMs over specialized CUA models for reward evaluation.\n(4) Unanimous Prompt Ensemble (UPE): Based on the insights from our\ncomprehensive analysis, we propose UPE, a novel ensemble method that\nsignificantly enhances reward model reliability through strict unanimous voting\nand strategic prompt-template configurations.

For the\ncamera modality, we release both the full and mini versions with four types of\nocclusions, two adapted from public implementations and two newly designed. For\nradar and LiDAR, we provide parameterised occlusion scripts that implement\nthree types of degradations each, enabling flexible and repeatable generation\nof occluded data. This resource supports consistent, reproducible evaluation of\nperception models under partial sensor failures and environmental interference.\nBy releasing the first multi-sensor occlusion dataset with controlled and\nreproducible degradations, we aim to advance research on robust sensor fusion,\nresilience analysis, and safety-critical perception in automated driving.",

Embodied agents\nequipped with large language models (LLMs) and online constructed navigation\nmaps can perform ObjNav in a zero-shot manner. However, existing agents heavily\nrely on giant LLMs on the cloud, e.g., GPT-4, while directly switching to small\nLLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-11b, suffer from significant success rate drops due to\nlimited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which\nprevents deploying ObjNav on local devices. At the same time, the long prompt\nintroduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency\non local devices. In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device\nefficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav. To help the smaller LLMs better\nunderstand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to\nprune redundant information in navigation maps. To reduce planning latency, we\npropose discrete memory caching and attention-based memory clustering to\nefficiently save and re-use the KV cache. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that EfficientNav achieves 11.1% improvement in success rate on\nHM3D benchmark over GPT-4-based baselines, and demonstrates 6.7x real-time\nlatency reduction and 4.7x end-to-end latency reduction over GPT-4 planner.

Previous efforts navigate this\nchallenge primarily through image-level modeling or annotation-based\noptimization. Despite advancing considerably, this commonplace practice hardly\ntaps valuable dataset-level contextual information or relies on laborious\nannotations. In this paper, we propose RISE, a RetrIeval SElf-augmented\nparadigm that exploits the entire training dataset to generate pseudo-labels\nfor single images, which could be used to train COD models. RISE begins by\nconstructing prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using\ntraining images (without ground truth), followed by K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)\nretrieval to generate pseudo-masks for each image based on these libraries. It\nis important to recognize that using only training images without annotations\nexerts a pronounced challenge in crafting high-quality prototype libraries. In\nthis light, we introduce a Clustering-then-Retrieval (CR) strategy, where\ncoarse masks are first generated through clustering, facilitating subsequent\nhistogram-based image filtering and cross-category retrieval to produce\nhigh-confidence prototypes. In the KNN retrieval stage, to alleviate the effect\nof artifacts in feature maps, we propose Multi-View KNN Retrieval (MVKR), which\nintegrates retrieval results from diverse views to produce more robust and\nprecise pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE outperforms\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised and prompt-based methods. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/xiaohainku/RISE.",

Unlike\nconventional training from scratch, ScaleNet facilitates rapid model expansion\nwith negligible increases in parameters, building on existing pretrained\nmodels. This offers a cost-effective solution for scaling up ViTs.\nSpecifically, ScaleNet achieves model expansion by inserting additional layers\ninto pretrained ViTs, utilizing layer-wise weight sharing to maintain\nparameters efficiency.

To mitigate potential\nperformance degradation due to shared weights, ScaleNet introduces a small set\nof adjustment parameters for each layer. These adjustment parameters are\nimplemented through parallel adapter modules, ensuring that each instance of\nthe shared parameter tensor remains distinct and optimized for its specific\nfunction. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that ScaleNet\nenables efficient expansion of ViT models. With a 2$\\times$ depth-scaled\nDeiT-Base model, ScaleNet achieves a 7.42% accuracy improvement over training\nfrom scratch while requiring only one-third of the training epochs,\nhighlighting its efficiency in scaling ViTs.

The objective of this study is to\nintroduce and validate a novel local surface representation method for the\nautomated and accurate diagnosis of AD. Methods: The study utilizes T1-weighted\nMRI scans from 160 participants (80 AD patients and 80 healthy controls) from\nthe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cortical surface models\nwere reconstructed from the MRI data using Freesurfer. Key geometric attributes\nwere computed from the 3D meshes. Area distortion and conformal factor were\nderived using Ricci flow for conformal parameterization, while Gaussian\ncurvature was calculated directly from the mesh geometry. Shannon entropy was\napplied to these three features to create compact and informative feature\nvectors. The feature vectors were used to train and evaluate a suite of\nclassifiers (e.g. XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.). Results:\nStatistical significance of performance differences between classifiers was\nevaluated using paired Welch's t-test. The method proved highly effective in\ndistinguishing AD patients from healthy controls.

To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by\nassigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with\nthe highest scores.

            "summary": "Image complexity assessment (ICA) is a challenging task in perceptual\nevaluation due to the subjective nature of human perception and the inherent\nsemantic diversity in real-world images. Existing ICA methods predominantly\nrely on hand-crafted or shallow convolutional neural network-based features of\na single visual modality, which are insufficient to fully capture the perceived\nrepresentations closely related to image complexity. Recently, cross-modal\nscene semantic information has been shown to play a crucial role in various\ncomputer vision tasks, particularly those involving perceptual understanding.\nHowever, the exploration of cross-modal scene semantic information in the\ncontext of ICA remains unaddressed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel ICA method called Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment (CM-SSA), which\nleverages scene semantic alignment from a cross-modal perspective to enhance\nICA performance, enabling complexity predictions to be more consistent with\nsubjective human perception. Specifically, the proposed CM-SSA consists of a\ncomplexity regression branch and a scene semantic alignment branch. The\ncomplexity regression branch estimates image complexity levels under the\nguidance of the scene semantic alignment branch, while the scene semantic\nalignment branch is used to align images with corresponding text prompts that\nconvey rich scene semantic information by pair-wise learning. Extensive\nexperiments on several ICA datasets demonstrate that the proposed CM-SSA\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

To address this challenge, we propose\nMMRHP, a miniature mixed-reality HIL platform that elevates miniaturized\ntesting from functional demonstration to rigorous, reproducible quantitative\nanalysis. The core contributions are threefold. First, we propose a systematic\nthree-phase testing process oriented toward the Safety of the Intended\nFunctionality(SOTIF)standard, providing actionable guidance for identifying the\nperformance limits and triggering conditions of otherwise correctly functioning\nsystems. Second, we design and implement a HIL platform centered around a\nunified spatiotemporal measurement core to support this process, ensuring\nconsistent and traceable quantification of physical motion and system timing.\nFinally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this solution through\ncomprehensive experiments. The platform itself was first validated, achieving a\nspatial accuracy of 10.27 mm RMSE and a stable closed-loop latency baseline of\napproximately 45 ms. Subsequently, an in-depth Autoware case study leveraged\nthis validated platform to quantify its performance baseline and identify a\ncritical performance cliff at an injected latency of 40 ms.

Achieving high-quality reconstruction requires capturing images of\nkeypoints within the target scene from diverse viewing angles, and coverage\ncontrol offers an effective framework to meet this requirement. Meanwhile,\nrecent advances in real-time 3D reconstruction algorithms make it possible to\nrender an evolving map during flight, enabling immediate feedback to guide\ndrone motion. Building on this, we present Coverage-Recon, a novel coordinated\nimage sampling algorithm that integrates online map feedback to improve\nreconstruction quality on-the-fly. In Coverage-Recon, the coordinated motion of\ndrones is governed by a Quadratic Programming (QP)-based angle-aware coverage\ncontroller, which ensures multi-viewpoint image capture while enforcing safety\nconstraints. The captured images are processed in real time by the NeuralRecon\nalgorithm to generate an evolving 3D mesh. Mesh changes across the scene are\ninterpreted as indicators of reconstruction uncertainty and serve as feedback\nto update the importance index of the coverage control as the map evolves. The\neffectiveness of Coverage-Recon is validated through simulation and\nexperiments, demonstrating both qualitatively and quantitatively that\nincorporating online map feedback yields more complete and accurate 3D\nreconstructions than conventional methods.

However, existing methods lack sufficient\nflexibility and dynamic adaptability in temporal sampling and modality\npreference awareness, making it difficult to focus on key information based on\nthe question. This limits their reasoning capability in complex scenarios. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel framework named AV-Master. It\nenhances the model's ability to extract key information from complex\naudio-visual scenes with substantial redundant content by dynamically modeling\nboth temporal and modality dimensions. In the temporal dimension, we introduce\na dynamic adaptive focus sampling mechanism that progressively focuses on\naudio-visual segments most relevant to the question, effectively mitigating\nredundancy and segment fragmentation in traditional sampling methods. In the\nmodality dimension, we propose a preference-aware strategy that models each\nmodality's contribution independently, enabling selective activation of\ncritical features. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-path contrastive loss to\nreinforce consistency and complementarity across temporal and modality\ndimensions, guiding the model to learn question-specific cross-modal\ncollaborative representations. Experiments on four large-scale benchmarks show\nthat AV-Master significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in\ncomplex reasoning tasks.",

Few-Shot Learning (FSL) provides a promising approach to data\nscarcity, yet current FSL research mainly relies on generic benchmark datasets\nlacking remote-sensing disaster imagery, limiting its practical effectiveness.\nMoreover, disaster images exhibit high intra-class variation and inter-class\nsimilarity, hindering the performance of conventional metric-based FSL methods.\nTo address these issues, this paper introduces the Attention-based\nBhattacharyya-Hellinger Feature Aggregation Network (ATTBHFA-Net), which\nlinearly combines the Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distances to\ncompare and aggregate feature probability distributions for robust prototype\nformation. The Bhattacharyya coefficient serves as a contrastive margin that\nenhances inter-class separability, while the Hellinger distance regularizes\nsame-class alignment. This framework parallels contrastive learning but\noperates over probability distributions rather than embedded feature points.\nFurthermore, a Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distance-based contrastive loss is\nproposed as a distributional counterpart to cosine similarity loss, used\njointly with categorical cross-entropy to significantly improve FSL\nperformance.

However, existing medical MLLMs rely\nsolely on internal knowledge during reasoning, leading to hallucinated\nreasoning and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their\ntraining scope. Although recent Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nmethods elicit the medical model's proactive retrieval ability during\nreasoning, they are confined to unimodal LLMs, neglecting the crucial visual\ninformation during reasoning and retrieval. Consequently, we propose the first\nMultimodal Medical Reasoning-with-Retrieval framework, Med-RwR, which actively\nretrieves external knowledge by querying observed symptoms or domain-specific\nmedical concepts during reasoning. Specifically, we design a two-stage\nreinforcement learning strategy with tailored rewards that stimulate the model\nto leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information\nfor effective retrieval. Building on this foundation, we further propose a\nConfidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) method for test-time scaling when\nlow prediction confidence is detected. Evaluation on various public medical\nbenchmarks demonstrates Med-RwR's significant improvements over baseline\nmodels, proving the effectiveness of enhancing reasoning capabilities with\nexternal knowledge integration. Furthermore, Med-RwR demonstrates remarkable\ngeneralizability to unfamiliar domains, evidenced by 8.8% performance gain on\nour proposed EchoCardiography Benchmark (ECBench), despite the scarcity of\nechocardiography data in the training corpus.

However, traditional federated\nlearning methods fail to account for the imbalance in information aggregation\nacross clients in cross-domain scenarios, leading to the Global Drift (GD)\nproblem and a consequent decline in model generalization performance. This\nmotivates us to delve deeper and define a new critical issue: global drift in\nfederated domain generalization for medical imaging (FedDG-GD). In this paper,\nwe propose a novel tree topology framework called TreeFedDG. First, starting\nfrom the distributed characteristics of medical images, we design a\nhierarchical parameter aggregation method based on a tree-structured topology\nto suppress deviations in the global model direction. Second, we introduce a\nparameter difference-based style mixing method (FedStyle), which enforces\nmixing among clients with maximum parameter differences to enhance robustness\nagainst drift. Third, we develop a a progressive personalized fusion strategy\nduring model distribution, ensuring a balance between knowledge transfer and\npersonalized features. Finally, during the inference phase, we use feature\nsimilarity to guide the retrieval of the most relevant model chain from the\ntree structure for ensemble decision-making, thereby fully leveraging the\nadvantages of hierarchical knowledge.

But existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods\nusually learn mesh features in Euclidean space. It's hard to catch this\nhierarchical structure accurately. So wrong human meshes are reconstructed. To\nsolve this problem, we propose a hyperbolic space learning method leveraging\ntemporal motion prior for recovering 3D human meshes from videos. First, we\ndesign a temporal motion prior extraction module. This module extracts the\ntemporal motion features from the input 3D pose sequences and image feature\nsequences respectively. Then it combines them into the temporal motion prior.\nIn this way, it can strengthen the ability to express features in the temporal\nmotion dimension. Since data representation in non-Euclidean space has been\nproved to effectively capture hierarchical relationships in real-world datasets\n(especially in hyperbolic space), we further design a hyperbolic space\noptimization learning strategy. This strategy uses the temporal motion prior\ninformation to assist learning, and uses 3D pose and pose motion information\nrespectively in the hyperbolic space to optimize and learn the mesh features.\nThen, we combine the optimized results to get an accurate and smooth human\nmesh. Besides, to make the optimization learning process of human meshes in\nhyperbolic space stable and effective, we propose a hyperbolic mesh\noptimization loss. Extensive experimental results on large publicly available\ndatasets indicate superiority in comparison with most state-of-the-art.",

This paper presents\n\\emph{FST.ai 2.0}, an explainable AI ecosystem designed to support referees,\ncoaches, and athletes in real time during Taekwondo competitions and training.\nThe system integrates {pose-based action recognition} using graph convolutional\nnetworks (GCNs), {epistemic uncertainty modeling} through credal sets, and\n{explainability overlays} for visual decision support. A set of {interactive\ndashboards} enables human--AI collaboration in referee evaluation, athlete\nperformance analysis, and Para-Taekwondo classification. Beyond automated\nscoring, FST.ai~2.0 incorporates modules for referee training, fairness\nmonitoring, and policy-level analytics within the World Taekwondo ecosystem.\nExperimental validation on competition data demonstrates an {85\\% reduction in\ndecision review time} and {93\\% referee trust} in AI-assisted decisions. The\nframework thus establishes a transparent and extensible pipeline for\ntrustworthy, data-driven officiating and athlete assessment. By bridging\nreal-time perception, explainable inference, and governance-aware design,\nFST.ai~2.0 represents a step toward equitable, accountable, and human-aligned\nAI in sports.",

            "summary": "Global illumination (GI) is essential for realistic rendering but remains\ncomputationally expensive due to the complexity of simulating indirect light\ntransport. Recent neural methods have mainly relied on per-scene optimization,\nsometimes extended to handle changes in camera or geometry. Efforts toward\ncross-scene generalization have largely stayed in 2D screen space, such as\nneural denoising or G-buffer based GI prediction, which often suffer from view\ninconsistency and limited spatial understanding. We propose a generalizable 3D\nlight transport embedding that approximates global illumination directly from\n3D scene configurations, without using rasterized or path-traced cues. Each\nscene is represented as a point cloud with geometric and material features. A\nscalable transformer models global point-to-point interactions to encode these\nfeatures into neural primitives. At render time, each query point retrieves\nnearby primitives via nearest-neighbor search and aggregates their latent\nfeatures through cross-attention to predict the desired rendering quantity. We\ndemonstrate results on diffuse global illumination prediction across diverse\nindoor scenes with varying layouts, geometry, and materials. The embedding\ntrained for irradiance estimation can be quickly adapted to new rendering tasks\nwith limited fine-tuning. We also present preliminary results for\nspatial-directional radiance field estimation for glossy materials and show how\nthe normalized field can accelerate unbiased path guiding. This approach\nhighlights a path toward integrating learned priors into rendering pipelines\nwithout explicit ray-traced illumination cues.",

To alleviate this\nlimitation, we first introduce RadDiagSeg-D, a dataset combining abnormality\ndetection, diagnosis, and multi-target segmentation into a unified and\nhierarchical task.

Finally, we benchmark RadDiagSeg-M and showcase its strong\nperformance across all components involved in the task of multi-target\ntext-and-mask generation, establishing a robust and competitive baseline.",
