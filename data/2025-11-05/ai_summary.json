            "summary": "Effective explanations of video action recognition models should disentangle\nhow movements unfold over time from the surrounding spatial context. However,\nexisting methods based on saliency produce entangled explanations, making it\nunclear whether predictions rely on motion or spatial context. Language-based\napproaches offer structure but often fail to explain motions due to their tacit\nnature -- intuitively understood but difficult to verbalize. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Disentangled Action aNd Context concept-based\nExplainable (DANCE) video action recognition, a framework that predicts actions\nthrough disentangled concept types: motion dynamics, objects, and scenes. We\ndefine motion dynamics concepts as human pose sequences. We employ a large\nlanguage model to automatically extract object and scene concepts. Built on an\nante-hoc concept bottleneck design, DANCE enforces prediction through these\nconcepts. Experiments on four datasets -- KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101\n-- demonstrate that DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with\ncompetitive performance. We validate the superior interpretability of DANCE\nthrough a user study. Experimental results also show that DANCE is beneficial\nfor model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.",

This work introduces a\nself-contained soft gripper with fixed size that operates solely through\ninternal liquid redistribution among three interconnected bistable snap-through\nchambers. When the top sensing chamber deforms upon contact, the displaced\nliquid triggers snap-through expansion of the grasping chambers, enabling\nstable and size-selective grasping without continuous energy input. The\ninternal hydraulic feedback further allows passive adaptation of gripping\npressure to object stiffness. This source-free and compact design opens new\npossibilities for lightweight, stiffness-adaptive fluid-driven manipulation in\nsoft robotics, providing a feasible approach for targeted size-specific\nsampling and operation in underwater and field environments.",

However, existing methods for social\ninteraction detection overlook such nuanced cues and primarily rely on holistic\nrepresentations of individuals. Moreover, they directly detect social groups\nwithout explicitly modeling the underlying interactions between individuals.\nThese drawbacks limit their ability to capture localized social signals and\nintroduce ambiguity when group configurations should be inferred from social\ninteractions grounded in nuanced cues. In this work, we propose a part-aware\nbottom-up group reasoning framework for fine-grained social interaction\ndetection. The proposed method infers social groups and their interactions\nusing body part features and their interpersonal relations. Our model first\ndetects individuals and enhances their features using part-aware cues, and then\ninfers group configuration by associating individuals via similarity-based\nreasoning, which considers not only spatial relations but also subtle social\ncues that signal interactions, leading to more accurate group inference.\nExperiments on the NVI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms prior\nmethods, achieving the new state of the art.",

Many real-world scenarios require robots to\nnavigate dynamic environments while adhering to manifold constraints imposed by\ntasks. For example, service robots must carry cups upright while avoiding\ncollisions with humans or other robots. Despite recent advances in\ndecentralized MAMP for high-dimensional systems, incorporating manifold\nconstraints remains difficult. To address this, we propose a\nmanifold-constrained Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) learning framework for\ndecentralized MAMP. Our method solves HJR problems under manifold constraints\nto capture task-aware safety conditions, which are then integrated into a\ndecentralized trajectory optimization planner. This enables robots to generate\nmotion plans that are both safe and task-feasible without requiring assumptions\nabout other agents' policies. Our approach generalizes across diverse\nmanifold-constrained tasks and scales effectively to high-dimensional\nmulti-agent manipulation problems. Experiments show that our method outperforms\nexisting constrained motion planners and operates at speeds suitable for\nreal-world applications.

We introduce Anny, a simple, fully\ndifferentiable, and scan-free human body model grounded in anthropometric\nknowledge from the MakeHuman community. Anny defines a continuous,\ninterpretable shape space, where phenotype parameters (e.g. gender, age,\nheight, weight) control blendshapes spanning a wide range of human forms --\nacross ages (from infants to elders), body types, and proportions. Calibrated\nusing WHO population statistics, it provides realistic and demographically\ngrounded human shape variation within a single unified model. Thanks to its\nopenness and semantic control, Anny serves as a versatile foundation for 3D\nhuman modeling -- supporting millimeter-accurate scan fitting, controlled\nsynthetic data generation, and Human Mesh Recovery (HMR). We further introduce\nAnny-One, a collection of 800k photorealistic humans generated with Anny,\nshowing that despite its simplicity, HMR models trained with Anny can match the\nperformance of those trained with scan-based body models, while remaining\ninterpretable and broadly representative. The Anny body model and its code are\nreleased under the Apache 2.0 license, making Anny an accessible foundation for\nhuman-centric 3D modeling.",

To address this, we propose the Multi-User Preferences\nQuantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (MUP-QBAF), a novel multi-user\npersonalisation framework based on Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation\nFrameworks (QBAFs) that explicitly models and resolves multi-user preference\nconflicts. Unlike prior work in Argumentation Frameworks, which typically\nassumes static inputs, our approach is tailored to robotics: it incorporates\nboth users' arguments and the robot's dynamic observations of the environment,\nallowing the system to adapt over time and respond to changing contexts.\nPreferences, both positive and negative, are represented as arguments whose\nstrength is recalculated iteratively based on new information. The framework's\nproperties and capabilities are presented and validated through a realistic\ncase study, where an assistive robot mediates between the conflicting\npreferences of a caregiver and a care recipient during a frailty assessment\ntask. This evaluation further includes a sensitivity analysis of argument base\nscores, demonstrating how preference outcomes can be shaped by user input and\ncontextual observations. By offering a transparent, structured, and\ncontext-sensitive approach to resolving competing user preferences, this work\nadvances the field of multi-user HRI. It provides a principled alternative to\ndata-driven methods, enabling robots to navigate conflicts in real-world\nenvironments.",

The issue is more severe when robots do not have a\nchance to scan the scene to update their world model while focusing on assigned\ntasks. To help align humans' mental models of robots' vision capabilities, we\npropose four FoV indicators in augmented reality (AR) and conducted a user\nhuman-subjects experiment (N=41) to evaluate them in terms of accuracy,\nconfidence, task efficiency, and workload.

The egocentric indicator\nof deeper eye sockets, possible for physical alteration, also increased\naccuracy. In all indicators, participants' confidence was high while cognitive\nload remained low.

However, the literature at the intersection of\nthese verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper\nintroduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for\nanalyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through\nLLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain\nknowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting\nnatively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time\nseries data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2\nCLI tools (\"ros2 bag list\" or \"ros2 bag info\"), as well as the ability to\nfilter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP\nserver, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling\nwith different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source\n(through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling\ncapabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both\nproprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that\nthere is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude\nSonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that\nthere are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool\ndescription schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools\navailable to the models.

At\nits core is a speech information bottleneck (SIB) module, which compresses raw\nspeech into compact semantic tokens, preserving prosody and emotional nuance.\nBy operating directly on these tokens, VoxStudio eliminates the need for an\nadditional speech-to-text system, which often ignores the hidden details beyond\ntext, e.g., tone or emotion. We also release VoxEmoset, a large-scale paired\nemotional speech-image dataset built via an advanced TTS engine to affordably\ngenerate richly expressive utterances.

Methods such as CoOp and\nCoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors,\nknown as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these\nmodels often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While\ntraditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data\naugmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based\nmodifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely\nunexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations,\nparticularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support\nand enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between\nthese augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to\nimprove generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such\nas CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that\nfocus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose\nAdding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces\nadversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations\nintroduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This\ndecoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually\ndiscriminative features that align with the target categories.

We revisit diffusion-based Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) for these models and identify a critical\npathology: enlarging the preference margin does not necessarily improve\ngeneration quality. In particular, the standard Diffusion-DPO objective can\nincrease the reconstruction error of both winner and loser branches.\nConsequently, degradation of the less-preferred outputs can become sufficiently\nsevere that the preferred branch is also adversely affected even as the margin\ngrows. To address this, we introduce Diffusion-SDPO, a safeguarded update rule\nthat preserves the winner by adaptively scaling the loser gradient according to\nits alignment with the winner gradient. A first-order analysis yields a\nclosed-form scaling coefficient that guarantees the error of the preferred\noutput is non-increasing at each optimization step. Our method is simple,\nmodel-agnostic, broadly compatible with existing DPO-style alignment frameworks\nand adds only marginal computational overhead. Across standard text-to-image\nbenchmarks, Diffusion-SDPO delivers consistent gains over preference-learning\nbaselines on automated preference, aesthetic, and prompt alignment metrics.\nCode is publicly available at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/Diffusion-SDPO.",

Mixing improves robustness but misaligned masks yield\nsoft label ambiguity. Diffusion synthesis increases apparent diversity but,\nwhen trained as common samples, overlooks the structural benefit of mask\nconditioning and introduces synthetic-real domain shift. We propose a paired,\ndiffusion-guided paradigm that fuses the strengths of both. For each real\nimage, a synthetic counterpart is generated under the same mask and the pair is\nused as a controllable input for Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing (MCPMix), which\nmixes only image appearance while supervision always uses the original hard\nmask. This produces a continuous family of intermediate samples that smoothly\nbridges synthetic and real appearances under shared geometry, enlarging\ndiversity without compromising pixel-level semantics. To keep learning aligned\nwith real data, Real-Anchored Learnable Annealing (RLA) adaptively adjusts the\nmixing strength and the loss weight of mixed samples over training, gradually\nre-anchoring optimization to real data and mitigating distributional bias.\nAcross Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, a private NPC-LES cohort, and ISIC\n2017, the approach achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and\nconsistent gains over baselines.

Considering that many robotic tasks --\nparticularly those involving locomotion -- require periodic behaviors across\nvarying timescales, the ability to discover diverse periodic skills is\nessential. Motivated by this, we propose Periodic Skill Discovery (PSD), a\nframework that discovers periodic behaviors in an unsupervised manner. The key\nidea of PSD is to train an encoder that maps states to a circular latent space,\nthereby naturally encoding periodicity in the latent representation. By\ncapturing temporal distance, PSD can effectively learn skills with diverse\nperiods in complex robotic tasks, even with pixel-based observations. We\nfurther show that these learned skills achieve high performance on downstream\ntasks such as hurdling. Moreover, integrating PSD with an existing skill\ndiscovery method offers more diverse behaviors, thus broadening the agent's\nrepertoire.

To explore this challenge, we focus on the\ntask of gift wrapping, which exemplifies a long-horizon manipulation problem\ninvolving precise folding, controlled creasing, and secure fixation of paper.\nSuccess is achieved when the robot completes the sequence to produce a neatly\nwrapped package with clean folds and no tears.\n  We propose a learning-based framework that integrates a high-level task\nplanner powered by a large language model (LLM) with a low-level hybrid\nimitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) policy. At its core is\na Sub-task Aware Robotic Transformer (START) that learns a unified policy from\nhuman demonstrations. The key novelty lies in capturing long-range temporal\ndependencies across the full wrapping sequence within a single model. Unlike\nvanilla Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT), typically applied to short\ntasks, our method introduces sub-task IDs that provide explicit temporal\ngrounding. This enables robust performance across the entire wrapping process\nand supports flexible execution, as the policy learns sub-goals rather than\nmerely replicating motion sequences.\n  Our framework achieves a 97% success rate on real-world wrapping tasks.

            "summary": "Anticipating forthcoming surgical events is vital for real-time assistance in\nendonasal transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, where visibility is limited and\nworkflow changes rapidly. Most visual question answering (VQA) systems reason\non isolated frames with static vision language alignment, providing little\nsupport for forecasting next steps or instrument needs. Existing surgical VQA\ndatasets likewise center on the current scene rather than the near future. We\nintroduce PitVQA-Anticipation, the first VQA dataset designed for forward\nlooking surgical reasoning. It comprises 33.5 hours of operative video and\n734,769 question answer pairs built from temporally grouped clips and expert\nannotations across four tasks: predicting the future phase, next step, upcoming\ninstrument, and remaining duration. We further propose SurgAnt-ViVQA, a video\nlanguage model that adapts a large language model using a GRU Gated Temporal\nCross-Attention module. A bidirectional GRU encodes frame to frame dynamics,\nwhile an adaptive gate injects visual context into the language stream at the\ntoken level. Parameter efficient fine tuning customizes the language backbone\nto the surgical domain. SurgAnt-ViVQA tested upon on PitVQA-Anticipation and\nEndoVis datasets, surpassing strong image and video based baselines. Ablations\nshow that temporal recurrence and gated fusion drive most of the gains. A frame\nbudget study indicates a trade-off: 8 frames maximize fluency, whereas 32\nframes slightly reduce BLEU but improve numeric time estimation. By pairing a\ntemporally aware encoder with fine grained gated cross-attention, SurgAnt-ViVQA\nadvances surgical VQA from retrospective description to proactive anticipation.\nPitVQA-Anticipation offers a comprehensive benchmark for this setting and\nhighlights the importance of targeted temporal modeling for reliable, future\naware surgical assistance.",

This review compares four major transfer\nstrategies by evaluating velocity requirements, flight durations, and fuel\nefficiency, and by identifying their suitability for both crewed and robotic\nmissions. The emerging role of artificial intelligence and machine learning is\nhighlighted: convolutional neural networks support automated crater recognition\nand digital terrain model generation, while deep reinforcement learning enables\nadaptive trajectory refinement during descent and landing to reduce risk and\ndecision latency. The study also examines how GNSS-Reflectometry and advanced\nPositioning, Navigation, and Timing architectures can extend navigation\ncapabilities beyond current limits. GNSS-R can act as a bistatic radar for\nmapping lunar ice, soil properties, and surface topography, while PNT systems\nsupport autonomous rendezvous, Lagrange point station-keeping, and coordinated\nsatellite swarm operations.

We propose a depth-guided liver landmark segmentation\nframework integrating semantic and geometric cues via vision foundation\nencoders.

This enables efficient\nfine-tuning of high-dimensional attention layers without sacrificing\nrepresentational power. A cross-attention fusion module further integrates RGB\nand depth cues. To assess cross-dataset generalization, we also construct a new\nLaparoscopic Liver Surgical Dataset (LLSD) as an external validation benchmark.\nOn the public L3D dataset, our method achieves a 4.85% improvement in Dice\nSimilarity Coefficient and a 11.78-point reduction in Average Symmetric Surface\nDistance compared to the D2GPLand.

We propose IC DefectNCD, a support set free\nframework that leverages Image Intrinsic Priors in IC SEM images for defect\ndetection and novel class discovery. We first develop Self Normal Information\nGuided IC Defect Detection, aggregating representative normal features via a\nlearnable normal information extractor and using reconstruction residuals to\ncoarsely localize defect regions. To handle saliency variations across defects,\nwe introduce an adaptive binarization strategy that produces stable subimages\nfocused on core defective areas. Finally, we design Self Defect Information\nGuided IC Defect Classification, which incorporates a soft mask guided\nattention mechanism to inject spatial defect priors into the teacher student\nmodel. This enhances sensitivity to defective regions, suppresses background\ninterference, and enables recognition and classification of unseen defects. We\nvalidate the approach on a real world dataset spanning three key fabrication\nstages and covering 15 defect types.

            "summary": "In orthodontic treatment, particularly within telemedicine contexts,\nobserving patients' dental occlusion from multiple viewpoints facilitates\ntimely clinical decision-making. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS) have shown strong potential in 3D reconstruction and novel view\nsynthesis. However, conventional 3DGS pipelines typically rely on densely\ncaptured multi-view inputs and precisely initialized camera poses, limiting\ntheir practicality. Orthodontic cases, in contrast, often comprise only three\nsparse images, specifically, the anterior view and bilateral buccal views,\nrendering the reconstruction task especially challenging. The extreme sparsity\nof input views severely degrades reconstruction quality, while the absence of\ncamera pose information further complicates the process. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose DentalSplat, an effective framework for 3D\nreconstruction from sparse orthodontic imagery. Our method leverages a\nprior-guided dense stereo reconstruction model to initialize the point cloud,\nfollowed by a scale-adaptive pruning strategy to improve the training\nefficiency and reconstruction quality of 3DGS. In scenarios with extremely\nsparse viewpoints, we further incorporate optical flow as a geometric\nconstraint, coupled with gradient regularization, to enhance rendering\nfidelity. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset comprising 950\nclinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases designed to\nsimulate real-world remote orthodontic imaging conditions. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method effectively handles sparse input scenarios and\nachieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion\nvisualization, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.",

Dependable perception is one of the initial stages\nfor ISC-aware robots. However, this is hampered by the absence of a dedicated\nimage corpus, as collecting photographs on active construction sites is\nlogistically difficult and raises safety and privacy concerns. In response, we\nintroduce ISC-Perception, the first hybrid dataset expressly designed for ISC\ncomponent detection. It blends procedurally rendered CAD images, game-engine\nphotorealistic scenes, and a limited, curated set of real photographs, enabling\nfully automatic labelling of the synthetic portion. We explicitly account for\nall human effort to produce the dataset, including simulation engine and scene\nsetup, asset preparation, post-processing scripts and quality checks; our total\nhuman time to generate a 10,000-image dataset was 30.5,h versus 166.7,h for\nmanual labelling at 60,s per image (-81.7%). A manual pilot on a representative\nimage with five instances of ISC members took 60,s (maximum 80,s), anchoring\nthe manual baseline.
