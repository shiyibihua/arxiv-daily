Our\nvideos are sourced from existing datasets and egocentric real-world recordings,\nwith high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline.\nITTO captures the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity\ncharacteristic of real-world scenes -- factors that are largely absent in\ncurrent benchmarks. We conduct a rigorous analysis of state-of-the-art tracking\nmethods on ITTO, breaking down performance along key axes of motion complexity.\nOur findings reveal that existing trackers struggle with these challenges,\nparticularly in re-identifying points after occlusion, highlighting critical\nfailure modes. These results point to the need for new modeling approaches\ntailored to real-world dynamics. We envision ITTO as a foundation testbed for\nadvancing point tracking and guiding the development of more robust tracking\nalgorithms."

      "summary": "Planning with world models offers a powerful paradigm for robotic control.\nConventional approaches train a model to predict future frames conditioned on\ncurrent frames and actions, which can then be used for planning. However, the\nobjective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning\nobjective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good\nplanning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future\nframes as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic\ninformation about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world\nmodeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in\nfuture frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the\nsame tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can\nbe trained as \"semantic\" world models through a supervised finetuning process\non image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while\ninheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the\npretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic\nworld model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks,\nleading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of\nreconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling.

Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables\nresearch into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized\nsubsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential\nediting, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a\n56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;\nand (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction\nrewriting and summarization capabilities.

The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight\nquantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based\ninitialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the\ninitial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based\non Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;\nand (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation.

This\nmodular decomposition allows us to leverage the distinct strengths of different\nscales of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) at each stage, creating a\nsystem that is powerful in its reasoning, grounding and practical control.\nLaViRA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the\nVLN-CE benchmark, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities in unseen\nenvironments, while maintaining transparency and efficiency for real-world\ndeployment."

Moreover, current inference-time\ninterventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of\nmoving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt\nexpansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood\nestimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image\ndiversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data."

However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in\nvisual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,\ntemporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),\nand counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark\nevaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures\nand proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We\nstudy the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task\nunder controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are\nhighly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,\nand the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors\nare due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output\nspace. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer\nimproves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving\nconsistent improvements on real-world datasets."

In\ncontrast, non-expert data -- such as play data, suboptimal demonstrations,\npartial task completions, or rollouts from suboptimal policies -- can offer\nbroader coverage and lower collection costs. However, conventional imitation\nlearning approaches fail to utilize this data effectively. To address these\nchallenges, we posit that with right design decisions, offline reinforcement\nlearning can be used as a tool to harness non-expert data to enhance the\nperformance of imitation learning policies.

Our approach shows that broadening\nthe support of the policy distribution can allow imitation algorithms augmented\nby offline RL to solve tasks robustly, showing considerably enhanced recovery\nand generalization behavior. In manipulation tasks, these innovations\nsignificantly increase the range of initial conditions where learned policies\nare successful when non-expert data is incorporated.

This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network\n(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of\npattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory\nbank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as\nrelational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism\nto provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded\nanatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring\ngeometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust\nspatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that\nsynergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of\nMamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of\nself-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks\ndemonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE\nof 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain\ngeneralization capability.

Sensitive regions\nare secured using a hybrid scheme that employs symmetric encryption for\nefficiency and Attribute-Based Encryption for policy enforcement. The system\nsupports efficient key distribution and isolates key storage to strengthen\noverall security. To demonstrate its applicability, we evaluate the system on\nvisual datasets, where Privacy-Sensitive Objects in images are automatically\ndetected, reassessed, and selectively encrypted prior to sharing in a data\nrepository. Experimental results show that our system provides effective PSO\ndetection, increases macro-averaged F1 score (5%) and mean Average Precision\n(10%), and maintains an average policy-enforced decryption time of less than 1\nsecond per image. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and\nscalability of our proposed solution for fine-grained access control."

To\naddress these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action\nrecognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low\ncomputational cost.

In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to\ncombine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization\nduring training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct\nachieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while\nmaintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across\nall three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition\naccuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing\nrecognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second.

      "summary": "While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant\nprogress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major\nchallenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce\nadditional data for further training or incorporate external or internal\ninformation during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce\nextra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in\nMLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual\ntokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the\nmodel's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As\na result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn\nexacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we\npropose \\textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that\nleverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical\nvisual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our\nknowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation\nin MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs\nnearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be\nseamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those\nspecifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on\nseveral widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream\nMLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the\neffectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly\navailable."

      "summary": "Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos,\noften leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5\nyears. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared\nimages with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,\nand most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.\nTherefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.\nIn this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract\ndeep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as\nmalaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks\nemployed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention\nNetwork, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and\nXceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available\nmalaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%\nrespectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These\nfindings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for\nautomatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual\ninvolvement."

      "summary": "Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their\nability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While\nadvances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions\nin sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and\noverlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We\nintroduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay\nfootage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game\nCounter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent\ndecision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric\nvideo streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives\nalong with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose\nCross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric\nvisual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an\nindividual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location\nprediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's\nability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single\nfirst-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and\nCECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in\nesports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed\nfor multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for\nspatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world\ndomains.
