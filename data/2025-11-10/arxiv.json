      "summary": "Despite years of research, real-time diverse grasp synthesis for dexterous\nhands remains an unsolved core challenge in robotics and computer graphics. We\npresent Lightning Grasp, a novel high-performance procedural grasp synthesis\nalgorithm that achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over state-of-the-art\napproaches, while enabling unsupervised grasp generation for irregular,\ntool-like objects. The method avoids many limitations of prior approaches, such\nas the need for carefully tuned energy functions and sensitive initialization.\nThis breakthrough is driven by a key insight: decoupling complex geometric\ncomputation from the search process via a simple, efficient data structure -\nthe Contact Field. This abstraction collapses the problem complexity, enabling\na procedural search at unprecedented speeds. We open-source our system to\npropel further innovation in robotic manipulation."

Recent video generation models can\nsynthesize photorealistic visual demonstrations from language commands and\nimages, offering a powerful yet underexplored source of training signals for\nrobotics. However, directly retargeting pixel motions from generated videos to\nrobots neglects physics, often resulting in inaccurate manipulations. PhysWorld\naddresses this limitation by coupling video generation with physical world\nreconstruction. Given a single image and a task command, our method generates\ntask-conditioned videos and reconstructs the underlying physical world from the\nvideos, and the generated video motions are grounded into physically accurate\nactions through object-centric residual reinforcement learning with the\nphysical world model. This synergy transforms implicit visual guidance into\nphysically executable robotic trajectories, eliminating the need for real robot\ndata collection and enabling zero-shot generalizable robotic manipulation.\nExperiments on diverse real-world tasks demonstrate that PhysWorld\nsubstantially improves manipulation accuracy compared to previous approaches.\nVisit \\href{https://pointscoder.github.io/PhysWorld_Web/}{the project webpage}\nfor details."

To address these limitations, we introduce\nSpatialThinker, a 3D-aware MLLM trained with RL to integrate structured spatial\ngrounding with multi-step reasoning. The model simulates human-like spatial\nperception by constructing a scene graph of task-relevant objects and spatial\nrelations, and reasoning towards an answer via dense spatial rewards.\nSpatialThinker consists of two key contributions: (1) a data synthesis pipeline\nthat generates STVQA-7K, a high-quality spatial VQA dataset, and (2) online RL\nwith a multi-objective dense spatial reward enforcing spatial grounding.\nSpatialThinker-7B outperforms supervised fine-tuning and the sparse RL baseline\non spatial understanding and real-world VQA benchmarks, nearly doubling the\nbase-model gain compared to sparse RL, and surpassing GPT-4o.

Recent advances in video diffusion have markedly improved\ntemporal consistency and sampling efficiency for offline generation.

Besides, scalable\nmulti-GPU serving for real-time streams remains largely unresolved so far. To\naddress this, we present StreamDiffusionV2, a training-free pipeline for\ninteractive live streaming with video diffusion models. StreamDiffusionV2\nintegrates an SLO-aware batching scheduler and a block scheduler, together with\na sink-token--guided rolling KV cache, a motion-aware noise controller, and\nother system-level optimizations.

In light of such data constraints, we explore an\ninference-time scaling approach using a domain-adapted CLIP-based verifier for\nenhanced infrared image generation quality. We adapt FLUX.1-dev, a\nstate-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model, to the infrared domain by\nfinetuning it on a small sample of infrared images using parameter-efficient\ntechniques.

In\nthe last decade, a large body of work has emerged on local robustness, i.e.,\nchecking if the decision of a neural network remains unchanged when the input\nis slightly perturbed. However, many of these approaches require specialized\nencoding and often ignore the confidence of a neural network on its output. In\nthis paper, our goal is to build a generalized framework to specify and verify\nvariants of robustness in neural network verification. We propose a\nspecification framework using a simple grammar, which is flexible enough to\ncapture most existing variants. This allows us to introduce new variants of\nrobustness that take into account the confidence of the neural network in its\noutputs. Next, we develop a novel and powerful unified technique to verify all\nsuch variants in a homogeneous way, viz., by adding a few additional layers to\nthe neural network. This enables us to use any state-of-the-art neural network\nverification tool, without having to tinker with the encoding within, while\nincurring an approximation error that we show is bounded. We perform an\nextensive experimental evaluation over a large suite of 8870 benchmarks having\n138M parameters in a largest network, and show that we are able to capture a\nwide set of robustness variants and outperform direct encoding approaches by a\nsignificant margin."

While it is straightforward to look at\nsituations where the model fails, it is hard to understand the underlying\nreason. This motivates us to conduct a systematic study, where inputs to the\nmodel are perturbed and the predictions observed. We introduce PlanT 2.0, a\nlightweight, object-centric planning transformer designed for autonomous\ndriving research in CARLA. The object-level representation enables controlled\nanalysis, as the input can be easily perturbed (e.g., by changing the location\nor adding or removing certain objects), in contrast to sensor-based models. To\ntackle the scenarios newly introduced by the challenging CARLA Leaderboard 2.0,\nwe introduce multiple upgrades to PlanT, achieving state-of-the-art performance\non Longest6 v2, Bench2Drive, and the CARLA validation routes. Our analysis\nexposes insightful failures, such as a lack of scene understanding caused by\nlow obstacle diversity, rigid expert behaviors leading to exploitable\nshortcuts, and overfitting to a fixed set of expert trajectories.

For KV cache compression, StreamKV\nintroduces a guidance prompt designed to capture the key semantic elements\nwithin each segment, ensuring only the most informative KV caches are retained\nfor answering questions. Moreover, StreamKV unifies KV cache retrieval and\ncompression within a single module, performing both in a layer-adaptive manner,\nthereby further improving the effectiveness of streaming video question\nanswering.

This\nhighlights the urgent need for continuously updating AI-generated image\ndetectors to adapt to new generators. To overcome low efficiency and\ncatastrophic forgetting in detector updates, we propose LiteUpdate, a\nlightweight framework for updating AI-generated image detectors. LiteUpdate\nemploys a representative sample selection module that leverages image\nconfidence and gradient-based discriminative features to precisely select\nboundary samples. This approach improves learning and detection accuracy on new\ndistributions with limited generated images, significantly enhancing detector\nupdate efficiency. Additionally, LiteUpdate incorporates a model merging module\nthat fuses weights from multiple fine-tuning trajectories, including\npre-trained, representative, and random updates. This balances the adaptability\nto new generators and mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge.\nExperiments demonstrate that LiteUpdate substantially boosts detection\nperformance in various detectors. Specifically, on AIDE, the average detection\naccuracy on Midjourney improved from 87.63% to 93.03%, a 6.16% relative\nincrease."

In this paper, we present a\nframework that decouples motion planning from vehicle control through a spatial\nand temporal alignment strategy between a virtual vehicle and the real system.\nAn RL agent is first trained in simulation using a kinematic bicycle model to\noutput continuous control actions. Its behavior is then distilled into a\ntrajectory-predicting agent that generates finite-horizon ego-vehicle\ntrajectories, enabling synchronization between virtual and real vehicles. At\ndeployment, a Stanley controller governs lateral dynamics, while longitudinal\nalignment is maintained through adaptive update mechanisms that compensate for\ndeviations between virtual and real trajectories.

To address these problems, this paper proposes TauFlow, a novel\nlightweight segmentation model. The core of TauFlow is a dynamic feature\nresponse strategy inspired by brain-like mechanisms. This is achieved through\ntwo key innovations: the Convolutional Long-Time Constant Cell (ConvLTC), which\ndynamically regulates the feature update rate to \"slowly\" process low-frequency\nbackgrounds and \"quickly\" respond to high-frequency boundaries; and the STDP\nSelf-Organizing Module, which significantly mitigates feature conflicts between\nthe encoder and decoder, reducing the conflict rate from approximately 35%-40%\nto 8%-10%."

Data augmentation via synthetic fake face generation\neffectively enhances generalization, yet current SoTA methods rely on fixed\nstrategies-raising a key question: Is a single static augmentation sufficient,\nor does the diversity of forgery features demand dynamic approaches? We argue\nexisting methods overlook the evolving complexity of real-world forgeries\n(e.g., facial warping, expression manipulation), which fixed policies cannot\nfully simulate. To address this, we propose CRDA (Curriculum\nReinforcement-Learning Data Augmentation), a novel framework guiding detectors\nto progressively master multi-domain forgery features from simple to complex.\nCRDA synthesizes augmented samples via a configurable pool of forgery\noperations and dynamically generates adversarial samples tailored to the\ndetector's current learning state. Central to our approach is integrating\nreinforcement learning (RL) and causal inference. An RL agent dynamically\nselects augmentation actions based on detector performance to efficiently\nexplore the vast augmentation space, adapting to increasingly challenging\nforgeries. Simultaneously, the agent introduces action space variations to\ngenerate heterogeneous forgery patterns, guided by causal inference to mitigate\nspurious correlations-suppressing task-irrelevant biases and focusing on\ncausally invariant features. This integration ensures robust generalization by\ndecoupling synthetic augmentation patterns from the model's learned\nrepresentations.

This paper investigates a novel and\npractical adversarial threat scenario: attacking downstream models or MLLMs\nfine-tuned from open-source VFMs, without requiring access to the victim task,\ntraining data, model query, and architecture. In contrast to conventional\ntransfer-based attacks that rely on task-aligned surrogate models, we\ndemonstrate that adversarial vulnerabilities can be exploited directly from the\nVFMs. To this end, we propose the Transferable Video Attack (TVA), a\ntemporal-aware adversarial attack method that leverages the temporal\nrepresentation dynamics of VFMs to craft effective perturbations. TVA\nintegrates a bidirectional contrastive learning mechanism to maximize the\ndiscrepancy between the clean and adversarial features, and introduces a\ntemporal consistency loss that exploits motion cues to enhance the sequential\nimpact of perturbations. TVA avoids the need to train expensive surrogate\nmodels or access to domain-specific data, thereby offering a more practical and\nefficient attack strategy.

Conventional defense\nmechanisms struggle to address the evolving landscape of multifaceted attack\npatterns. Through systematic analysis of existing defenses, we identify that\ntheir unsatisfactory performance primarily originates from an entangled feature\nspace, where adversarial attacks can be performed easily. To this end, we\npresent 3D-ANC, a novel approach that capitalizes on the Neural Collapse (NC)\nmechanism to orchestrate discriminative feature learning. In particular, NC\ndepicts where last-layer features and classifier weights jointly evolve into a\nsimplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) arrangement, establishing maximally\nseparable class prototypes. However, leveraging this advantage in 3D\nrecognition confronts two substantial challenges: (1) prevalent class imbalance\nin point cloud datasets, and (2) complex geometric similarities between object\ncategories. To tackle these obstacles, our solution combines an ETF-aligned\nclassification module with an adaptive training framework consisting of\nrepresentation-balanced learning (RBL) and dynamic feature direction loss\n(FDL). 3D-ANC seamlessly empowers existing models to develop disentangled\nfeature spaces despite the complexity in 3D data distribution. Comprehensive\nevaluations state that 3D-ANC significantly improves the robustness of models\nwith various structures on two datasets. For instance, DGCNN's classification\naccuracy is elevated from 27.2% to 80.9% on ModelNet40 -- a 53.7% absolute gain\nthat surpasses leading baselines by 34.0%."

Existing certified defenses\nlimit point-wise perturbations but overlook subtle geometric distortions that\npreserve individual points yet alter the overall structure, potentially leading\nto misclassification. In this work, we propose FreqCert, a novel certification\nframework that departs from conventional spatial domain defenses by shifting\nrobustness analysis to the frequency domain, enabling structured certification\nagainst global L2-bounded perturbations. FreqCert first transforms the input\npoint cloud via the graph Fourier transform (GFT), then applies structured\nfrequency-aware subsampling to generate multiple sub-point clouds. Each\nsub-cloud is independently classified by a standard model, and the final\nprediction is obtained through majority voting, where sub-clouds are\nconstructed based on spectral similarity rather than spatial proximity, making\nthe partitioning more stable under L2 perturbations and better aligned with the\nobject's intrinsic structure. We derive a closed-form lower bound on the\ncertified L2 robustness radius and prove its tightness under minimal and\ninterpretable assumptions, establishing a theoretical foundation for frequency\ndomain certification. Extensive experiments on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN\ndatasets demonstrate that FreqCert consistently achieves higher certified\naccuracy and empirical accuracy under strong perturbations.

However,\nexisting methods face two key limitations. Firstly, they often over-rely on\nhigh-certainty keywords that explicitly identify the target object while\nneglecting critical spatial descriptions. Secondly, generalized textual\nfeatures contain both 2D and 3D descriptive information, thereby capturing an\nadditional dimension of details compared to singular 2D or 3D visual features.\nThis characteristic leads to cross-dimensional interference when refining\nvisual features under text guidance. To overcome these challenges, we propose\nMono3DVG-EnSD, a novel framework that integrates two key components: the\nCLIP-Guided Lexical Certainty Adapter (CLIP-LCA) and the Dimension-Decoupled\nModule (D2M). The CLIP-LCA dynamically masks high-certainty keywords while\nretaining low-certainty implicit spatial descriptions, thereby forcing the\nmodel to develop a deeper understanding of spatial relationships in captions\nfor object localization. Meanwhile, the D2M decouples dimension-specific\n(2D/3D) textual features from generalized textual features to guide\ncorresponding visual features at same dimension, which mitigates\ncross-dimensional interference by ensuring dimensionally-consistent cross-modal\ninteractions. Through comprehensive comparisons and ablation studies on the\nMono3DRefer dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance\nacross all metrics.

Recently, denoisers\ninduced by generative priors have been successfully integrated into regularized\noptimization methods for image restoration under Gaussian noise. However, their\napplication to non-Gaussian noise--such as impulse noise--remains largely\nunexplored. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play image restoration\nframework based on generative diffusion priors for robust removal of general\nnoise types, including impulse noise. Within the maximum a posteriori (MAP)\nestimation framework, the data fidelity term is adapted to the specific noise\nmodel. Departing from the conventional least-squares loss used for Gaussian\nnoise, we introduce a generalized Gaussian scale mixture-based loss, which\napproximates a wide range of noise distributions and leads to an $\\ell_q$-norm\n($0<q\\leq2$) fidelity term. This optimization problem is addressed using an\niteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach, wherein the proximal step\ninvolving the generative prior is efficiently performed via a diffusion-based\ndenoiser. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed method effectively removes non-Gaussian impulse noise and achieves\nsuperior restoration performance."

Yet, dense disparity\nsupervision is nearly impossible due to anatomical constraints, typically\nlimiting annotations to only a few image-level labels acquired before the\nendoscope enters deep body cavities. Teacher-Student Learning (TSL) offers a\npromising solution by leveraging a teacher trained on sparse labels to generate\npseudo labels and associated confidence maps from abundant unlabeled surgical\nvideos. However, existing TSL methods are confined to image-level supervision,\nproviding only spatial confidence and lacking temporal consistency estimation.\nThis absence of spatio-temporal reliability results in unstable disparity\npredictions and severe flickering artifacts across video frames. To overcome\nthese challenges, we propose TiS-TSL, a novel time-switchable teacher-student\nlearning framework for video stereo matching under minimal supervision. At its\ncore is a unified model that operates in three distinct modes: Image-Prediction\n(IP), Forward Video-Prediction (FVP), and Backward Video-Prediction (BVP),\nenabling flexible temporal modeling within a single architecture. Enabled by\nthis unified model, TiS-TSL adopts a two-stage learning strategy. The\nImage-to-Video (I2V) stage transfers sparse image-level knowledge to initialize\ntemporal modeling. The subsequent Video-to-Video (V2V) stage refines temporal\ndisparity predictions by comparing forward and backward predictions to\ncalculate bidirectional spatio-temporal consistency. This consistency\nidentifies unreliable regions across frames, filters noisy video-level pseudo\nlabels, and enforces temporal coherence. Experimental results on two public\ndatasets demonstrate that TiS-TSL exceeds other image-based state-of-the-arts\nby improving TEPE and EPE by at least 2.11% and 4.54%, respectively.."

This paper presents a frame-\nwork to bridge this gap, delivering context-aware navigation on an affordable\nrobotic platform. Our approach centers on a novel, tight integration of a\nlightweight perception module with an online A* planner. The perception system\nemploys a semantic segmentation model to identify user-defined visual\nconstraints, enabling the robot to navigate based on contextual importance\nrather than physical size alone. This adaptability allows an operator to define\nwhat is critical for a given task, be it sensitive papers in an office or\nsafety lines in a factory, thus resolving the ambiguity of what to avoid. This\nsemantic perception is seamlessly fused with geometric data. The identified\nvisual constraints are projected as non-geometric obstacles onto a global map\nthat is continuously updated from sensor data, enabling robust navigation\nthrough both partially known and unknown environments. We validate our\nframework through extensive experiments in high-fidelity simulations and on a\nreal-world robotic platform.

HiMo-CLIP introduces two key\ncomponents: a hierarchical decomposition (HiDe) module that extracts latent\nsemantic components from long-form text via in-batch PCA, enabling flexible,\nbatch-aware alignment across different semantic granularities, and a\nmonotonicity-aware contrastive loss (MoLo) that jointly aligns global and\ncomponent-level representations, encouraging the model to internalize semantic\nordering and alignment strength as a function of textual completeness.These\ncomponents work in concert to produce structured, cognitively-aligned\ncross-modal representations. Experiments on multiple image-text retrieval\nbenchmarks show that HiMo-CLIP consistently outperforms strong baselines,\nparticularly under long or compositional descriptions.

Unlike prior approaches that feed text-derived SEG\ntoken embeddings into segmentation models, NOVO instead generates a coarse mask\nand point prompts from the VLM output. These visual prompts are compatible with\nthe Segment Anything Model (SAM), preserving alignment with its pretrained\ncapabilities. To further enhance boundary quality and enable instance-level\nsegmentation, we introduce a training-free refinement module that reduces\nvisual artifacts and improves the quality of segmentation masks. We also\npresent RISeg, a new benchmark comprising 918 images, 2,533 instance-level\nmasks, and diverse reasoning queries to evaluate this task. Experiments\ndemonstrate that NOVO achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple\nmetrics and model sizes, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability in\nreasoning segmentation."

While recent\napproaches leverage a limited amount of labeled target-domain data to improve\nperformance, the severe imbalance between abundant source data and scarce\ntarget data remains a critical challenge for effective representation learning.\nWe present the first frequency-space perspective to analyze this issue and\nidentify two key challenges: (1) models are easily biased toward\nsource-specific knowledge encoded in the low-frequency components of source\ndata, and (2) the sparsity of target data hinders the learning of\nhigh-frequency, domain-generalizable features. To address these challenges, we\npropose \\textbf{FreqGRL}, a novel CD-FSL framework that mitigates the impact of\ndata imbalance in the frequency space. Specifically, we introduce a\nLow-Frequency Replacement (LFR) module that substitutes the low-frequency\ncomponents of source tasks with those from the target domain to create new\nsource tasks that better align with target characteristics, thus reducing\nsource-specific biases and promoting generalizable representation learning. We\nfurther design a High-Frequency Enhancement (HFE) module that filters out\nlow-frequency components and performs learning directly on high-frequency\nfeatures in the frequency space to improve cross-domain generalization.\nAdditionally, a Global Frequency Filter (GFF) is incorporated to suppress noisy\nor irrelevant frequencies and emphasize informative ones, mitigating\noverfitting risks under limited target supervision. Extensive experiments on\nfive standard CD-FSL benchmarks demonstrate that our frequency-guided framework\nachieves state-of-the-art performance."

Existing methods typically treat\nanomaly detection and classification as separate tasks, thereby neglecting\ntheir inherent correlation, limiting information sharing, and resulting in\nsuboptimal performance. To address this, we propose UniADC, a unified anomaly\ndetection and classification model that can effectively perform both tasks with\nonly a few or even no anomaly images. Specifically, UniADC consists of two key\ncomponents: a training-free controllable inpainting network and a multi-task\ndiscriminator. The inpainting network can synthesize anomaly images of specific\ncategories by repainting normal regions guided by anomaly priors, and can also\nrepaint few-shot anomaly samples to augment the available anomaly data. The\nmulti-task discriminator is then trained on these synthesized samples, enabling\nprecise anomaly detection and classification by aligning fine-grained image\nfeatures with anomaly-category embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on\nthree anomaly detection and classification datasets, including MVTec-FS, MTD,\nand WFDD, and the results demonstrate that UniADC consistently outperforms\nexisting methods in anomaly detection, localization, and classification.

Furthermore, we introduce a reciprocal mechanism\nthrough which identity and dynamics reinforce each other, enhancing both\nintegrity and consistency.

However, most existing approaches treat these\ndomains as independent tasks, overlooking their physiological interplay and\nshared imaging biomarkers. We propose an Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning\nFramework that enables interpretable cardiopulmonary risk assessment from a\nsingle LDCT scan. The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that\nemulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then\nreasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a\ncardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three\nsynergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung\nabnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their\ncardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes\nstructural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic\ncardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically\ngrounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed\nframework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality\nprediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines.\nBeyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning\nthat aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between\npulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms. Overall, this work\nestablishes a unified and explainable paradigm for cardiovascular analysis from\nLDCT, bridging the gap between image-based prediction and mechanism-based\nmedical interpretation."

To achieve this, a pervasive paradigm is to leverage the rich\nvision-semantic priors of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, the\nfundamental question persists: How do VLAs effectively inherit the prior\nknowledge from VLMs? To address this critical question, we introduce a\ndiagnostic benchmark, GrinningFace, an emoji tabletop manipulation task where\nthe robot arm is asked to place objects onto printed emojis corresponding to\nlanguage instructions. This task design is particularly revealing -- knowledge\nassociated with emojis is ubiquitous in Internet-scale datasets used for VLM\npre-training, yet emojis themselves are largely absent from standard robotics\ndatasets. Consequently, they provide a clean proxy: successful task completion\nindicates effective transfer of VLM priors to embodied control. We implement\nthis diagnostic task in both simulated environment and a real robot, and\ncompare various promising techniques for knowledge transfer. Specifically, we\ninvestigate the effects of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, VLM freezing,\nco-training, predicting discretized actions, and predicting latent actions.\nThrough systematic evaluation, our work not only demonstrates the critical\nimportance of preserving VLM priors for the generalization of VLA but also\nestablishes guidelines for future research in developing truly generalizable\nembodied AI systems."
