We\npresent Lightning Grasp, a novel high-performance procedural grasp synthesis\nalgorithm that achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over state-of-the-art\napproaches, while enabling unsupervised grasp generation for irregular,\ntool-like objects. The method avoids many limitations of prior approaches, such\nas the need for carefully tuned energy functions and sensitive initialization.\nThis breakthrough is driven by a key insight: decoupling complex geometric\ncomputation from the search process via a simple, efficient data structure -\nthe Contact Field. This abstraction collapses the problem complexity, enabling\na procedural search at unprecedented speeds. We open-source our system to\npropel further innovation in robotic manipulation.",

Recent video generation models can\nsynthesize photorealistic visual demonstrations from language commands and\nimages, offering a powerful yet underexplored source of training signals for\nrobotics. However, directly retargeting pixel motions from generated videos to\nrobots neglects physics, often resulting in inaccurate manipulations. PhysWorld\naddresses this limitation by coupling video generation with physical world\nreconstruction. Given a single image and a task command, our method generates\ntask-conditioned videos and reconstructs the underlying physical world from the\nvideos, and the generated video motions are grounded into physically accurate\nactions through object-centric residual reinforcement learning with the\nphysical world model. This synergy transforms implicit visual guidance into\nphysically executable robotic trajectories, eliminating the need for real robot\ndata collection and enabling zero-shot generalizable robotic manipulation.\nExperiments on diverse real-world tasks demonstrate that PhysWorld\nsubstantially improves manipulation accuracy compared to previous approaches.\nVisit \\href{https://pointscoder.github.io/PhysWorld_Web/}{the project webpage}\nfor details.",

However,\nsafety regulations and operational constraints in operating rooms (ORs) limit\nembodied agents from freely perceiving and interacting in realistic settings.\nDigital twins provide high-fidelity, risk-free environments for exploration and\ntraining. How we may create photorealistic and dynamic digital representations\nof ORs that capture relevant spatial, visual, and behavioral complexity remains\nunclear. We introduce TwinOR, a framework for constructing photorealistic,\ndynamic digital twins of ORs for embodied AI research. The system reconstructs\nstatic geometry from pre-scan videos and continuously models human and\nequipment motion through multi-view perception of OR activities. The static and\ndynamic components are fused into an immersive 3D environment that supports\ncontrollable simulation and embodied exploration. The proposed framework\nreconstructs complete OR geometry with centimeter level accuracy while\npreserving dynamic interaction across surgical workflows, enabling realistic\nrenderings and a virtual playground for embodied AI systems. In our\nexperiments, TwinOR simulates stereo and monocular sensor streams for geometry\nunderstanding and visual localization tasks. Models such as FoundationStereo\nand ORB-SLAM3 on TwinOR-synthesized data achieve performance within their\nreported accuracy on real indoor datasets, demonstrating that TwinOR provides\nsensor-level realism sufficient for perception and localization challenges.

Previous image-based streaming\ndiffusion models have powered efficient and creative live streaming products\nbut have hit limits on temporal consistency due to the foundation of\nimage-based designs. Recent advances in video diffusion have markedly improved\ntemporal consistency and sampling efficiency for offline generation.

We introduce FLASH\n(Frequency-aware LiDAR Adaptive Super-resolution with Hierarchical fusion), a\nnovel framework that overcomes these limitations through dual-domain\nprocessing. FLASH integrates two key innovations: (i) Frequency-Aware Window\nAttention that combines local spatial attention with global frequency-domain\nanalysis via FFT, capturing both fine-grained geometry and periodic scanning\npatterns at log-linear complexity. (ii) Adaptive Multi-Scale Fusion that\nreplaces conventional skip connections with learned position-specific feature\naggregation, enhanced by CBAM attention for dynamic feature selection.\nExtensive experiments on KITTI demonstrate that FLASH achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across all evaluation metrics, surpassing even uncertainty-enhanced\nbaselines that require multiple forward passes. Notably, FLASH outperforms\nTULIP with Monte Carlo Dropout while maintaining single-pass efficiency, which\nenables real-time deployment.

While synthetic\ninfrared image generation has the potential to accelerate model development by\nproviding large-scale, diverse training data, training foundation-level\ngenerative diffusion models in the infrared domain has remained elusive due to\nlimited datasets. In light of such data constraints, we explore an\ninference-time scaling approach using a domain-adapted CLIP-based verifier for\nenhanced infrared image generation quality.

The trained verifier is then employed during inference to guide the\ndiffusion sampling process toward higher quality infrared generations that\nbetter align with input text prompts.

We present YoNoSplat, a feedforward model that\nreconstructs high-quality 3D Gaussian Splatting representations from an\narbitrary number of images. Our model is highly versatile, operating\neffectively with both posed and unposed, calibrated and uncalibrated inputs.\nYoNoSplat predicts local Gaussians and camera poses for each view, which are\naggregated into a global representation using either predicted or provided\nposes. To overcome the inherent difficulty of jointly learning 3D Gaussians and\ncamera parameters, we introduce a novel mixing training strategy. This approach\nmitigates the entanglement between the two tasks by initially using\nground-truth poses to aggregate local Gaussians and gradually transitioning to\na mix of predicted and ground-truth poses, which prevents both training\ninstability and exposure bias. We further resolve the scale ambiguity problem\nby a novel pairwise camera-distance normalization scheme and by embedding\ncamera intrinsics into the network. Moreover, YoNoSplat also predicts intrinsic\nparameters, making it feasible for uncalibrated inputs. YoNoSplat demonstrates\nexceptional efficiency, reconstructing a scene from 100 views (at 280x518\nresolution) in just 2.69 seconds on an NVIDIA GH200 GPU.

In\nthe last decade, a large body of work has emerged on local robustness, i.e.,\nchecking if the decision of a neural network remains unchanged when the input\nis slightly perturbed. However, many of these approaches require specialized\nencoding and often ignore the confidence of a neural network on its output. In\nthis paper, our goal is to build a generalized framework to specify and verify\nvariants of robustness in neural network verification. We propose a\nspecification framework using a simple grammar, which is flexible enough to\ncapture most existing variants. This allows us to introduce new variants of\nrobustness that take into account the confidence of the neural network in its\noutputs. Next, we develop a novel and powerful unified technique to verify all\nsuch variants in a homogeneous way, viz., by adding a few additional layers to\nthe neural network. This enables us to use any state-of-the-art neural network\nverification tool, without having to tinker with the encoding within, while\nincurring an approximation error that we show is bounded. We perform an\nextensive experimental evaluation over a large suite of 8870 benchmarks having\n138M parameters in a largest network, and show that we are able to capture a\nwide set of robustness variants and outperform direct encoding approaches by a\nsignificant margin.",

This has led to incremental improvements without a deep\nunderstanding of the current failures. While it is straightforward to look at\nsituations where the model fails, it is hard to understand the underlying\nreason. This motivates us to conduct a systematic study, where inputs to the\nmodel are perturbed and the predictions observed. We introduce PlanT 2.0, a\nlightweight, object-centric planning transformer designed for autonomous\ndriving research in CARLA. The object-level representation enables controlled\nanalysis, as the input can be easily perturbed (e.g., by changing the location\nor adding or removing certain objects), in contrast to sensor-based models. To\ntackle the scenarios newly introduced by the challenging CARLA Leaderboard 2.0,\nwe introduce multiple upgrades to PlanT, achieving state-of-the-art performance\non Longest6 v2, Bench2Drive, and the CARLA validation routes. Our analysis\nexposes insightful failures, such as a lack of scene understanding caused by\nlow obstacle diversity, rigid expert behaviors leading to exploitable\nshortcuts, and overfitting to a fixed set of expert trajectories.

Nonetheless, the characteristics of\nnon-professional acquisition and the subsequent transcoding of UGC video on\nsharing platforms present significant challenges for NR-VQA. Although NR-VQA\nmodels attempt to infer mean opinion scores (MOS), their modeling of subjective\nscores for compressed content remains limited due to the absence of\nfine-grained perceptual annotations of artifact types. To address these\nchallenges, we propose CAMP-VQA, a novel NR-VQA framework that exploits the\nsemantic understanding capabilities of large vision-language models. Our\napproach introduces a quality-aware prompting mechanism that integrates video\nmetadata (e.g., resolution, frame rate, bitrate) with key fragments extracted\nfrom inter-frame variations to guide the BLIP-2 pretraining approach in\ngenerating fine-grained quality captions. A unified architecture has been\ndesigned to model perceptual quality across three dimensions: semantic\nalignment, temporal characteristics, and spatial characteristics. These\nmultimodal features are extracted and fused, then regressed to video quality\nscores. Extensive experiments on a wide variety of UGC datasets demonstrate\nthat our model consistently outperforms existing NR-VQA methods, achieving\nimproved accuracy without the need for costly manual fine-grained annotations.\nOur method achieves the best performance in terms of average rank and linear\ncorrelation (SRCC: 0.928, PLCC: 0.938) compared to state-of-the-art methods.\nThe source code and trained models, along with a user-friendly demo, are\navailable at: https://github.com/xinyiW915/CAMP-VQA.",

These capabilities are rigorously aligned with\nreal-world applications such as multi-sensor synthesis in autonomous systems\nand cross-angle sports analytics. Through extensive evaluation of\nstate-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, we reveal significant\nperformance discrepancies and limitations in current MLLMs' ability to perform\nunderstanding across multiple videos.

Detecting refugee\nshelters in such emergent camps presents substantial challenges, primarily due\nto their dense spatial configuration and irregular geometric patterns. Using\nsub-meter satellite images, we develop a semi-supervised segmentation framework\nthat achieves an F1-score of 76.4% in detecting individual refugee shelters.\nApplying the framework across multi-year data reveals declining WASH\naccessibility, driven by rapid refugee population growth and reduced facility\navailability, rising from 25 people per facility in 2022 to 29.4 in 2025.\nGender-disaggregated analysis further shows that women and girls experience\nreduced accessibility, in scenarios with inadequate safety-related segregation\nin WASH facilities.

To overcome low efficiency and\ncatastrophic forgetting in detector updates, we propose LiteUpdate, a\nlightweight framework for updating AI-generated image detectors. LiteUpdate\nemploys a representative sample selection module that leverages image\nconfidence and gradient-based discriminative features to precisely select\nboundary samples. This approach improves learning and detection accuracy on new\ndistributions with limited generated images, significantly enhancing detector\nupdate efficiency. Additionally, LiteUpdate incorporates a model merging module\nthat fuses weights from multiple fine-tuning trajectories, including\npre-trained, representative, and random updates. This balances the adaptability\nto new generators and mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge.\nExperiments demonstrate that LiteUpdate substantially boosts detection\nperformance in various detectors.

In this paper, we present a\nframework that decouples motion planning from vehicle control through a spatial\nand temporal alignment strategy between a virtual vehicle and the real system.\nAn RL agent is first trained in simulation using a kinematic bicycle model to\noutput continuous control actions. Its behavior is then distilled into a\ntrajectory-predicting agent that generates finite-horizon ego-vehicle\ntrajectories, enabling synchronization between virtual and real vehicles.

In contrast, we introduce a novel perspective for capturing\ncorrespondence context information without extra design modules. To this end,\nwe design a two-view correspondence pruning network called LeCoT, which can\nnaturally leverage global context information at different stages.\nSpecifically, the core design of LeCoT is the Spatial-Channel Fusion\nTransformer block, a newly proposed component that efficiently utilizes both\nspatial and channel global context information among sparse correspondences. In\naddition, we integrate the proposed prediction block that utilizes\ncorrespondence features from intermediate stages to generate a probability set,\nwhich acts as guiding information for subsequent learning phases, allowing the\nnetwork to more effectively capture robust global context information. Notably,\nthis prediction block progressively refines the probability set, thereby\nmitigating the issue of information loss that is common in the traditional one.\nExtensive experiments prove that the proposed LeCoT outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in correspondence pruning, relative pose estimation,\nhomography estimation, visual localization, and $3$D~reconstruction tasks.

Data augmentation via synthetic fake face generation\neffectively enhances generalization, yet current SoTA methods rely on fixed\nstrategies-raising a key question: Is a single static augmentation sufficient,\nor does the diversity of forgery features demand dynamic approaches? We argue\nexisting methods overlook the evolving complexity of real-world forgeries\n(e.g., facial warping, expression manipulation), which fixed policies cannot\nfully simulate. To address this, we propose CRDA (Curriculum\nReinforcement-Learning Data Augmentation), a novel framework guiding detectors\nto progressively master multi-domain forgery features from simple to complex.\nCRDA synthesizes augmented samples via a configurable pool of forgery\noperations and dynamically generates adversarial samples tailored to the\ndetector's current learning state. Central to our approach is integrating\nreinforcement learning (RL) and causal inference. An RL agent dynamically\nselects augmentation actions based on detector performance to efficiently\nexplore the vast augmentation space, adapting to increasingly challenging\nforgeries. Simultaneously, the agent introduces action space variations to\ngenerate heterogeneous forgery patterns, guided by causal inference to mitigate\nspurious correlations-suppressing task-irrelevant biases and focusing on\ncausally invariant features. This integration ensures robust generalization by\ndecoupling synthetic augmentation patterns from the model's learned\nrepresentations.

This paper investigates a novel and\npractical adversarial threat scenario: attacking downstream models or MLLMs\nfine-tuned from open-source VFMs, without requiring access to the victim task,\ntraining data, model query, and architecture. In contrast to conventional\ntransfer-based attacks that rely on task-aligned surrogate models, we\ndemonstrate that adversarial vulnerabilities can be exploited directly from the\nVFMs. To this end, we propose the Transferable Video Attack (TVA), a\ntemporal-aware adversarial attack method that leverages the temporal\nrepresentation dynamics of VFMs to craft effective perturbations. TVA\nintegrates a bidirectional contrastive learning mechanism to maximize the\ndiscrepancy between the clean and adversarial features, and introduces a\ntemporal consistency loss that exploits motion cues to enhance the sequential\nimpact of perturbations. TVA avoids the need to train expensive surrogate\nmodels or access to domain-specific data, thereby offering a more practical and\nefficient attack strategy.

Conventional defense\nmechanisms struggle to address the evolving landscape of multifaceted attack\npatterns. Through systematic analysis of existing defenses, we identify that\ntheir unsatisfactory performance primarily originates from an entangled feature\nspace, where adversarial attacks can be performed easily. To this end, we\npresent 3D-ANC, a novel approach that capitalizes on the Neural Collapse (NC)\nmechanism to orchestrate discriminative feature learning. In particular, NC\ndepicts where last-layer features and classifier weights jointly evolve into a\nsimplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) arrangement, establishing maximally\nseparable class prototypes. However, leveraging this advantage in 3D\nrecognition confronts two substantial challenges: (1) prevalent class imbalance\nin point cloud datasets, and (2) complex geometric similarities between object\ncategories. To tackle these obstacles, our solution combines an ETF-aligned\nclassification module with an adaptive training framework consisting of\nrepresentation-balanced learning (RBL) and dynamic feature direction loss\n(FDL). 3D-ANC seamlessly empowers existing models to develop disentangled\nfeature spaces despite the complexity in 3D data distribution.

Existing certified defenses\nlimit point-wise perturbations but overlook subtle geometric distortions that\npreserve individual points yet alter the overall structure, potentially leading\nto misclassification. In this work, we propose FreqCert, a novel certification\nframework that departs from conventional spatial domain defenses by shifting\nrobustness analysis to the frequency domain, enabling structured certification\nagainst global L2-bounded perturbations. FreqCert first transforms the input\npoint cloud via the graph Fourier transform (GFT), then applies structured\nfrequency-aware subsampling to generate multiple sub-point clouds. Each\nsub-cloud is independently classified by a standard model, and the final\nprediction is obtained through majority voting, where sub-clouds are\nconstructed based on spectral similarity rather than spatial proximity, making\nthe partitioning more stable under L2 perturbations and better aligned with the\nobject's intrinsic structure. We derive a closed-form lower bound on the\ncertified L2 robustness radius and prove its tightness under minimal and\ninterpretable assumptions, establishing a theoretical foundation for frequency\ndomain certification. Extensive experiments on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN\ndatasets demonstrate that FreqCert consistently achieves higher certified\naccuracy and empirical accuracy under strong perturbations.

This paper presents Raspi$^2$USBL, an open-source,\nRaspberry Pi-based passive inverted ultra-short baseline (piUSBL) positioning\nsystem designed to provide a low-cost and accessible solution for underwater\nrobotic research. The system comprises a passive acoustic receiver and an\nactive beacon. The receiver adopts a modular hardware architecture that\nintegrates a hydrophone array, a multichannel preamplifier, an oven-controlled\ncrystal oscillator (OCXO), a Raspberry Pi 5, and an MCC-series data acquisition\n(DAQ) board. Apart from the Pi 5, OCXO, and MCC board, the beacon comprises an\nimpedance-matching network, a power amplifier, and a transmitting transducer.\nAn open-source C++ software framework provides high-precision clock\nsynchronization and triggering for one-way travel-time (OWTT) messaging, while\nperforming real-time signal processing, including matched filtering, array\nbeamforming, and adaptive gain control, to estimate the time of flight (TOF)\nand direction of arrival (DOA) of received signals. The Raspi$^2$USBL system\nwas experimentally validated in an anechoic tank, freshwater lake, and open-sea\ntrials. Results demonstrate a slant-range accuracy better than 0.1%, a bearing\naccuracy within 0.1$^\\circ$, and stable performance over operational distances\nup to 1.3 km. These findings confirm that low-cost, reproducible hardware can\ndeliver research-grade underwater positioning accuracy. By releasing both the\nhardware and software as open-source, Raspi$^2$USBL provides a unified\nreference platform that lowers the entry barrier for underwater robotics\nlaboratories, fosters reproducibility, and promotes collaborative innovation in\nunderwater acoustic navigation and swarm robotics.",

This paper investigates how visual SLAM\ncan be integrated into consumer-grade vehicle localization systems to improve\nperformance. We propose a framework that fuses visual SLAM with a lateral\nvehicle dynamics model to achieve online gyroscope calibration under realistic\ndriving conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that vision-based\nintegration significantly improves gyroscope calibration accuracy and thus\nenhances overall localization performance, highlighting a promising path toward\nhigher automotive localization accuracy.

However,\nexisting methods face two key limitations. Firstly, they often over-rely on\nhigh-certainty keywords that explicitly identify the target object while\nneglecting critical spatial descriptions. Secondly, generalized textual\nfeatures contain both 2D and 3D descriptive information, thereby capturing an\nadditional dimension of details compared to singular 2D or 3D visual features.\nThis characteristic leads to cross-dimensional interference when refining\nvisual features under text guidance. To overcome these challenges, we propose\nMono3DVG-EnSD, a novel framework that integrates two key components: the\nCLIP-Guided Lexical Certainty Adapter (CLIP-LCA) and the Dimension-Decoupled\nModule (D2M). The CLIP-LCA dynamically masks high-certainty keywords while\nretaining low-certainty implicit spatial descriptions, thereby forcing the\nmodel to develop a deeper understanding of spatial relationships in captions\nfor object localization. Meanwhile, the D2M decouples dimension-specific\n(2D/3D) textual features from generalized textual features to guide\ncorresponding visual features at same dimension, which mitigates\ncross-dimensional interference by ensuring dimensionally-consistent cross-modal\ninteractions. Through comprehensive comparisons and ablation studies on the\nMono3DRefer dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance\nacross all metrics.

In this\nexperiment, we classify colorless microplastic particles (50-300 $\\mu$m) by\nilluminating them with linearly polarized laser light and capturing their\nreflected signals using a polarization-sensitive camera. This reflection-based\ntechnique successfully circumvents the transmission-based interference issues\nthat plague many conventional methods when applied in water. Using a deep\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) for image-based classification, we\nsuccessfully identified three common polymer types, high-density polyethylene,\nlow-density polyethylene, and polypropylene, achieving a peak mean\nclassification accuracy of 80% on the test dataset. A subsequent feature\nhierarchy analysis demonstrated that the CNN's decision-making process relies\nmainly on the microstructural integrity and internal texture (polarization\npatterns) of the particle rather than its macroshape. Critically, we found that\nthe Angle of Linear Polarization (AOLP) signal is significantly more robust\nagainst contextual noise than the Degree of Linear Polarization (DOLP) signal.\nWhile the AOLP-based classification achieved superior overall performance, its\nstrength lies in distinguishing between the two polyethylene plastics, showing\na lower confusion rate between high-density and low-density polyethylene.\nConversely, the DOLP signal demonstrated slightly worse overall classification\nresults but excels at accurately identifying the polypropylene class, which it\nisolated with greater success than AOLP.",

While truncated diffusion probabilistic models (TDPMs) hold strong\npotential with a paradigm optimization, existing TDPMs suffer from entangled\naccuracy and diversity of predictions with insufficient fidelity and\nplausibility. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose\nAmbiguity-aware Truncated Flow Matching (ATFM), which introduces a novel\ninference paradigm and dedicated model components. Firstly, we propose\nData-Hierarchical Inference, a redefinition of AMIS-specific inference\nparadigm, which enhances accuracy and diversity at data-distribution and\ndata-sample level, respectively, for an effective disentanglement. Secondly,\nGaussian Truncation Representation (GTR) is introduced to enhance both fidelity\nof predictions and reliability of truncation distribution, by explicitly\nmodeling it as a Gaussian distribution at $T_{\\text{trunc}}$ instead of using\nsampling-based approximations.Thirdly, Segmentation Flow Matching (SFM) is\nproposed to enhance the plausibility of diverse predictions by extending\nsemantic-aware flow transformation in Flow Matching (FM).

Recently, denoisers\ninduced by generative priors have been successfully integrated into regularized\noptimization methods for image restoration under Gaussian noise. However, their\napplication to non-Gaussian noise--such as impulse noise--remains largely\nunexplored. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play image restoration\nframework based on generative diffusion priors for robust removal of general\nnoise types, including impulse noise. Within the maximum a posteriori (MAP)\nestimation framework, the data fidelity term is adapted to the specific noise\nmodel. Departing from the conventional least-squares loss used for Gaussian\nnoise, we introduce a generalized Gaussian scale mixture-based loss, which\napproximates a wide range of noise distributions and leads to an $\\ell_q$-norm\n($0<q\\leq2$) fidelity term. This optimization problem is addressed using an\niteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach, wherein the proximal step\ninvolving the generative prior is efficiently performed via a diffusion-based\ndenoiser. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed method effectively removes non-Gaussian impulse noise and achieves\nsuperior restoration performance.",

Yet, dense disparity\nsupervision is nearly impossible due to anatomical constraints, typically\nlimiting annotations to only a few image-level labels acquired before the\nendoscope enters deep body cavities. Teacher-Student Learning (TSL) offers a\npromising solution by leveraging a teacher trained on sparse labels to generate\npseudo labels and associated confidence maps from abundant unlabeled surgical\nvideos. However, existing TSL methods are confined to image-level supervision,\nproviding only spatial confidence and lacking temporal consistency estimation.\nThis absence of spatio-temporal reliability results in unstable disparity\npredictions and severe flickering artifacts across video frames. To overcome\nthese challenges, we propose TiS-TSL, a novel time-switchable teacher-student\nlearning framework for video stereo matching under minimal supervision. At its\ncore is a unified model that operates in three distinct modes: Image-Prediction\n(IP), Forward Video-Prediction (FVP), and Backward Video-Prediction (BVP),\nenabling flexible temporal modeling within a single architecture. Enabled by\nthis unified model, TiS-TSL adopts a two-stage learning strategy. The\nImage-to-Video (I2V) stage transfers sparse image-level knowledge to initialize\ntemporal modeling. The subsequent Video-to-Video (V2V) stage refines temporal\ndisparity predictions by comparing forward and backward predictions to\ncalculate bidirectional spatio-temporal consistency. This consistency\nidentifies unreliable regions across frames, filters noisy video-level pseudo\nlabels, and enforces temporal coherence. Experimental results on two public\ndatasets demonstrate that TiS-TSL exceeds other image-based state-of-the-arts\nby improving TEPE and EPE by at least 2.11% and 4.54%, respectively..",

Traditional navigation\nsystems rely on expensive LiDARs that, while geometrically precise, are seman-\ntically unaware, they cannot distinguish a important document on an office\nfloor from a harmless piece of litter, treating both as physically traversable.\nWhile advanced semantic segmentation exists, no prior work has successfully\nintegrated this visual intelligence into a real-time path planner that is\nefficient enough for low-cost, embedded hardware. This paper presents a frame-\nwork to bridge this gap, delivering context-aware navigation on an affordable\nrobotic platform. Our approach centers on a novel, tight integration of a\nlightweight perception module with an online A* planner. The perception system\nemploys a semantic segmentation model to identify user-defined visual\nconstraints, enabling the robot to navigate based on contextual importance\nrather than physical size alone. This adaptability allows an operator to define\nwhat is critical for a given task, be it sensitive papers in an office or\nsafety lines in a factory, thus resolving the ambiguity of what to avoid. This\nsemantic perception is seamlessly fused with geometric data. The identified\nvisual constraints are projected as non-geometric obstacles onto a global map\nthat is continuously updated from sensor data, enabling robust navigation\nthrough both partially known and unknown environments. We validate our\nframework through extensive experiments in high-fidelity simulations and on a\nreal-world robotic platform. The results demonstrate robust, real-time\nperformance, proving that a cost- effective robot can safely navigate complex\nenvironments while respecting critical visual cues invisible to traditional\nplanners.",

Third, the \\emph{Human-Level Actuation\nScore (HLAS)} aggregates six physically grounded factors: workspace coverage\n(ROM and DoF), HEE coverage, torque-mode bandwidth, efficiency, and thermal\nsustainability. We provide detailed measurement protocols using dynamometry,\nelectrical power monitoring, and thermal testing that yield every HLAS input\nfrom reproducible experiments.

Unlike prior datasets, LIBERO+ provides object-centric\nannotations that enrich demonstrations with box- and mask-level labels as well\nas instance-level temporal tracking, supporting compact and interpretable\nvisuomotor representations. Second, we propose SlotVLA, a slot-attention-based\nframework that captures both objects and their relations for action decoding.\nIt uses a slot-based visual tokenizer to maintain consistent temporal object\nrepresentations, a relation-centric decoder to produce task-relevant\nembeddings, and an LLM-driven module that translates these embeddings into\nexecutable actions. Experiments on LIBERO+ demonstrate that object-centric slot\nand object-relation slot representations drastically reduce the number of\nrequired visual tokens, while providing competitive generalization. Together,\nLIBERO+ and SlotVLA provide a compact, interpretable, and effective foundation\nfor advancing object-relation-centric robotic manipulation.",

However, current approaches for robot relative\nlocalization are primarily realized in the form of distributed multi-robot SLAM\nsystems with the same sensor configuration, which are tightly coupled with the\nstate estimation of all robots, limiting both flexibility and accuracy. To this\nend, we fully leverage the high capacity of Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to\nintegrate multiple sensors, enabling a semi-distributed cross-modal air-ground\nrelative localization framework. In this work, both the UGV and the Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV) independently perform SLAM while extracting deep\nlearning-based keypoints and global descriptors, which decouples the relative\nlocalization from the state estimation of all agents. The UGV employs a local\nBundle Adjustment (BA) with LiDAR, camera, and an IMU to rapidly obtain\naccurate relative pose estimates. The BA process adopts sparse keypoint\noptimization and is divided into two stages: First, optimizing camera poses\ninterpolated from LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), followed by estimating the\nrelative camera poses between the UGV and UAV. Additionally, we implement an\nincremental loop closure detection algorithm using deep learning-based\ndescriptors to maintain and retrieve keyframes efficiently. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding performance in both\naccuracy and efficiency. Unlike traditional multi-robot SLAM approaches that\ntransmit images or point clouds, our method only transmits keypoint pixels and\ntheir descriptors, effectively constraining the communication bandwidth under\n0.3 Mbps.

While\nexisting PnP methods have achieved notable success in inverse problems with\nsmooth squared $\\ell_2$ data fidelity--typically associated with Gaussian\nnoise--their applicability to more general data fidelity terms remains\nunderexplored. To address this, we propose a general and efficient PnP\nalgorithm inspired by the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method.

In particular, it supports both $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$\nnorm-based losses, enabling robustness to non-Gaussian noise types such as\nPoisson and impulse noise. We validate our method on several image restoration\ntasks, including denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting, and\ndemonstrate that $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ fidelity terms outperform the\nconventional squared $\\ell_2$ loss in the presence of non-Gaussian noise.",

To address these limitations, AvatarTex\nintroduces a novel three-stage diffusion-to-GAN pipeline.

However, most existing methods compress images into 2-D\nlatent spaces via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Swin Transformers,\nwhich tend to retain substantial spatial redundancy, thereby limiting overall\ncompression performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Mixed\nRWKV-Transformer (MRT) architecture that encodes images into more compact 1-D\nlatent representations by synergistically integrating the complementary\nstrengths of linear-attention-based RWKV and self-attention-based Transformer\nmodels. Specifically, MRT partitions each image into fixed-size windows,\nutilizing RWKV modules to capture global dependencies across windows and\nTransformer blocks to model local redundancies within each window. The\nhierarchical attention mechanism enables more efficient and compact\nrepresentation learning in the 1-D domain. To further enhance compression\nefficiency, we introduce a dedicated RWKV Compression Model (RCM) tailored to\nthe structure characteristics of the intermediate 1-D latent features in MRT.\nExtensive experiments on standard image compression benchmarks validate the\neffectiveness of our approach.

However, existing methods typically suffer\nfrom at least one of the following limitations, hindering their practical\ndeployment: (1) lack of visual realism in generated anomalies; (2) dependence\non large amounts of real images; and (3) use of memory-intensive, heavyweight\nmodel architectures. To overcome these limitations, we propose AnoStyler, a\nlightweight yet effective method that frames zero-shot anomaly generation as\ntext-guided style transfer. Given a single normal image along with its category\nlabel and expected defect type, an anomaly mask indicating the localized\nanomaly regions and two-class text prompts representing the normal and anomaly\nstates are generated using generalizable category-agnostic procedures. A\nlightweight U-Net model trained with CLIP-based loss functions is used to\nstylize the normal image into a visually realistic anomaly image, where\nanomalies are localized by the anomaly mask and semantically aligned with the\ntext prompts. Extensive experiments on the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets show that\nAnoStyler outperforms existing anomaly generation methods in generating\nhigh-quality and diverse anomaly images. Furthermore, using these generated\nanomalies helps enhance anomaly detection performance.",

In\ncontrast, soft robotic simulation frameworks remain scarce and are seldom\nadopted by the soft robotics community. This gap stems partly from the lack of\neasy-to-use, general-purpose frameworks and partly from the high computational\ncost of accurately simulating continuum mechanics, which often renders policy\nlearning infeasible. In this work, we demonstrate that rapid soft robot policy\nlearning is indeed achievable via implicit time-stepping. Our simulator of\nchoice, DisMech, is a general-purpose, fully implicit soft-body simulator\ncapable of handling both soft dynamics and frictional contact. We further\nintroduce delta natural curvature control, a method analogous to delta joint\nposition control in rigid manipulators, providing an intuitive and effective\nmeans of enacting control for soft robot learning. To highlight the benefits of\nimplicit time-stepping and delta curvature control, we conduct extensive\ncomparisons across four diverse soft manipulator tasks against one of the most\nwidely used soft-body frameworks, Elastica. With implicit time-stepping,\nparallel stepping of 500 environments achieves up to 6x faster speeds for\nnon-contact cases and up to 40x faster for contact-rich scenarios. Finally, a\ncomprehensive sim-to-sim gap evaluation--training policies in one simulator and\nevaluating them in another--demonstrates that implicit time-stepping provides a\nrare free lunch: dramatic speedups achieved without sacrificing accuracy.",

While recent\napproaches leverage a limited amount of labeled target-domain data to improve\nperformance, the severe imbalance between abundant source data and scarce\ntarget data remains a critical challenge for effective representation learning.\nWe present the first frequency-space perspective to analyze this issue and\nidentify two key challenges: (1) models are easily biased toward\nsource-specific knowledge encoded in the low-frequency components of source\ndata, and (2) the sparsity of target data hinders the learning of\nhigh-frequency, domain-generalizable features. To address these challenges, we\npropose \\textbf{FreqGRL}, a novel CD-FSL framework that mitigates the impact of\ndata imbalance in the frequency space. Specifically, we introduce a\nLow-Frequency Replacement (LFR) module that substitutes the low-frequency\ncomponents of source tasks with those from the target domain to create new\nsource tasks that better align with target characteristics, thus reducing\nsource-specific biases and promoting generalizable representation learning. We\nfurther design a High-Frequency Enhancement (HFE) module that filters out\nlow-frequency components and performs learning directly on high-frequency\nfeatures in the frequency space to improve cross-domain generalization.\nAdditionally, a Global Frequency Filter (GFF) is incorporated to suppress noisy\nor irrelevant frequencies and emphasize informative ones, mitigating\noverfitting risks under limited target supervision. Extensive experiments on\nfive standard CD-FSL benchmarks demonstrate that our frequency-guided framework\nachieves state-of-the-art performance.",

Existing methods typically treat\nanomaly detection and classification as separate tasks, thereby neglecting\ntheir inherent correlation, limiting information sharing, and resulting in\nsuboptimal performance. To address this, we propose UniADC, a unified anomaly\ndetection and classification model that can effectively perform both tasks with\nonly a few or even no anomaly images. Specifically, UniADC consists of two key\ncomponents: a training-free controllable inpainting network and a multi-task\ndiscriminator. The inpainting network can synthesize anomaly images of specific\ncategories by repainting normal regions guided by anomaly priors, and can also\nrepaint few-shot anomaly samples to augment the available anomaly data. The\nmulti-task discriminator is then trained on these synthesized samples, enabling\nprecise anomaly detection and classification by aligning fine-grained image\nfeatures with anomaly-category embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on\nthree anomaly detection and classification datasets, including MVTec-FS, MTD,\nand WFDD, and the results demonstrate that UniADC consistently outperforms\nexisting methods in anomaly detection, localization, and classification.

However, most existing approaches treat these\ndomains as independent tasks, overlooking their physiological interplay and\nshared imaging biomarkers. We propose an Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning\nFramework that enables interpretable cardiopulmonary risk assessment from a\nsingle LDCT scan. The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that\nemulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then\nreasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a\ncardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three\nsynergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung\nabnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their\ncardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes\nstructural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic\ncardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically\ngrounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed\nframework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality\nprediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines.\nBeyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning\nthat aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between\npulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms.

To achieve this, a pervasive paradigm is to leverage the rich\nvision-semantic priors of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, the\nfundamental question persists: How do VLAs effectively inherit the prior\nknowledge from VLMs? To address this critical question, we introduce a\ndiagnostic benchmark, GrinningFace, an emoji tabletop manipulation task where\nthe robot arm is asked to place objects onto printed emojis corresponding to\nlanguage instructions. This task design is particularly revealing -- knowledge\nassociated with emojis is ubiquitous in Internet-scale datasets used for VLM\npre-training, yet emojis themselves are largely absent from standard robotics\ndatasets. Consequently, they provide a clean proxy: successful task completion\nindicates effective transfer of VLM priors to embodied control. We implement\nthis diagnostic task in both simulated environment and a real robot, and\ncompare various promising techniques for knowledge transfer. Specifically, we\ninvestigate the effects of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, VLM freezing,\nco-training, predicting discretized actions, and predicting latent actions.\nThrough systematic evaluation, our work not only demonstrates the critical\nimportance of preserving VLM priors for the generalization of VLA but also\nestablishes guidelines for future research in developing truly generalizable\nembodied AI systems.",
