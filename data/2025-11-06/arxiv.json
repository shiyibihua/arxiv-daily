      "summary": "Humanoid robots are expected to operate in human-centered environments where\nsafe and natural physical interaction is essential. However, most recent\nreinforcement learning (RL) policies emphasize rigid tracking and suppress\nexternal forces. Existing impedance-augmented approaches are typically\nrestricted to base or end-effector control and focus on resisting extreme\nforces rather than enabling compliance. We introduce GentleHumanoid, a\nframework that integrates impedance control into a whole-body motion tracking\npolicy to achieve upper-body compliance. At its core is a unified spring-based\nformulation that models both resistive contacts (restoring forces when pressing\nagainst surfaces) and guiding contacts (pushes or pulls sampled from human\nmotion data). This formulation ensures kinematically consistent forces across\nthe shoulder, elbow, and wrist, while exposing the policy to diverse\ninteraction scenarios. Safety is further supported through task-adjustable\nforce thresholds. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and on the\nUnitree G1 humanoid across tasks requiring different levels of compliance,\nincluding gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and safe object\nmanipulation. Compared to baselines, our policy consistently reduces peak\ncontact forces while maintaining task success, resulting in smoother and more\nnatural interactions. These results highlight a step toward humanoid robots\nthat can safely and effectively collaborate with humans and handle objects in\nreal-world environments."

Despite these low-level differences,\nhuman demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and\ninteract with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion\nprocess: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade\nwhile high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a\nprincipled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages\nhuman data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first\ntrains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or\nrobot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after\nadding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.\nActions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low\nnoise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at\nhigher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under\nexecution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion\nconsistently improves it.

We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond\nlinguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen),\nstreaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences),\nimplicit 3D spatial cognition (inferring the world behind pixels), and\npredictive world modeling (creating internal models that filter and organize\ninformation). Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering\nnarrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that\nrequire true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we\npresent VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial\nrecall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require\narbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context\nexpansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training\nCambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without\nsacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited,\nindicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We\npropose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in\nwhich a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise\n(prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this\napproach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that\nspatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate,\nselect, and organize experience."

We propose a unified shared autonomy framework that integrates\nhuman input and autonomous planners at a higher level of abstraction.

A human-subject\nsurvey further shows strong alignment, with participants agreeing with\narbitration outcomes in 92% of cases. Finally, evaluation on the Bench2Drive\nbenchmark demonstrates a substantial reduction in collision rate and\nimprovement in overall performance compared to pure autonomy.

We adopt a diagnostic\nprinciple for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.\nDesigners should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using\ndiagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate\nnon-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test\nset'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.\n  We operationalize this standard with two components.

We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based\ndiagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.\nSecond, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an\n``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four\nbenchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive\nnon-visual biases.

      "summary": "\"Thinking with Text\" and \"Thinking with Images\" paradigm significantly\nimprove the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) and Vision\nLanguage Models (VLMs). However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1)\nImages capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or\ncontinuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct\nmodalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To\novercome these limitations, we introduce \"Thinking with Video\", a new paradigm\nthat leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and\ntextual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration,\nwe developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench\nencompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing\nPuzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our\nevaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks,\nSora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even\nsurpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric\ntasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU.\nFurthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also\nfind that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's\nperformance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation\nmodel is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model,\npositions \"thinking with video\" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm."

We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft\nlocalization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:\nEvaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy\nof 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by\nover 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision\nfor surgical complexity assessment.

Concretely, we\nminimize the change in the layer's output distribution, which can be expressed\nas $\\lVert (W - \\widetilde{W}) \\Sigma^{1/2}\\rVert_F$ where $\\Sigma^{1/2}$ is\nthe square root of the covariance matrix of the layer's input and $W$,\n$\\widetilde{W}$ are the original and compressed weights.

Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated\ndatasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised\nAI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative\nbaseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained\nYOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate\nthe initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data\nfor the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by\nproviding a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further\nmanual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal\nconsistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively\nevaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of\nground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,\nand test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory\nperformance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted\napproach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods\nof complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually\nprompted model fails.

Existing solutions often apply\nend-to-end imitation learning with Vision-Language Action (VLA) models or\nsymbolic approaches with Action Model Learning (AML). On the one hand, current\nVLA models are limited by the lack of high-level symbolic planning, which\nhinders their abilities in long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, symbolic\napproaches in AML lack generalization and scalability perspectives. In this\npaper we present a new neuro-symbolic approach, GraSP-VLA, a framework that\nuses a Continuous Scene Graph representation to generate a symbolic\nrepresentation of human demonstrations. This representation is used to generate\nnew planning domains during inference and serves as an orchestrator for\nlow-level VLA policies, scaling up the number of actions that can be reproduced\nin a row. Our results show that GraSP-VLA is effective for modeling symbolic\nrepresentations on the task of automatic planning domain generation from\nobservations.

However, efficiently\nextracting and analyzing this spatial information for exploratory and\npredictive purposes remains a challenge, especially when using traditional\nchemometric methods.

Accurate\nregistration of images from different modalities is an essential step in\ndigital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color\ntransformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and\neosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset\nof 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing\nsteps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,\nVahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and\ndenoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,\nwhich first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration\nin two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance\nwas evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported\nthe median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values\n(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based\nevaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done\nseparately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal\nimages. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest\nregistration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors.

To address this challenge, we propose an efficient\nDual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the\nframework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an\nobject detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated\nbranch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible\nColumnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to\nleverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,\na lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to\ncapture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.\nAnother branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by\nconstructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation\nwithin the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.\nFinally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines\nmotion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,\nocclusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset\ndemonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Our\nerror-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust\nto approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers\nfail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the\ncomputation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with\nthe tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the\nadditional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.\nWe also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively\nselects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large\nextrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up\nto 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\\Delta$ImageReward\n$\\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free\naccelerators under identical computation budgets.

While Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area\nsearch and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a\nsignificant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine\ncollaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an\nerror-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a\nlow-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap,\nthis study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed\nframework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and\nmulti-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations. It\nthen employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension,\nhierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm. This\nclosed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner,\nproviding active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual\nmonitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR\ntask.

      "summary": "Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, which measure changes in blood volume in\nthe skin using light, have recently gained attention in biometric\nauthentication because of their non-invasive acquisition, inherent liveness\ndetection, and suitability for low-cost wearable devices. However, PPG signal\nquality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and\ninter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and\nclassification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective\nbiometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from\nlow-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings\nfrom 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The\nraw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline\ndrift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude\nnormalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG\nsegment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the\nContinuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient\ncardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed\nCVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision\nTransformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long\nShort-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects\ndemonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the\nmodel to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency,\nscalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is\nwell-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications."

Beyond\nrepresentation, we design a dual-mode autoencoder for Faithful Contouring,\nenabling scalable and detail-preserving shape reconstruction. Extensive\nexperiments show that Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in\naccuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction. For direct\nrepresentation, it achieves distance errors at the $10^{-5}$ level; for mesh\nreconstruction, it yields a 93\\% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a 35\\%\nimprovement in F-score over strong baselines, confirming superior fidelity as a\nrepresentation for 3D learning tasks."

We validate our model's\neffectiveness by fine-tuning it on a diverse set of downstream diagnostic\ntasks. Comprehensive experiments empirically demonstrate that MedDChest\nsignificantly outperforms strong, publicly available ImageNet-pretrained\nmodels.

Yet,\nthe computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and\nsocial interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI\nvision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose\ninformation to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI\nvision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth\nestimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video\nclips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict\nhuman social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,\n3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that\nkey social information is available in explicit body position but not in the\nlearned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise\nembeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the\ncritical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a\ncompact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and\ndirection of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors\nmatched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly\nimproved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with\ntheir embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were\nrepresented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability\nto match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence\nthat human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D\npose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives."

We argue that these scene elements\nshould be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,\nrepetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this\nwork, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates\nprogress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated\npointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing\nthe first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the\nstructural layout.
