However, most recent\nreinforcement learning (RL) policies emphasize rigid tracking and suppress\nexternal forces. Existing impedance-augmented approaches are typically\nrestricted to base or end-effector control and focus on resisting extreme\nforces rather than enabling compliance. We introduce GentleHumanoid, a\nframework that integrates impedance control into a whole-body motion tracking\npolicy to achieve upper-body compliance. At its core is a unified spring-based\nformulation that models both resistive contacts (restoring forces when pressing\nagainst surfaces) and guiding contacts (pushes or pulls sampled from human\nmotion data). This formulation ensures kinematically consistent forces across\nthe shoulder, elbow, and wrist, while exposing the policy to diverse\ninteraction scenarios. Safety is further supported through task-adjustable\nforce thresholds. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and on the\nUnitree G1 humanoid across tasks requiring different levels of compliance,\nincluding gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and safe object\nmanipulation. Compared to baselines, our policy consistently reduces peak\ncontact forces while maintaining task success, resulting in smoother and more\nnatural interactions. These results highlight a step toward humanoid robots\nthat can safely and effectively collaborate with humans and handle objects in\nreal-world environments.",

However, humans and robots differ\nfundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct\nkinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that\nare physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,\nhuman demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and\ninteract with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion\nprocess: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade\nwhile high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a\nprincipled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages\nhuman data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first\ntrains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or\nrobot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after\nadding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.\nActions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low\nnoise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at\nhigher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under\nexecution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion\nconsistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves\na 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website\nis available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Diffusion/.",

We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond\nlinguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen),\nstreaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences),\nimplicit 3D spatial cognition (inferring the world behind pixels), and\npredictive world modeling (creating internal models that filter and organize\ninformation). Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering\nnarrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that\nrequire true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we\npresent VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial\nrecall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require\narbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context\nexpansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training\nCambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without\nsacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited,\nindicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We\npropose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in\nwhich a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise\n(prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this\napproach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that\nspatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate,\nselect, and organize experience.",

Shared autonomy has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate such\nfailures by incorporating human input when autonomy is uncertain.

We propose a unified shared autonomy framework that integrates\nhuman input and autonomous planners at a higher level of abstraction. Our\nmethod leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to infer driver intent from\nmulti-modal cues -- such as driver actions and environmental context -- and to\nsynthesize coherent strategies that mediate between human and autonomous\ncontrol. We first study the framework in a mock-human setting, where it\nachieves perfect recall alongside high accuracy and precision. A human-subject\nsurvey further shows strong alignment, with participants agreeing with\narbitration outcomes in 92% of cases.

Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without\nstrong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and\nsuperficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric\nbenchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic\nprinciple for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.\nDesigners should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using\ndiagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate\nnon-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test\nset'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.\n  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose\nbenchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.\nOur primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language\nModel via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual\ninputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a\nbias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based\ndiagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.\nSecond, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an\n``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four\nbenchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive\nnon-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create\nVSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider\nvision-blind performance gap than the original.",

Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual\ndescriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language\nalignment.

We also\nfind that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's\nperformance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation\nmodel is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model,\npositions \"thinking with video\" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.",

However, current VLA models typically\ncontain massive parameters and rely heavily on large-scale robot data\npretraining, leading to high computational costs during training, as well as\nlimited deployability for real-time inference. Moreover, most training\nparadigms often degrade the perceptual representations of the vision-language\nbackbone, resulting in overfitting and poor generalization to downstream tasks.\nIn this work, we present Evo-1, a lightweight VLA model that reduces\ncomputation and improves deployment efficiency, while maintaining strong\nperformance without pretraining on robot data. Evo-1 builds on a native\nmultimodal Vision-Language model (VLM), incorporating a novel cross-modulated\ndiffusion transformer along with an optimized integration module, together\nforming an effective architecture. We further introduce a two-stage training\nparadigm that progressively aligns action with perception, preserving the\nrepresentations of the VLM. Notably, with only 0.77 billion parameters, Evo-1\nachieves state-of-the-art results on the Meta-World and RoboTwin suite,\nsurpassing the previous best models by 12.4% and 6.9%, respectively, and also\nattains a competitive result of 94.8% on LIBERO.

The\nParkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for\nstratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos\nremains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete\nvideos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work,\nwe introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity\nestimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal\nsupervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed\nclips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal\nlocalization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading\nmodule. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft\nlocalization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:\nEvaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy\nof 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by\nover 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision\nfor surgical complexity assessment.

Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated\ndatasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised\nAI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative\nbaseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained\nYOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate\nthe initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data\nfor the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by\nproviding a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further\nmanual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal\nconsistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively\nevaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of\nground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,\nand test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory\nperformance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted\napproach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods\nof complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually\nprompted model fails. By reducing the need for manual analysis in real-world\nscenarios, this work provides a practical tool that paves the way for more\nefficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods.",

By modeling multi-step action chunks rather than single-step actions,\naction chunking significantly enhances modeling capabilities for human expert\npolicies. However, the reduced decision frequency restricts the utilization of\nrecent observations, degrading reactivity - particularly evident in the\ninadequate adaptation to sensor noise and dynamic environmental changes.\nExisting efforts to address this issue have primarily resorted to trading off\nreactivity against decision consistency, without achieving both. To address\nthis limitation, we propose a novel algorithm, Temporal Action Selector (TAS),\nwhich caches predicted action chunks from multiple timesteps and dynamically\nselects the optimal action through a lightweight selector network. TAS achieves\nbalanced optimization across three critical dimensions: reactivity, decision\nconsistency, and motion coherence. Experiments across multiple tasks with\ndiverse base policies show that TAS significantly improves success rates -\nyielding an absolute gain of up to 73.3%. Furthermore, integrating TAS as a\nbase policy with residual reinforcement learning (RL) substantially enhances\ntraining efficiency and elevates the performance plateau.

However, efficiently\nextracting and analyzing this spatial information for exploratory and\npredictive purposes remains a challenge, especially when using traditional\nchemometric methods. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial\nintelligence have significantly enhanced image processing capabilities,\nenabling the extraction of multiscale deep features that are otherwise\nchallenging to capture with conventional image processing techniques. Despite\nthe wide availability of open-source deep learning models, adoption in\nanalytical chemistry remains limited because of the absence of structured,\nstep-by-step guidance for implementing these models.\n  Results This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a step-by-step\nguide for applying deep learning approaches to extract spatial information from\nimaging data and integrating it with other data sources, such as spectral\ninformation. Importantly, the focus of this work is not on training deep\nlearning models for image processing but on using existing open source models\nto extract deep features from imaging data.\n  Significance The tutorial provides MATLAB code tutorial demonstrations,\nshowcasing the processing of imaging data from various imaging modalities\ncommonly encountered in analytical chemistry. Readers must run the tutorial\nsteps on their own datasets using the codes presented in this tutorial.",

Bird's Eye View (BEV)\nrepresentations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial\nformat, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although\nBEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through\nmultimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by\nenvironmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D\ndetection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the\nimpact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)\noutputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset.\nDetection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the\nnuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera\nocclusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is\nbased only on the camera. On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance\nonly under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%),\nwith a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect\ndepends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1%\ndrop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8%\ndrop (to 50.1%), revealing the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task\nof 3D object detection.

Moreover, these text\nencoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions,\nwhich limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these\nchallenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of\nprompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless\nstep instead of two separate steps.

Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks &\nTemples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our method significantly\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods in training speed, achieving a\n3.32$\\times$ training acceleration and comparable rendering quality compared\nwith DashGaussian on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset and a 15.45$\\times$ acceleration\ncompared with vanilla 3DGS on the Deep Blending dataset. We demonstrate that\nFastGS exhibits strong generality, delivering 2-7$\\times$ training acceleration\nacross various tasks, including dynamic scene reconstruction, surface\nreconstruction, sparse-view reconstruction, large-scale reconstruction, and\nsimultaneous localization and mapping.

The Lightweight Stagnation Detection reduces\nredundant exploration through Lidar Static Anomaly Detection and Map Update\nStagnation Detection, terminating episodes on low expansion rates. Experimental\nresults show that compared with the frontier-based method and RRT method, our\napproach shortens exploration time by up to 65% and reduces path distance by up\nto 42%, significantly improving exploration efficiency in complex environments\nwhile maintaining reliable map completeness. Ablation studies confirm that the\ncollaborative mechanism accelerates training convergence. Empirical validation\non a physical robotic platform demonstrates the algorithm's practical\napplicability and its successful transferability from simulation to real-world\nenvironments.",

In digital\npathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of\ninformation from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting\napplications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate\nregistration of images from different modalities is an essential step in\ndigital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color\ntransformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and\neosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset\nof 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing\nsteps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,\nVahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and\ndenoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,\nwhich first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration\nin two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance\nwas evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported\nthe median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values\n(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based\nevaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done\nseparately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal\nimages. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest\nregistration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These\nfindings show that applying color transformation before registration improves\nalignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable\nanalysis in digital pathology.",

However, the complicated maritime environment often\ncauses camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant\nchallenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient\nDual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the\nframework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an\nobject detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated\nbranch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible\nColumnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to\nleverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,\na lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to\ncapture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.\nAnother branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by\nconstructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation\nwithin the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.\nFinally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines\nmotion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,\nocclusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset\ndemonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT\nattains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while\nmaintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.\nCode is available at:\nhttps://github.com/BiscuitsLzy/DMSORT-An-efficient-parallel-maritime-multi-object-tracking-architecture-.",

Our\nerror-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust\nto approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers\nfail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the\ncomputation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with\nthe tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the\nadditional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.\nWe also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively\nselects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large\nextrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up\nto 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\\Delta$ImageReward\n$\\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free\naccelerators under identical computation budgets.

However,\nprecise control over object localization in generated images remains a\nchallenge. Existing methods fail to fully utilize positional information,\nleading to an inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts. To address\nthis issue, we propose SpatialLock, a novel framework that leverages perception\nsignals and grounding information to jointly control the generation of spatial\nlocations. SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection\n(PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG). PoI directly integrates spatial\ninformation through an attention layer, encouraging the model to learn the\ngrounding information effectively. PoG employs perception-based supervision to\nfurther refine object localization. Together, these components enable the model\nto generate objects with precise spatial arrangements and improve the visual\nquality of the generated images. Experiments show that SpatialLock sets a new\nstate-of-the-art for precise object positioning, achieving IOU scores above 0.9\nacross multiple datasets.",

While Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area\nsearch and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a\nsignificant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine\ncollaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an\nerror-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a\nlow-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap,\nthis study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed\nframework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and\nmulti-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations. It\nthen employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension,\nhierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm. This\nclosed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner,\nproviding active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual\nmonitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR\ntask. We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario.\nExperimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and\ncommand-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task\ncompletion time by approximately $64.2\\%$ and improved task success rate by\n$7\\%$.

The\nraw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline\ndrift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude\nnormalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG\nsegment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the\nContinuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient\ncardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed\nCVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision\nTransformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long\nShort-Term Memory network (LSTM).

We pre-trained MedDChest from scratch on a massive, curated,\nmultimodal dataset of over 1.2 million images, encompassing different\nmodalities including Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) compiled from 10\npublic sources. A core technical contribution of our work is Guided Random\nResized Crops, a novel content-aware data augmentation strategy that biases\nsampling towards anatomically relevant regions, overcoming the inefficiency of\nstandard cropping techniques on medical scans. We validate our model's\neffectiveness by fine-tuning it on a diverse set of downstream diagnostic\ntasks. Comprehensive experiments empirically demonstrate that MedDChest\nsignificantly outperforms strong, publicly available ImageNet-pretrained\nmodels. By establishing the superiority of large-scale, in-domain pre-training\ncombined with domain-specific data augmentation, MedDChest provides a powerful\nand robust feature extractor that serves as a significantly better starting\npoint for a wide array of thoracic diagnostic tasks.

Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose\ninformation to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI\nvision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth\nestimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video\nclips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict\nhuman social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,\n3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that\nkey social information is available in explicit body position but not in the\nlearned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise\nembeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the\ncritical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a\ncompact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and\ndirection of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors\nmatched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly\nimproved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with\ntheir embeddings.

            "summary": "Reconstructing real-world objects from multi-view images is essential for\napplications in 3D editing, AR/VR, and digital content creation. Existing\nmethods typically prioritize either geometric accuracy (Multi-View Stereo) or\nphotorealistic rendering (Novel View Synthesis), often decoupling geometry and\nappearance optimization, which hinders downstream editing tasks. This paper\nadvocates an unified treatment on geometry and appearance optimization for\nseamless Gaussian-mesh joint optimization. More specifically, we propose a\nnovel framework that simultaneously optimizes mesh geometry (vertex positions\nand faces) and vertex colors via Gaussian-guided mesh differentiable rendering,\nleveraging photometric consistency from input images and geometric\nregularization from normal and depth maps. The obtained high-quality 3D\nreconstruction can be further exploit in down-stream editing tasks, such as\nrelighting and shape deformation. The code will be publicly available upon\nacceptance.",
