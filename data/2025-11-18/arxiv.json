      "summary": "The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is designed to promote research on abstract reasoning, a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. Common approaches to ARC treat it as a language-oriented problem, addressed by large language models (LLMs) or recurrent reasoning models. However, although the puzzle-like tasks in ARC are inherently visual, existing research has rarely approached the problem from a vision-centric perspective. In this work, we formulate ARC within a vision paradigm, framing it as an image-to-image translation problem. To incorporate visual priors, we represent the inputs on a \"canvas\" that can be processed like natural images. It is then natural for us to apply standard vision architectures, such as a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT), to perform image-to-image mapping. Our model is trained from scratch solely on ARC data and generalizes to unseen tasks through test-time training. Our framework, termed Vision ARC (VARC), achieves 60.4% accuracy on the ARC-1 benchmark, substantially outperforming existing methods that are also trained from scratch. Our results are competitive with those of leading LLMs and close the gap to average human performance."

Building upon UniGen, we comprehensively enhance the model architecture and training pipeline to strengthen the image understanding and generation capabilities while unlocking strong image editing ability. Especially, we propose a unified Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategy that improves both image generation and image editing jointly via shared reward models. To further enhance image editing performance, we propose a light Edit Instruction Alignment stage that significantly improves the editing instruction comprehension that is essential for the success of the RL training. Experimental results show that UniGen-1.5 demonstrates competitive understanding and generation performance. Specifically, UniGen-1.5 achieves 0.89 and 4.31 overall scores on GenEval and ImgEdit that surpass the state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and reaching performance comparable to proprietary models such as GPT-Image-1."

We present a general-purpose method, RL with Experience and Corrections via Advantage-conditioned Policies (RECAP), that provides for RL training of VLAs via advantage conditioning. Our method incorporates heterogeneous data into the self-improvement process, including demonstrations, data from on-policy collection, and expert teleoperated interventions provided during autonomous execution. RECAP starts by pre-training a generalist VLA with offline RL, which we call $π^{*}_{0.6}$, that can then be specialized to attain high performance on downstream tasks through on-robot data collection. We show that the $π^{*}_{0.6}$ model trained with the full RECAP method can fold laundry in real homes, reliably assemble boxes, and make espresso drinks using a professional espresso machine. On some of the hardest tasks, RECAP more than doubles task throughput and roughly halves the task failure rate."

      "summary": "Learning from real-world robot demonstrations holds promise for interacting with complex real-world environments. However, the complexity and variability of interaction dynamics often cause purely positional controllers to struggle with contacts or varying payloads. To address this, we propose a Heterogeneous Meta-Control (HMC) framework for Loco-Manipulation that adaptively stitches multiple control modalities: position, impedance, and hybrid force-position. We first introduce an interface, HMC-Controller, for blending actions from different control profiles continuously in the torque space. HMC-Controller facilitates both teleoperation and policy deployment. Then, to learn a robust force-aware policy, we propose HMC-Policy to unify different controllers into a heterogeneous architecture. We adopt a mixture-of-experts style routing to learn from large-scale position-only data and fine-grained force-aware demonstrations. Experiments on a real humanoid robot show over 50% relative improvement vs. baselines on challenging tasks such as compliant table wiping and drawer opening, demonstrating the efficacy of HMC."

      "summary": "As perception-based controllers for autonomous systems become increasingly popular in the real world, it is important that we can formally verify their safety and performance despite perceptual uncertainty. Unfortunately, the verification of such systems remains challenging, largely due to the complexity of the controllers, which are often nonlinear, nonconvex, learning-based, and/or black-box. Prior works propose verification algorithms that are based on approximate reachability methods, but they often restrict the class of controllers and systems that can be handled or result in overly conservative analyses. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a popular formal verification tool for general nonlinear systems that can compute optimal reachable sets under worst-case system uncertainties; however, its application to perception-based systems is currently underexplored. In this work, we propose RoVer-CoRe, a framework for the Robust Verification of Controllers via HJ Reachability. To the best of our knowledge, RoVer-CoRe is the first HJ reachability-based framework for the verification of perception-based systems under perceptual uncertainty. Our key insight is to concatenate the system controller, observation function, and the state estimation modules to obtain an equivalent closed-loop system that is readily compatible with existing reachability frameworks. Within RoVer-CoRe, we propose novel methods for formal safety verification and robust controller design. We demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in case studies involving aircraft taxiing and NN-based rover navigation. Code is available at the link in the footnote."

Co-Me distilled a light-weight confidence predictor to rank tokens by uncertainty and selectively merge low-confidence ones, effectively reducing computation while maintaining spatial coverage. Compared to similarity-based merging or pruning, the confidence signal in Co-Me reliably indicates regions emphasized by the transformer, enabling substantial acceleration without degrading performance. Co-Me applies seamlessly to various multi-view and streaming visual geometric transformers, achieving speedups that scale with sequence length. When applied to VGGT and MapAnything, Co-Me achieves up to $11.3\\times$ and $7.2\\times$ speedup, making visual geometric transformers practical for real-time 3D perception and reconstruction."

To overcome the challenges of subjective and noisy engagement labels, we propose a framework leveraging Vision Large Language Models (VLMs) to refine annotations and guide the training process. Our framework uses a questionnaire to extract behavioral cues and split data into high- and low-reliability subsets. We also introduce a training strategy combining curriculum learning with soft label refinement, gradually incorporating ambiguous samples while adjusting supervision to reflect uncertainty. We demonstrate that classical computer vision models trained on refined high-reliability subsets and enhanced with our curriculum strategy show improvements, highlighting benefits of addressing label subjectivity with VLMs. This method surpasses prior state of the art across engagement benchmarks such as EngageNet (three of six feature settings, maximum improvement of +1.21%), and DREAMS / PAFE with F1 gains of +0.22 / +0.06."

In fact, the intricate geometry of 3D urban environments results in high degrees of occlusion and requires extensive manual viewpoint adjustments that make large-scale exploration inefficient. To address this, we propose a view-based approach for 3D data exploration, where a vector field encodes views from the environment. To support this approach, we introduce a neural field-based method that constructs an efficient implicit representation of 3D environments. This representation enables both faster direct queries, which consist of the computation of view assessment indices, and inverse queries, which help avoid occlusion and facilitate the search for views that match desired data patterns. Our approach supports key urban analysis tasks such as visibility assessments, solar exposure evaluation, and assessing the visual impact of new developments. We validate our method through quantitative experiments, case studies informed by real-world urban challenges, and feedback from domain experts. Results show its effectiveness in finding desirable viewpoints, analyzing building facade visibility, and evaluating views from outdoor spaces.

Our realism enhancement approach is a zero-shot framework that focuses on preserving the multi-level structures from synthetic videos into the enhanced one in both spatial and temporal domains, built upon a diffusion video foundational model without further fine-tuning. Specifically, we incorporate an effective modification to have the generation/denoising process conditioned on estimated structure-aware information from the synthetic video, such as depth maps, semantic maps, and edge maps, by an auxiliary model, rather than extracting the information from a simulator. This guidance ensures that the enhanced videos are consistent with the original synthetic video at both the structural and semantic levels. Our approach is a simple yet general and powerful approach to enhancing synthetic video realism: we show that our approach outperforms existing baselines in structural consistency with the original video while maintaining state-of-the-art photorealism quality in our experiments."

      "summary": "Standard Latent Diffusion Models rely on a complex, three-part architecture consisting of a separate encoder, decoder, and diffusion network, which are trained in multiple stages. This modular design is computationally inefficient, leads to suboptimal performance, and prevents the unification of diffusion with the single-network architectures common in vision foundation models. Our goal is to unify these three components into a single, end-to-end trainable network. We first demonstrate that a naive joint training approach fails catastrophically due to ``latent collapse'', where the diffusion training objective interferes with the network's ability to learn a good latent representation. We identify the root causes of this instability by drawing a novel analogy between diffusion and self-distillation based unsupervised learning method. Based on this insight, we propose Diffusion as Self-Distillation (DSD), a new framework with key modifications to the training objective that stabilize the latent space. This approach enables, for the first time, the stable end-to-end training of a single network that simultaneously learns to encode, decode, and perform diffusion. DSD achieves outstanding performance on the ImageNet $256\\times 256$ conditional generation task: FID=13.44/6.38/4.25 with only 42M/118M/205M parameters and 50 training epochs on ImageNet, without using classifier-free-guidance."

      "summary": "The quadratic time and memory complexity of the attention mechanism in modern Transformer based video generators makes end-to-end training for ultra high resolution videos prohibitively expensive. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce a training-free approach that leverages video Diffusion Transformers pretrained at their native scale to synthesize higher resolution videos without any additional training or adaptation. At the core of our method lies an inward sliding window attention mechanism, which originates from a key observation: maintaining each query token's training scale receptive field is crucial for preserving visual fidelity and detail. However, naive local window attention, unfortunately, often leads to repetitive content and exhibits a lack of global coherence in the generated results. To overcome this challenge, we devise a dual-path pipeline that backs up window attention with a novel cross-attention override strategy, enabling the semantic content produced by local attention to be guided by another branch with a full receptive field and, therefore, ensuring holistic consistency. Furthermore, to improve efficiency, we incorporate a cross-attention caching strategy for this branch to avoid the frequent computation of full 3D attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method delivers ultra-high-resolution videos with fine-grained visual details and high efficiency in a training-free paradigm. Meanwhile, it achieves superior performance on VBench, even compared to training-based alternatives, with competitive or improved efficiency.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide complementary physiological information, as conduction abnormalities can help localize or suggest scarred myocardial regions. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal framework that integrates ECG-derived electrophysiological information with anatomical priors from the AHA-17 atlas for physiologically consistent LGE-based scar segmentation. As ECGs and LGE-MRIs are not acquired simultaneously, we introduce a Temporal Aware Feature Fusion (TAFF) mechanism that dynamically weights and fuses features based on their acquisition time difference. Our method was evaluated on a clinical dataset and achieved substantial gains over the state-of-the-art image-only baseline (nnU-Net), increasing the average Dice score for scars from 0.6149 to 0.8463 and achieving high performance in both precision (0.9115) and sensitivity (0.9043). These results show that integrating physiological and anatomical knowledge allows the model to \"see beyond the image\", setting a new direction for robust and physiologically grounded cardiac scar segmentation."

      "summary": "Seismic sensing has emerged as a promising solution for border surveillance and monitoring; the seismic sensors that are often buried underground are small and cannot be noticed easily, making them difficult for intruders to detect, avoid, or vandalize. This significantly enhances their effectiveness compared to highly visible cameras or fences. However, accurately detecting and distinguishing between overlapping activities that are happening simultaneously, such as human intrusions, animal movements, and vehicle rumbling, remains a major challenge due to the complex and noisy nature of seismic signals. Correctly identifying simultaneous activities is critical because failing to separate them can lead to misclassification, missed detections, and an incomplete understanding of the situation, thereby reducing the reliability of surveillance systems. To tackle this problem, we propose HyMAD (Hybrid Multi-Activity Detection), a deep neural architecture based on spatio-temporal feature fusion. The framework integrates spectral features extracted with SincNet and temporal dependencies modeled by a recurrent neural network (RNN). In addition, HyMAD employs self-attention layers to strengthen intra-modal representations and a cross-modal fusion module to achieve robust multi-label classification of seismic events. e evaluate our approach on a dataset constructed from real-world field recordings collected in the context of border surveillance and monitoring, demonstrating its ability to generalize to complex, simultaneous activity scenarios involving humans, animals, and vehicles. Our method achieves competitive performance and offers a modular framework for extending seismic-based activity recognition in real-world security applications."

      "summary": "Attention is the brain's ability to selectively focus on a few specific aspects while ignoring irrelevant ones. This biological principle inspired the attention mechanism in modern Transformers. Transformers now underpin large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, but at the cost of massive training and inference energy, leading to a large carbon footprint. While brain attention emerges from neural circuits, Transformer attention relies on dot-product similarity to weight elements in the input sequence. Neuromorphic computing, especially spiking neural networks (SNNs), offers a brain-inspired path to energy-efficient intelligence. Despite recent work on attention-based spiking Transformers, the core attention layer remains non-neuromorphic. Current spiking attention (i) relies on dot-product or element-wise similarity suited to floating-point operations, not event-driven spikes; (ii) keeps attention matrices that suffer from the von Neumann bottleneck, limiting in-memory computing; and (iii) still diverges from brain-like computation. To address these issues, we propose the Spiking STDP Transformer (S$^{2}$TDPT), a neuromorphic Transformer that implements self-attention through spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), embedding query--key correlations in synaptic weights. STDP, a core mechanism of memory and learning in the brain and widely studied in neuromorphic devices, naturally enables in-memory computing and supports non-von Neumann hardware. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, our model achieves 94.35\\% and 78.08\\% accuracy with only four timesteps and 0.49 mJ on CIFAR-100, an 88.47\\% energy reduction compared to a standard ANN Transformer. Grad-CAM shows that the model attends to semantically relevant regions, enhancing interpretability. Overall, S$^{2}$TDPT illustrates how biologically inspired attention can yield energy-efficient, hardware-friendly, and explainable neuromorphic models."

Both frameworks achieve optimal performance at 224x224 pixels, with an MAE of 10.83 years (DeepFace) and 7.46 years (InsightFace).

This architectural enhancement alone yields substantial performance gains, enabling NORA-1.5 to outperform NORA and several state-of-the-art VLA models across both simulated and real-world benchmarks. To further improve robustness and task success, we develop a set of reward models for post-training VLA policies. Our rewards combine (i) an action-conditioned world model (WM) that evaluates whether generated actions lead toward the desired goal, and (ii) a deviation-from-ground-truth heuristic that distinguishes good actions from poor ones. Using these reward signals, we construct preference datasets and adapt NORA-1.5 to target embodiments through direct preference optimization (DPO). Extensive evaluations show that reward-driven post-training consistently improves performance in both simulation and real-robot settings, demonstrating significant VLA model-reliability gains through simple yet effective reward models.

We present RepAir, a three-stage framework for robust 3D airway segmentation that combines an nnU-Net-based network with anatomically informed topology correction. The segmentation network produces an initial airway mask, after which a skeleton-based algorithm identifies potential discontinuities and proposes reconnections. A 1D convolutional classifier then determines which candidate links correspond to true anatomical branches versus false or obstructed paths. We evaluate RepAir on two distinct datasets: ATM'22, comprising annotated CT scans from predominantly healthy subjects and AeroPath, encompassing annotated scans with severe airway pathology. Across both datasets, RepAir outperforms existing 3D U-Net-based approaches such as Bronchinet and NaviAirway on both voxel-level and topological metrics, and produces more complete and anatomically consistent airway trees while maintaining high segmentation accuracy."

To stabilize learning, we apply Adaptive Gradient Surgery to tackle conflicting task gradients and prevent model collapse. We integrate the pretrained encoder into an attention-based Multiple Instance Learning aggregator for bag-level prediction and attention-guided retrieval of the most abnormal instances in a bag. On a publicly available bone-marrow cytology dataset, with simulated witness rates from 10% down to 0.5%, SLAM-AGS improves bag-level F1-Score and Top 400 positive cell retrieval over other pretraining methods, with the largest gains at low witness rates, showing that resolving gradient interference enables stable pretraining and better performance on downstream tasks.

However, when input views are sparse, such optimization is prone to overfitting, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality. Existing approaches address this challenge by employing flattened Gaussian primitives to better fit surface geometry, combined with depth regularization to alleviate geometric ambiguities under limited viewpoints. Nevertheless, the increased anisotropy inherent in flattened Gaussians exacerbates overfitting in sparse-view scenarios, hindering accurate surface fitting and degrading novel view synthesis performance. In this paper, we propose \\net{}, a method that reconstructs more accurate and detailed surfaces while preserving high-quality novel view rendering. Our key insight is to introduce Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment, which bridges rendering quality and geometry estimation, thereby jointly enhancing both surface reconstruction and view synthesis. In addition, we present a Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency by incorporating both training and unseen views, effectively mitigating overfitting caused by sparse supervision. Extensive experiments on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance."

It leverages voxelized LiDAR data as a lightweight and structured perceptual representation, and employs a z-grouped 2D CNN to map this representation to the control policy, enabling fully end-to-end optimization. A high-fidelity LiDAR simulation that dynamically generates realistic observations is developed to support scalable, LiDAR-based training and ensure sim-to-real consistency. Experimental results show that Gallant's broader perceptual coverage facilitates the use of a single policy that goes beyond the limitations of previous methods confined to ground-level obstacles, extending to lateral clutter, overhead constraints, multi-level structures, and narrow passages. Gallant also firstly achieves near 100% success rates in challenging scenarios such as stair climbing and stepping onto elevated platforms through improved end-to-end optimization."

Vision-based fall prediction systems offer a non-invasive solution to anticipate falls seconds before impact, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of available fall data. Contributing to these efforts, this study proposes the Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN), a dual-stream model that combines both pose and biomechanical information using a cross-attention fusion mechanism. Our model outperforms the vanilla ST-GCN baseline by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on the simulated MCF-UA stunt-actor and MUVIM datasets, respectively. The spatio-temporal attention mechanisms in the ST-GCN stream also provide interpretability by identifying critical joints and temporal phases. However, a critical simulation-reality gap persists. While our model achieves an 89.0% F1-score with full supervision on simulated data, zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects drops to 35.9%. This performance decline is likely due to biases in simulated data, such as `intent-to-fall' cues. For older adults, particularly those with diabetes or frailty, this gap is exacerbated by their unique kinematic profiles. To address this, we propose personalization strategies and advocate for privacy-preserving data pipelines to enable real-world validation. Our findings underscore the urgent need to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data to develop effective fall prediction systems for vulnerable elderly populations."

We present Holographic Tissue Expression Inpainting and Analysis (HoloTea), a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that imputes spot-level gene expression from H&E while explicitly using information from adjacent sections. Our key idea is to retrieve morphologically corresponding spots on neighboring slides in a shared feature space and fuse this cross section context into a lightweight ControlNet, allowing conditioning to follow anatomical continuity. To better capture the count nature of the data, we introduce a 3D-consistent prior for flow matching that combines a learned zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) prior with a spatial-empirical prior constructed from neighboring sections. A global attention block introduces 3D H&E scaling linearly with the number of spots in the slide, enabling training and inference on large 3D ST datasets. Across three spatial transcriptomics datasets spanning different tissue types and resolutions, HoloTea consistently improves 3D expression accuracy and generalization compared to 2D and 3D baselines. We envision HoloTea advancing the creation of accurate 3D virtual tissues, ultimately accelerating biomarker discovery and deepening our understanding of disease."

In this study, we evaluate the predictive contributions of tabular and imaging-based representations, with a focus on transformer-derived Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) embeddings. We introduce a trajectory-aware labeling strategy based on Dynamic Time Warping clustering to capture heterogeneous patterns of cognitive change, and train a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized and augmented MRI data to obtain anatomy-preserving embeddings without progression labels. The pretrained encoder embeddings are subsequently assessed using both traditional machine learning classifiers and deep learning heads, and compared against tabular representations and convolutional network baselines. Results highlight complementary strengths across modalities. Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for predicting mild and severe progression, underscoring their utility in capturing global decline trajectories. In contrast, MRI embeddings from the ViT model were most effective in distinguishing cognitively stable individuals with an AUC of 0.71. However, all approaches struggled in the heterogeneous moderate group. These findings indicate that clinical features excel in identifying high-risk extremes, whereas transformer-based MRI embeddings are more sensitive to subtle markers of stability, motivating multimodal fusion strategies for AD progression modeling."

To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities. CCSD adopts a shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates two self-distillation strategies: (i) a hierarchical modality self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge across modality hierarchies to reduce semantic discrepancies, and (ii) a progressive modality combination distillation approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities by simulating gradual modality dropout during training. Extensive experiments on public brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that CCSD achieves state-of-the-art performance across various missing-modality scenarios, with strong generalization and stability."

DSBench encompasses two major categories: external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety, divided into 10 key categories and a total of 28 sub-categories. This comprehensive evaluation covers a wide range of scenarios, ensuring a thorough assessment of VLMs' performance in safety-critical contexts. Extensive evaluations across various mainstream open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance degradation under complex safety-critical situations, highlighting urgent safety concerns. To address this, we constructed a large dataset of 98K instances focused on in-cabin and external safety scenarios, showing that fine-tuning on this dataset significantly enhances the safety performance of existing VLMs and paves the way for advancing autonomous driving technology.

We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD. These results highlight the added value of regional WMH quantification. Incorporating localized lesion metrics alongside atrophy markers may enhance early diagnosis and stratification in neurodegenerative disorders."

To bridge this gap, we present OmniZip, a training-free, audio-guided audio-visual token-compression framework that optimizes multimodal token representation and accelerates inference. Specifically, OmniZip first identifies salient audio tokens, then computes an audio retention score for each time group to capture information density, thereby dynamically guiding video token pruning and preserving cues from audio anchors enhanced by cross-modal similarity. For each time window, OmniZip compresses the video tokens using an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme.

      "summary": "Robots can adapt to user preferences by learning reward functions from demonstrations, but with limited data, reward models often overfit to spurious correlations and fail to generalize. This happens because demonstrations show robots how to do a task but not what matters for that task, causing the model to focus on irrelevant state details. Natural language can more directly specify what the robot should focus on, and, in principle, disambiguate between many reward functions consistent with the demonstrations. However, existing language-conditioned reward learning methods typically treat instructions as simple conditioning signals, without fully exploiting their potential to resolve ambiguity. Moreover, real instructions are often ambiguous themselves, so naive conditioning is unreliable. Our key insight is that these two input types carry complementary information: demonstrations show how to act, while language specifies what is important. We propose Masked Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Masked IRL), a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to combine the strengths of both input types. Masked IRL infers state-relevance masks from language instructions and enforces invariance to irrelevant state components. When instructions are ambiguous, it uses LLM reasoning to clarify them in the context of the demonstrations. In simulation and on a real robot, Masked IRL outperforms prior language-conditioned IRL methods by up to 15% while using up to 4.7 times less data, demonstrating improved sample-efficiency, generalization, and robustness to ambiguous language.

To model complex hand-object interaction with mutual occlusion and edge blur, we present interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with newly introduced optimizable parameters aiming to adopt piecewise linear hypothesis for clearer structural representation. Moreover, considering the complementarity and tightness of hand shape and object shape during interaction dynamics, we incorporate hand information into object deformation field, constructing interaction-aware dynamic fields to model flexible motions. To further address difficulties in the optimization process, we propose a progressive strategy that handles dynamic regions and static background step by step. Correspondingly, explicit regularizations are designed to stabilize the hand-object representations for smooth motion transition, physical interaction reality, and coherent lighting. Experiments show that our approach surpasses existing dynamic 3D-GS-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing dynamic hand-object interaction."

An SDF is an implicit function that can query signed distances at specific coordinates for recovering a 3D surface. Although implicit functions work well on a single shape or scene, they pose obstacles when analyzing multiple SDFs with high-fidelity geometry details, due to the limited information encoded in the latent space for SDFs and the loss of geometry details. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a method to represent multiple SDFs in a common space, aiming to recover more high-fidelity geometry details with more compact latent representations. Our key idea is to take full advantage of the benefits of generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies, which manage to preserve high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes. Based on this framework, we also introduce a novel sampling strategy to sample training queries. The sampling can improve the training efficiency and eliminate artifacts caused by the influence of other SDFs. We report numerical and visual evaluations on widely used benchmarks to validate our designs and show advantages over the latest methods in terms of the representative ability and compactness."

In this paper, we propose decoupled VAE (DeCo-VAE) to achieve compact latent representation. Instead of encoding RGB pixels directly, we decompose video content into distinct components via explicit decoupling: keyframe, motion and residual, and learn dedicated latent representation for each. To avoid cross-component interference, we design dedicated encoders for each decoupled component and adopt a shared 3D decoder to maintain spatiotemporal consistency during reconstruction. We further utilize a decoupled adaptation strategy that freezes partial encoders while training the others sequentially, ensuring stable training and accurate learning of both static and dynamic features. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DeCo-VAE achieves superior video reconstruction performance."

      "summary": "Underwater image restoration and enhancement are crucial for correcting color distortion and restoring image details, thereby establishing a fundamental basis for subsequent underwater visual tasks. However, current deep learning methodologies in this area are frequently constrained by the scarcity of high-quality paired datasets. Since it is difficult to obtain pristine reference labels in underwater scenes, existing benchmarks often rely on manually selected results from enhancement algorithms, providing debatable reference images that lack globally consistent color and authentic supervision. This limits the model's capabilities in color restoration, image enhancement, and generalization. To overcome this limitation, we propose using in-air natural images as unambiguous reference targets and translating them into underwater-degraded versions, thereby constructing synthetic datasets that provide authentic supervision signals for model learning. Specifically, we establish a generative data framework based on unpaired image-to-image translation, producing a large-scale dataset that covers 6 representative underwater degradation types. The framework constructs synthetic datasets with precise ground-truth labels, which facilitate the learning of an accurate mapping from degraded underwater images to their pristine scene appearances. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across 6 representative network architectures and 3 independent test sets show that models trained on our synthetic data achieve comparable or superior color restoration and generalization performance to those trained on existing benchmarks. This research provides a reliable and scalable data-driven solution for underwater image restoration and enhancement.

However, this comes at the price of a deterioration in image quality due to the low dose of radiation used to reduce the risk of secondary cancer development. While some efficient methods have been proposed to enhance LDCT quality, many overestimate noise and perform excessive smoothing, leading to a loss of critical details. In this paper, we introduce D-PerceptCT, a novel architecture inspired by key principles of the Human Visual System (HVS) to enhance LDCT images. The objective is to guide the model to enhance or preserve perceptually relevant features, thereby providing radiologists with CT images where critical anatomical structures and fine pathological details are perceptu- ally visible. D-PerceptCT consists of two main blocks: 1) a Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex), which integrates semantic priors from a pretrained DINOv2 model with local spatial features, allowing the network to incorporate semantic-awareness during enhancement; (2) a Global-Local State-Space block that captures long-range information and multiscale features to preserve the important structures and fine details for diagnosis. In addition, we propose a novel deep perceptual loss, designated as the Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF), which is inspired by human contrast sensitivity, to further emphasize perceptually important features. Extensive experiments on the Mayo2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of D-PerceptCT method for LDCT enhancement, showing better preservation of structural and textural information within LDCT images compared to SOTA methods."

      "summary": "Achieving a balance between lightweight design and high performance remains a significant challenge for speech enhancement (SE) tasks on resource-constrained devices. Existing state-of-the-art methods, such as MUSE, have established a strong baseline with only 0.51M parameters by introducing a Multi-path Enhanced Taylor (MET) transformer and Deformable Embedding (DE). However, an in-depth analysis reveals that MUSE still suffers from efficiency bottlenecks: the MET module relies on a complex \"approximate-compensate\" mechanism to mitigate the limitations of Taylor-expansion-based attention, while the offset calculation for deformable embedding introduces additional computational burden. This paper proposes IMSE, a systematically optimized and ultra-lightweight network. We introduce two core innovations: 1) Replacing the MET module with Amplitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA). MALA fundamentally rectifies the \"amplitude-ignoring\" problem in linear attention by explicitly preserving the norm information of query vectors in the attention calculation, achieving efficient global modeling without an auxiliary compensation branch. 2) Replacing the DE module with Inception Depthwise Convolution (IDConv). IDConv borrows the Inception concept, decomposing large-kernel operations into efficient parallel branches (square, horizontal, and vertical strips), thereby capturing spectrogram features with extremely low parameter redundancy. Extensive experiments on the VoiceBank+DEMAND dataset demonstrate that, compared to the MUSE baseline, IMSE significantly reduces the parameter count by 16.8\\% (from 0.513M to 0.427M) while achieving competitive performance comparable to the state-of-the-art on the PESQ metric (3.373). This study sets a new benchmark for the trade-off between model size and speech quality in ultra-lightweight speech enhancement."

The UAV flies autonomously within an obstacle-free flight funnel derived from geodata, detecting and localizing heat sources. An operator supervises the operation on a handheld controller and selects a fire target in reach. After the selection, the UAV automatically plans and traverses between two triangulation poses for continued fire localization. Simultaneously, our system steers the fire monitor to ensure the water jet reaches the detected heat source. In preliminary tests, our assistance system successfully localized multiple heat sources and directed a water jet towards the fires."

Distinct from approaches that employ Transformers to model holistic task relationships, PAMM leverages the rich, scalable parameters of state space models to enhance task interconnectivity. It features dual state space parameter experts that integrate and set task-specific parameter priors, capturing the intrinsic properties of each task. This approach not only facilitates precise multi-task interactions but also allows for the global integration of task priors through the structured state space sequence model (S4). Furthermore, we employ the Multi-Directional Hilbert Scanning method to construct multi-angle feature sequences, thereby enhancing the sequence model's perceptual capabilities for 2D data.

However, generalization is still a key limitation for the current system, which refers to the ability to handle unseen scenarios or unfamiliar sensor configurations.Related works have explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address few-shot or zero-shot tasks. While promising, these methods introduce a new challenge: the emergence of a hybrid AD system, where two distinct systems are used to plan a trajectory, leading to potential inconsistencies. Alternative research directions have explored Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks that generate control actions from VLM directly. However, these end-to-end solutions demonstrate prohibitive computational demands. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD), a novel framework that leverages VLMs to enhance the training of End-to-End (E2E) AD backbones. By providing risk attention for key objects, RSD addresses the issue of generalization. Specifically, we introduce RiskHead, a plug-in module that distills causal risk estimates from Vision-Language Models into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, yielding interpretable risk-attention maps.This approach allows BEV features to learn richer and more nuanced risk attention representations, which directly enhance the model's ability to handle spatial boundaries and risky objects.By focusing on risk attention, RSD aligns better with human-like driving behavior, which is essential to navigate in complex and dynamic environments. Our experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of RSD in managing complex and unpredictable driving conditions. Due to the enhanced BEV representations enabled by RSD, we observed a significant improvement in both perception and planning capabilities."

The task is particularly challenging for smallholder farms, where accurate delineation requires the use of high resolution (HR) imagery which are available only at low revisit frequencies (e.g., annually). To support more frequent (sub-) seasonal monitoring, HR images could be combined as references (ref) with low resolution (LR) images -- having higher revisit frequency (e.g., weekly) -- using reference-based super-resolution (Ref-SR) methods. However, current Ref-SR methods optimize perceptual quality and smooth over crucial features needed for downstream tasks, and are unable to meet the large scale-factor requirements for this task. Further, previous two-step approaches of SR followed by segmentation do not effectively utilize diverse satellite sources as inputs. We address these problems through a new approach, $\\textbf{SEED-SR}$, which uses a combination of conditional latent diffusion models and large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models. Our key innovation is to bypass the explicit SR task in the pixel space and instead perform SR in a segmentation-aware latent space. This unique approach enables us to generate segmentation maps at an unprecedented 20$\\times$ scale factor, and rigorous experiments on two large, real datasets demonstrate up to $\\textbf{25.5}$ and $\\textbf{12.9}$ relative improvement in instance and semantic segmentation metrics respectively over approaches based on state-of-the-art Ref-SR methods."

To measure real-world generalization, we adopt leakage-safe blockwise hold-outs (vertical/horizontal) with safety buffers and report metrics only on held-out cores. Across two Greenland sub-regions, our approach achieves strong test-core accuracy and high structural fidelity, outperforming U-Net, Attention U-Net, FPN, and a plain CNN. The residual-over-prior design, combined with physics, yields spatially coherent, physically plausible beds suitable for operational mapping under domain shift."

To overcome this, we propose CompEvent, a complex neural network framework enabling holistic full-process fusion of event data and RGB frames for enhanced joint restoration. CompEvent features two core components: 1) Complex Temporal Alignment GRU, which utilizes complex-valued convolutions and processes video and event streams iteratively via GRU to achieve temporal alignment and continuous fusion; and 2) Complex Space-Frequency Learning module, which performs unified complex-valued signal processing in both spatial and frequency domains, facilitating deep fusion through spatial structures and system-level characteristics. By leveraging the holistic representation capability of complex-valued neural networks, CompEvent achieves full-process spatiotemporal fusion, maximizes complementary learning between modalities, and significantly strengthens low-light video deblurring capability.

Our system combines a magnetically actuated flexible endoscope with teleoperated and semi-autonomous navigation capabilities for performing targeted laser ablations.

AVI introduces three key innovations: (1) a human-inspired three-phase reasoning process (Retrieve-Perceive-Review) that ensures both sufficient global exploration and focused local analysis, (2) a structured video knowledge base organized through entity graphs, along with multi-granularity integrated tools, constituting the agent's interaction environment, and (3) an open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with lightweight base CV models and VLM, eliminating dependence on proprietary APIs or RL training.

For evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark across ten datasets, covering clean and corrupted image recognition, texture-shape cue conflict tests, silhouette recognition, depth-order classification, and the visual cliff paradigm. All CATDiet variants demonstrate enhanced robustness in object recognition, despite being trained solely on object-centric videos. Remarkably, models also exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns, including neural plasticity changes mirroring synaptic density in macaque V1 and behaviors resembling infants' visual cliff responses. Building on these insights, CombDiet initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity. Trained on object-centric or head-mounted infant videos, CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception. Together, these results suggest that the developmental progression of early infant visual experience offers a powerful reverse-engineering framework for understanding the emergence of robust visual intelligence in machines.

A suite of robotic specification patterns, along with their formalisation in NASA's Formal Requirements Elicitation Tool (FRET) already exists. These pre-existing requirement patterns are domain agnostic and, in this paper we explore their applicability for space missions. To achieve this we carried out a literature review of existing space missions and formalised their requirements using FRET, contributing a corpus of space mission requirements. We categorised these requirements using pre-existing specification patterns which demonstrated their applicability in space missions. However, not all of the requirements that we formalised corresponded to an existing pattern so we have contributed 5 new requirement specification patterns as well as several variants of the existing and new patterns. We also conducted an expert evaluation of the new patterns, highlighting their benefits and limitations."

We demonstrate Safe-ROS on an AgileX Scout Mini robot performing autonomous inspection in a nuclear environment. One safety requirement is selected and instantiated as a SIF. To support verification, we implement the SIF as a cognitive agent, programmed to stop the robot whenever it detects that it is too close to an obstacle. We verify that the agent meets the safety requirement and integrate it into the autonomous inspection. This integration is also verified, and the full deployment is validated in a Gazebo simulation, and lab testing. We evaluate this architecture in the context of the UK nuclear sector, where safety and regulation are crucial aspects of deployment. Success criteria include the development of a formal property from the safety requirement, implementation, and verification of the SIF, and the integration of the SIF into the operational robotic autonomous system.

Ensuring the reliability of the software controlling these systems is therefore critical. Mutation testing, a technique widely used in software engineering, evaluates the effectiveness of test suites by introducing small faults, or mutants, into the code. However, traditional mutation operators are poorly suited to robotic programs, which involve message-based commands and interactions with the physical world. This paper explores the adaptation of mutation testing to IRS by defining domain-specific mutation operators that capture the semantics of robot actions and sensor readings. We propose a methodology for generating meaningful mutants at the level of high-level read and write operations, including movement, gripper actions, and sensor noise injection. An empirical study on a pick-and-place scenario demonstrates that our approach produces more informative mutants and reduces the number of invalid or equivalent cases compared to conventional operators. Results highlight the potential of mutation testing to enhance test suite quality and contribute to safer, more reliable industrial robotic systems."

      "summary": "Effective contact-rich manipulation requires robots to synergistically leverage vision, force, and proprioception. However, Reinforcement Learning agents struggle to learn in such multisensory settings, especially amidst sensory noise and dynamic changes. We propose MultiSensory Dynamic Pretraining (MSDP), a novel framework for learning expressive multisensory representations tailored for task-oriented policy learning. MSDP is based on masked autoencoding and trains a transformer-based encoder by reconstructing multisensory observations from only a subset of sensor embeddings, leading to cross-modal prediction and sensor fusion. For downstream policy learning, we introduce a novel asymmetric architecture, where a cross-attention mechanism allows the critic to extract dynamic, task-specific features from the frozen embeddings, while the actor receives a stable pooled representation to guide its actions. Our method demonstrates accelerated learning and robust performance under diverse perturbations, including sensor noise, and changes in object dynamics. Evaluations in multiple challenging, contact-rich robot manipulation tasks in simulation and the real world showcase the effectiveness of MSDP. Our approach exhibits strong robustness to perturbations and achieves high success rates on the real robot with as few as 6,000 online interactions, offering a simple yet powerful solution for complex multisensory robotic control."

Traditional methods for locating landmarks are time-consuming and require specialized knowledge and expertise. Current methods utilize superimposition and deep learning-based methods that employ automatic annotation of landmarks. However, these methods are not reliable due to insufficient large-scale validation studies. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework Cranio-ID: First, an automatic annotation of landmarks on 2D skulls (which are X-ray scans of faces) with their respective optical images using our trained YOLO-pose models. Second, cross-modal matching by formulating these landmarks into graph representations and then finding semantic correspondence between graphs of these two modalities using cross-attention and optimal transport framework. Our proposed framework is validated on the S2F and CUHK datasets (CUHK dataset resembles with S2F dataset). Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, which demonstrates significant improvements in both reliability and accuracy, as well as its effectiveness in cross-domain skull-to-face and sketch-to-face matching in forensic science."

      "summary": "A key challenge in Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is to continually learn under shifting distributions while preserving knowledge from previous domains. Existing methods face a fundamental dilemma. On one hand, projecting all domains into a single unified visual space leads to inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, as large shifts may vary with not only visual appearance but also underlying semantics. On the other hand, isolating domain-specific parameters causes knowledge fragmentation, creating \"knowledge islands\" that hamper knowledge reuse and exacerbate forgetting. To address this issue, we propose LAVA (Language-Anchored Visual Alignment), a novel DIL framework that replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by a text-based reference anchor. LAVA guides the visual representations of each incoming domain to preserve a consistent relative geometry, which is defined by mirroring the pairwise semantic similarities between the class names. This anchored geometric structure acts as a bridge across domains, enabling the retrieval of class-aware prior knowledge and facilitating robust feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on standard DIL benchmarks demonstrate that LAVA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/ShuyiGeng/LAVA."

Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states."

While traditional methods estimate the human in image coordinates, many applications require human motion to be estimated in world coordinates. This is particularly challenging when there is both human and camera motion. Progress on this topic has been limited by the lack of rich video data with ground truth human and camera movement. We address this with BEDLAM2.0, a new dataset that goes beyond the popular BEDLAM dataset in important ways. In addition to introducing more diverse and realistic cameras and camera motions, BEDLAM2.0 increases diversity and realism of body shape, motions, clothing, hair, and 3D environments. Additionally, it adds shoes, which were missing in BEDLAM. BEDLAM has become a key resource for training 3D human pose and motion regressors today and we show that BEDLAM2.0 is significantly better, particularly for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates. We compare state-of-the art methods trained on BEDLAM and BEDLAM2.0, and find that BEDLAM2.0 significantly improves accuracy over BEDLAM. For research purposes, we provide the rendered videos, ground truth body parameters, and camera motions. We also provide the 3D assets to which we have rights and links to those from third parties."

To address this limitation, we introduce TLS-Assist, a modular redundancy layer that augments LLM-based autonomous driving agents with explicit traffic light and sign recognition. TLS-Assist converts detections into structured natural language messages that are injected into the LLM input, enforcing explicit attention to safety-critical cues. The framework is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and supports both single-view and multi-view camera setups. We evaluate TLS-Assist in a closed-loop setup on the LangAuto benchmark in CARLA. The results demonstrate relative driving performance improvements of up to 14% over LMDrive and 7% over BEVDriver, while consistently reducing traffic light and sign infractions. We publicly release the code and models on https://github.com/iis-esslingen/TLS-Assist."

Therefore, the effectiveness of Physical Adversarial Examples (PAEs) on stereo-based binocular depth estimation remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision. We further propose a novel merging attack that seamlessly blends the target into the environment through fine-grained PAE optimization. It has significantly enhanced stealth and lethality upon existing hiding attacks that fail to get seamlessly merged into the background. Extensive evaluations show that our PAEs can successfully fool the stereo models into producing erroneous depth information."

The method quantifies shoulder yaw and roll using only the 3D coordinates of two shoulder landmarks provided by common pose estimation frameworks. The algorithm was evaluated on a dataset of 121 portrait images. The resulting SPE scores demonstrated a strong Pearson correlation (r approx. 0.80) with human-assigned labels. An analysis of the metric's filtering performance, using an adapted Error-versus-Discard methodology, confirmed its utility in identifying non-compliant samples. The proposed algorithm is a viable lightweight tool for automated compliance checking in enrolment systems."

Generally, detection performance heavily depends on the discriminative feature representation between target and background. Existing methods typically treat deblurring as a preprocessing step focused on visual quality, while neglecting the enhancement of task-relevant features crucial for detection. Improving feature representation for detection under blur conditions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel Joint Feature-Domain Deblurring and Detection end-to-end framework, dubbed JFD3. We design a dual-branch architecture with shared weights, where the clear branch guides the blurred branch to enhance discriminative feature representation. Specifically, we first introduce a lightweight feature restoration network, where features from the clear branch serve as feature-level supervision to guide the blurred branch, thereby enhancing its distinctive capability for detection. We then propose a frequency structure guidance module that refines the structure prior from the restoration network and integrates it into shallow detection layers to enrich target structural information. Finally, a feature consistency self-supervised loss is imposed between the dual-branch detection backbones, driving the blurred branch to approximate the feature representations of the clear one. Wealso construct a benchmark, named IRBlurUAV, containing 30,000 simulated and 4,118 real infrared UAV target images with diverse motion blur. Extensive experiments on IRBlurUAV demonstrate that JFD3 achieves superior detection performance while maintaining real-time efficiency."

To address this, we present two key contributions: (1) a new, large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets designed to facilitate both pretraining and instruction tuning, and (2) O3SLM, an LVLM trained on this dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple sketch-based tasks: (a) object localization, (b) counting, (c) image retrieval i.e., (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and (d) visual question answering (VQA); while incorporating the three existing sketch datasets, namely QuickDraw!, Sketchy, and Tu Berlin, along with our generated SketchVCL dataset, show that O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning."

We propose Image-Based Gaussian Splatting, an efficient alternative that leverages high-resolution source images for fine details and view-specific color modeling. Specifically, we model each pixel color as a combination of a base color from standard 3DGS rendering and a learned residual inferred from neighboring training images. This promotes accurate surface alignment and enables rendering images of high-frequency details and accurate view-dependent effects.

These factors hinder the stability of appearance-based similarity metrics and often lead to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments. To address these limitations, we propose DentalSCR, a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for accurate and interpretable silhouette-to-contour registration. Our method first constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch anatomical coordinate system, thereby stabilizing initialization and standardizing projection geometry across cases. Using this reference frame, we generate radiograph-like projections via a surface-based DRR formulation with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, which preserves clinical source-object-detector magnification and emphasizes external silhouettes. Registration is then formulated as a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule, enabling both large capture range and subpixel-level contour agreement. We evaluate DentalSCR on 34 expert-annotated clinical cases. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in landmark error-particularly at posterior teeth-tighter dispersion on the lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at the curve level. These findings indicate that DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D--2D alignment, outperforming conventional baselines."

Moreover, raw intraoral meshes exhibit substantial variation in arch pose, incomplete geometry caused by occlusion or tooth contact, and a lack of texture cues, making unified semantic interpretation highly challenging. To address these limitations, we propose ArchMap, a training-free and knowledge-guided framework for robust structured dental understanding. ArchMap first introduces a geometry-aware arch-flattening module that standardizes raw 3D meshes into spatially aligned, continuity-preserving multi-view projections. We then construct a Dental Knowledge Base (DKB) encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain the symbolic reasoning space. We validate ArchMap on 1060 pre-/post-orthodontic cases, demonstrating robust performance in tooth counting, anatomical partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and the identification of clinical conditions such as crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, and caries. Compared with supervised pipelines and prompted VLM baselines, ArchMap achieves higher accuracy, reduced semantic drift, and superior stability under sparse or artifact-prone conditions. As a fully training-free system, ArchMap demonstrates that combining geometric normalization with ontology-guided multimodal reasoning offers a practical and scalable solution for the structured analysis of 3D intraoral scans in modern digital orthodontics."

While the current methods demonstrate efficacy in small and controlled settings, they face challenges when applied to large-scale and diverse environments, marked by extended periods of exploration and suboptimal paths of discovery. In this paper, we propose MA-SLAM, a Map-Aware Active SLAM system based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), designed to address the challenge of efficient exploration in large-scale environments. In pursuit of this objective, we put forward a novel structured map representation. By discretizing the spatial data and integrating the boundary points and the historical trajectory, the structured map succinctly and effectively encapsulates the visited regions, thereby serving as input for the deep reinforcement learning based decision module. Instead of sequentially predicting the next action step within the decision module, we have implemented an advanced global planner to optimize the exploration path by leveraging long-range target points. We conducted experiments in three simulation environments and deployed in a real unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), the results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces both the duration and distance of exploration compared with state-of-the-art methods."

      "summary": "Scaling up network depth is a fundamental pursuit in neural architecture design, as theory suggests that deeper models offer exponentially greater capability. Benefiting from the residual connections, modern neural networks can scale up to more than one hundred layers and enjoy wide success. However, as networks continue to deepen, current architectures often struggle to realize their theoretical capacity improvements, calling for more advanced designs to further unleash the potential of deeper networks. In this paper, we identify two key barriers that obstruct residual models from scaling deeper: shortcut degradation and limited width. Shortcut degradation hinders deep-layer learning, while the inherent depth-width trade-off imposes limited width. To mitigate these issues, we propose a generalized residual architecture dubbed Step by Step Network (StepsNet) to bridge the gap between theoretical potential and practical performance of deep models. Specifically, we separate features along the channel dimension and let the model learn progressively via stacking blocks with increasing width. The resulting method mitigates the two identified problems and serves as a versatile macro design applicable to various models. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms residual models across diverse tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and language modeling. These results position StepsNet as a superior generalization of the widely adopted residual architecture."

However, this interaction is complex in two key aspects: (1) the motion involved, and (2) the non-linear behaviour of soft tissues. Multiple approaches have been undertaken to better understand this interaction and to improve the quantitative metrics of physical interfaces or cuffs. As these two topics are closely interrelated, finite modelling and soft tissue characterisation offer valuable insights into pressure distribution and shear stress induced by the cuff. Nevertheless, current characterisation methods typically rely on a single fitting variable along one degree of freedom, which limits their applicability, given that interactions with wearable robots often involve multiple degrees of freedom. To address this limitation, this work introduces a dual-variable characterisation method, involving normal and tangential forces, aimed at identifying reliable material parameters and evaluating the impact of single-variable fitting on force and torque responses. This method demonstrates the importance of incorporating two variables into the characterisation process by analysing the normalized mean square error (NMSE) across different scenarios and material models, providing a foundation for simulation at the closest possible level, with a focus on the cuff and the human limb involved in the physical interaction between the user and the wearable robot."

Most existing methods, whether using invasive sensors or computer vision, rely on two-stage pipelines, which result in high intrusiveness, intensive computation, and poor real-time performance on embedded edge devices. Inspired by YOLOv11-Pose, a lightweight single-stage network for sitting posture recognition on embedded edge devices termed LSP-YOLO was proposed. By integrating partial convolution(PConv) and Similarity-Aware Activation Module(SimAM), a lightweight module, Light-C3k2, was designed to reduce computational cost while maintaining feature extraction capability. In the recognition head, keypoints were directly mapped to posture classes through pointwise convolution, and intermediate supervision was employed to enable efficient fusion of pose estimation and classification. Furthermore, a dataset containing 5,000 images across six posture categories was constructed for model training and testing. The smallest trained model, LSP-YOLO-n, achieved 94.2% accuracy and 251 Fps on personal computer(PC) with a model size of only 1.9 MB. Meanwhile, real-time and high-accuracy inference under constrained computational resources was demonstrated on the SV830C + GC030A platform. The proposed approach is characterized by high efficiency, lightweight design and deployability, making it suitable for smart classrooms, rehabilitation, and human-computer interaction applications."

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases. Experimental results demonstrate that Dental3R effectively handles sparse, unposed inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods."

Motivated by results on the Exponential Decay of Sensitivities (EDS), which imply that, under certain conditions, the influence of modeling inaccuracies decreases exponentially along the prediction horizon, this paper proposes a multi-timescale MPC scheme for fast-sampled control. Tailored to systems with both fast and slow dynamics, the proposed approach improves computational efficiency by i) switching to a reduced model that captures only the slow, dominant dynamics and ii) exponentially increasing integration step sizes to progressively reduce model detail along the horizon.

However, practical systems are often constrained by ultra-sparse-view sampling, which significantly degrades reconstruction quality. Traditional methods struggle under ultra-sparse-view settings, where interpolation becomes inaccurate and the resulting reconstructions are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, this study proposes Diffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF), an iterative framework tailored for multi-source stationary CT under ultra-sparse-view conditions. Diff-NAF combines a Neural Attenuation Field representation with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model. The process begins by training an initial NAF using ultra-sparse-view projections. New projections are then generated through an Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis strategy that exploits inter view priors, and are subsequently refined by a Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module. The refined projections are incorporated as pseudo-labels into the training set for the next iteration. Through iterative refinement, Diff-NAF progressively enhances projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity under ultra-sparse-view conditions, ultimately yielding high-quality CT reconstructions. Experimental results on multiple simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data demonstrate that Diff-NAF achieves the best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions."

These constraints reduce the quality and stability of pseudo-labels, while large models, though more accurate, cannot be trained or used for routine inference on client devices. We propose SAM-Fed, a federated semi-supervised framework that leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients during training. SAM-Fed combines dual knowledge distillation with an adaptive agreement mechanism to refine pixel-level supervision. Experiments on skin lesion and polyp segmentation across homogeneous and heterogeneous settings show that SAM-Fed consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSSL methods."

During surgery, these plans must be accurately transferred, relying on precise cross-registration between preoperative and intraoperative data. However, substantial modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities makes this registration challenging and error-prone. Robust, automatic, and modality-agnostic bone surface registration is therefore clinically important. We propose NeuralBoneReg, a self-supervised, surface-based framework that registers bone surfaces using 3D point clouds as a modality-agnostic representation. NeuralBoneReg includes two modules: an implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) that learns the preoperative bone model, and an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement by generating transformation hypotheses to align the intraoperative point cloud with the neural UDF. Unlike SOTA supervised methods, NeuralBoneReg operates in a self-supervised manner, without requiring inter-subject training data. We evaluated NeuralBoneReg against baseline methods on two publicly available multi-modal datasets: a CT-ultrasound dataset of the fibula and tibia (UltraBones100k) and a CT-RGB-D dataset of spinal vertebrae (SpineDepth). The evaluation also includes a newly introduced CT--ultrasound dataset of cadaveric subjects containing femur and pelvis (UltraBones-Hip), which will be made publicly available. NeuralBoneReg matches or surpasses existing methods across all datasets, achieving mean RRE/RTE of 1.68°/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k, 1.88°/1.89 mm on UltraBones-Hip, and 3.79°/2.45 mm on SpineDepth.

To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a general framework that repurposes large vision-language models (VLMs) as powerful, differentiable semantic and spatial critics. Our core contribution is a dual-query critic signal derived from the VLM's Yes or No log-odds, which assesses both semantic fidelity and geometric coherence. We demonstrate the generality of this guidance signal across two distinct paradigms: (1) As a reward objective for optimization-based pipelines, VLM3D significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks. (2) As a test-time guidance module for feed-forward pipelines, it actively steers the iterative sampling process of SOTA native 3D models to correct severe spatial errors. VLM3D establishes a principled and generalizable path to inject the VLM's rich, language-grounded understanding of both semantics and space into diverse 3D generative pipelines."

Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge.

Current approaches excessively rely on implicit network modeling of spatiotemporal relationships and motion characteristics, falling into the passive learning trap that results in redundant and monotonous 3D coordinate information acquisition while lacking actively guided explicit learning mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose an Active Perceptual Strategy (APS) for human motion prediction, leveraging quotient space representations to explicitly encode motion properties while introducing auxiliary learning objectives to strengthen spatio-temporal modeling. Specifically, we first design a data perception module that projects poses into the quotient space, decoupling motion geometry from coordinate redundancy. By jointly encoding tangent vectors and Grassmann projections, this module simultaneously achieves geometric dimension reduction, semantic decoupling, and dynamic constraint enforcement for effective motion pose characterization. Furthermore, we introduce a network perception module that actively learns spatio-temporal dependencies through restorative learning. This module deliberately masks specific joints or injects noise to construct auxiliary supervision signals. A dedicated auxiliary learning network is designed to actively adapt and learn from perturbed information. Notably, APS is model agnostic and can be integrated with different prediction models to enhance active perceptual. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods by large margins: 16.3% on H3.6M, 13.9% on CMU Mocap, and 10.1% on 3DPW."

      "summary": "This paper focuses on the task of speech-driven 3D facial animation, which aims to generate realistic and synchronized facial motions driven by speech inputs.Recent methods have employed audio-conditioned diffusion models for 3D facial animation, achieving impressive results in generating expressive and natural animations.However, these methods process the whole audio sequences in a single pass, which poses two major challenges: they tend to perform poorly when handling audio sequences that exceed the training horizon and will suffer from significant latency when processing long audio inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel autoregressive diffusion model that processes input audio in a streaming manner. This design ensures flexibility with varying audio lengths and achieves low latency independent of audio duration. Specifically, we select a limited number of past frames as historical motion context and combine them with the audio input to create a dynamic condition. This condition guides the diffusion process to iteratively generate facial motion frames, enabling real-time synthesis with high-quality results. Additionally, we implemented a real-time interactive demo, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. We will release the code at https://zju3dv.github.io/StreamingTalker/."

However, existing methods typically produce deterministic results, struggling to capture this one-to-many nature. In this paper, we propose a Measurement-Constrained Sampling (MCS) approach that enables diverse LQ face reconstructions conditioned on different textual prompts. Specifically, we formulate BFR as a measurement-constrained generative task by constructing an inverse problem through controlled degradations of coarse restorations, which allows posterior-guided sampling within text-to-image diffusion. Measurement constraints include both Forward Measurement, which ensures results align with input structures, and Reverse Measurement, which produces projection spaces, ensuring that the solution can align with various prompts. Experiments show that our MCS can generate prompt-aligned results and outperforms existing BFR methods. Codes will be released after acceptance."

Diffusion-based priors currently deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions, but existing approaches either adapt image diffusion models with ad hoc temporal regularizers - leading to temporal artifacts - or rely on native video diffusion models whose iterative posterior sampling is far too slow for real-time use. We introduce InstantViR, an amortized inference framework for ultra-fast video reconstruction powered by a pre-trained video diffusion prior. We distill a powerful bidirectional video diffusion model (teacher) into a causal autoregressive student that maps a degraded video directly to its restored version in a single forward pass, inheriting the teacher's strong temporal modeling while completely removing iterative test-time optimization. The distillation is prior-driven: it only requires the teacher diffusion model and known degradation operators, and does not rely on externally paired clean/noisy video data. To further boost throughput, we replace the video-diffusion backbone VAE with a high-efficiency LeanVAE via an innovative teacher-space regularized distillation scheme, enabling low-latency latent-space processing. Across streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring and super-resolution, InstantViR matches or surpasses the reconstruction quality of diffusion-based baselines while running at over 35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving up to 100 times speedups over iterative video diffusion solvers. These results show that diffusion-based video reconstruction is compatible with real-time, interactive, editable, streaming scenarios, turning high-quality video restoration into a practical component of modern vision systems."

      "summary": "Maritime vessel re-identification (Re-ID) plays a crucial role in advancing maritime monitoring and intelligent situational awareness systems. However, some existing vessel Re-ID methods are directly adapted from pedestrian-focused algorithms, making them ill-suited for mitigating the unique problems present in vessel images, particularly the greater intra-identity variations and more severe missing of local parts, which lead to the emergence of outlier samples within the same identity. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer), which explicitly models multi-scale correlations across the entire input set to suppress the adverse effects of outlier samples with intra-identity variations or local missing, incorporating two novel modules, the Global Correlation Module (GCM), and the Local Correlation Module (LCM). Specifically, GCM constructs a global similarity affinity matrix across all input images to model global correlations through feature aggregation based on inter-image consistency, rather than solely learning features from individual images as in most existing approaches. Simultaneously, LCM mines and aligns local features of positive samples with contextual similarity to extract local correlations by maintaining a dynamic memory bank, effectively compensating for missing or occluded regions in individual images. To further enhance feature robustness, MCFormer integrates global and local features that have been respectively correlated across multiple scales, effectively capturing latent relationships among image features. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that MCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance."

Online data curation extends this idea by dynamically selecting training samples based on the model's evolving state.

We introduce DetGain, an online data curation method specifically for object detection that estimates the marginal perturbation of each image to dataset-level Average Precision (AP) based on its prediction quality. By modeling global score distributions, DetGain efficiently estimates the global AP change and computes teacher-student contribution gaps to select informative samples at each iteration. The method is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive, enabling straightforward integration into diverse object detection architectures. Experiments on the COCO dataset with multiple representative detectors show consistent improvements in accuracy. DetGain also demonstrates strong robustness under low-quality data and can be effectively combined with knowledge distillation techniques to further enhance performance, highlighting its potential as a general and complementary strategy for data-efficient object detection."

Although some cross-subject methods being introduced, they often overfocus with subject-invariant information while neglecting subject-specific information, resulting in slow fine-tune-based adaptation strategy. To achieve fast and data-efficient new subject adaptation, we propose MindCross, a novel cross-subject framework. MindCross's N specific encoders and one shared encoder are designed to extract subject-specific and subject-invariant information, respectively. Additionally, a Top-K collaboration module is adopted to enhance new subject decoding with the knowledge learned from previous subjects' encoders. Extensive experiments on fMRI/EEG-to-video benchmarks demonstrate MindCross's efficacy and efficiency of cross-subject decoding and new subject adaptation using only one model."

Minimally invasive repairs involving branch vessels necessitate detailed 3D anatomical analysis. Existing methods often overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships while struggling with severe class imbalance inherent in vascular structures. We address these challenges with a curriculum learning strategy that leverages a novel fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning. Inspired by human cognition, our approach progressively learns anatomical constraints by decomposing complex structures from simple to complex components. The curriculum learning framework naturally addresses class imbalance by first establishing robust feature representations for dominant classes before tackling rare but anatomically critical structures, significantly accelerating model convergence in multi-class scenarios. Our two-stage inference strategy achieves up to fivefold acceleration, enhancing clinical practicality. On the validation set at epoch 50, our hierarchical semantic loss improves the Dice score of nnU-Net ResEnc M by 11.65%. The proposed model demonstrates a 5.6% higher Dice score than baselines on the test set. Experimental results show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making the framework suitable for real-time clinical applications.

This task is particularly challenging due to rapid succession, motion blur, and subtle visual differences. Consequently, most existing methods rely on domain-specific, end-to-end training with large labeled datasets and often struggle in few-shot conditions due to their dependence on pixel- or pose-based inputs alone. However, obtaining large labeled datasets is practically hard. We propose a Unified Multi-Entity Graph Network (UMEG-Net) for few-shot PES. UMEG-Net integrates human skeletons and sport-specific object keypoints into a unified graph and features an efficient spatio-temporal extraction module based on advanced GCN and multi-scale temporal shift. To further enhance performance, we employ multimodal distillation to transfer knowledge from keypoint-based graphs to visual representations. Our approach achieves robust performance with limited labeled data and significantly outperforms baseline models in few-shot settings, providing a scalable and effective solution for few-shot PES.

This dataset contains over 100 hours of naturalistic data from multiple production autonomous-driving vehicle models in the market. We segment the original data into 32,727 key frames, each consisting of four synchronized camera images and high-precision GNSS/IMU data (0.8 cm localization accuracy). For each key frame, 20 Hz vehicle trajectories spanning the past 6 s and future 5 s are provided, along with detailed 2D annotations of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and traffic signs. These key frames have rich scenario-level attributes, including driver intent, area type (covering highways, urban roads, and residential areas), lighting (day, night, or dusk), weather (clear or rain), road surface (paved or unpaved), traffic and vulnerable road users (VRU) density, traffic lights, and traffic signs (warning, prohibition, and indication). To evaluate the safety of AVs, we employ an end-to-end motion planning model that predicts vehicle trajectories with an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 1.4 m on autonomous-driving frames. The dataset continues to expand by over 10 hours of new data weekly, thereby providing a sustainable foundation for research on AV driving behavior analysis and safety evaluation."

These methods employ a locally supervised approach for semantic supervision, which limits the uniformity of semantic distribution. However, VA-VAE proves that a more uniform feature distribution yields better generation performance. In this work, we introduce a Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok), which utilizes global relational information to model a more uniform semantic distribution of tokenized features. Specifically, a codebook-wise histogram relation learning method is proposed to transfer the semantics, which are modeled by pre-trained models on the entire dataset, to the semantic codebook. Then, we design a residual learning module that recovers the fine-grained details to minimize the reconstruction error caused by quantization. Through the above design, GloTok delivers more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations, which facilitates the training of autoregressive (AR) models for generating high-quality images without requiring direct access to pre-trained models during the training process. Experiments on the standard ImageNet-1k benchmark clearly show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and generation quality."

The prevailing works address these degradations in isolation, developing highly specialized, specialist models that lack scalability and fail to exploit the shared underlying essences of these restoration problems. While specialist models are limited, recent large-scale pretrained generalist models offer powerful, text-driven image editing capabilities. while recent general-purpose systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Flux Kontext, Nano Banana) require detailed prompts and often fail to achieve robust removal on these fine-grained tasks or preserve identity of the scene. Leveraging the common essence of soft effects, i.e., semi-transparent occlusions, we introduce a foundational versatile model UniSER, capable of addressing diverse degradations caused by soft effects within a single framework. Our methodology centers on curating a massive 3.8M-pair dataset to ensure robustness and generalization, which includes novel, physically-plausible data to fill critical gaps in public benchmarks, and a tailored training pipeline that fine-tunes a Diffusion Transformer to learn robust restoration priors from this diverse data, integrating fine-grained mask and strength controls. This synergistic approach allows UniSER to significantly outperform both specialist and generalist models, achieving robust, high-fidelity restoration in the wild."

To address these challenges, this paper proposes Dominance-Game Contrastive Learning network for skeleton-based action Recognition (DoGCLR), a self-supervised framework based on game theory. DoGCLR models the construction of positive and negative samples as a dynamic Dominance Game, where both sample types interact to reach an equilibrium that balances semantic preservation and discriminative strength. Specifically, a spatio-temporal dual weight localization mechanism identifies key motion regions and guides region-wise augmentations to enhance motion diversity while maintaining semantics. In parallel, an entropy-driven dominance strategy manages the memory bank by retaining high entropy (hard) negatives and replacing low-entropy (weak) ones, ensuring consistent exposure to informative contrastive signals. Extensive experiments are conducted on NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD datasets. On NTU RGB+D 60 X-Sub/X-View, DoGCLR achieves 81.1%/89.4% accuracy, and on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Sub/X-Set, DoGCLR achieves 71.2%/75.5% accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 0.1%, 2.7%, 1.1%, and 2.3%, respectively.

Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy.

To facilitate fine-grained robustness evaluation, we further introduce MVI-Sensitivity, a novel metric that characterizes LVLM robustness at a granular level. Empirical results across 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs uncover pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, and our in-depth analyses on MVI-Bench provide actionable insights that can guide the development of more reliable and robust LVLMs. The benchmark and codebase can be accessed at https://github.com/chenyil6/MVI-Bench."

This is mainly due to two overlooked risks that affect cross-domain multimodal generalization. The first is the modal representation invariant risk, i.e., whether representations remain generalizable under domain shift. We theoretically show that the inherent class asymmetry in FAS (diverse spoofs vs. compact reals) enlarges the upper bound of generalization error, and this effect is further amplified in multimodal settings. The second is the modal synergy invariant risk, where models overfit to domain-specific inter-modal correlations. Such spurious synergy cannot generalize to unseen attacks in target domains, leading to performance drops. To solve these issues, we propose a provable framework, namely Multimodal Representation and Synergy Invariance Learning (RiSe). For representation risk, RiSe introduces Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM), which learns an invariant spherical decision boundary in radial space to fit asymmetric distributions, while preserving domain cues in angular space. For synergy risk, RiSe employs Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement (MMSD), a self-supervised task enhancing intrinsic, generalizable modal features via cross-sample mixing and disentanglement. Theoretical analysis and experiments verify RiSe, which achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain performance."

      "summary": "We present Wave-Former, a novel method capable of high-accuracy 3D shape reconstruction for completely occluded, diverse, everyday objects. This capability can open new applications spanning robotics, augmented reality, and logistics. Our approach leverages millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless signals, which can penetrate common occlusions and reflect off hidden objects. In contrast to past mmWave reconstruction methods, which suffer from limited coverage and high noise, Wave-Former introduces a physics-aware shape completion model capable of inferring full 3D geometry. At the heart of Wave-Former's design is a novel three-stage pipeline which bridges raw wireless signals with recent advancements in vision-based shape completion by incorporating physical properties of mmWave signals. The pipeline proposes candidate geometric surfaces, employs a transformer-based shape completion model designed specifically for mmWave signals, and finally performs entropy-guided surface selection. This enables Wave-Former to be trained using entirely synthetic point-clouds, while demonstrating impressive generalization to real-world data.In head-to-head comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines, Wave-Former raises recall from 54% to 72% while maintaining a high precision of 85%."

      "summary": "Recent trends in SLAM and visual navigation have embraced 3D Gaussians as the preferred scene representation, highlighting the importance of estimating camera poses from a single image using a pre-built Gaussian model. However, existing approaches typically rely on an iterative \\textit{render-compare-refine} loop, where candidate views are first rendered using NeRF or Gaussian Splatting, then compared against the target image, and finally, discrepancies are used to update the pose. This multi-round process incurs significant computational overhead, hindering real-time performance in robotics. In this paper, we propose iGaussian, a two-stage feed-forward framework that achieves real-time camera pose estimation through direct 3D Gaussian inversion. Our method first regresses a coarse 6DoF pose using a Gaussian Scene Prior-based Pose Regression Network with spatial uniform sampling and guided attention mechanisms, then refines it through feature matching and multi-model fusion. The key contribution lies in our cross-correlation module that aligns image embeddings with 3D Gaussian attributes without differentiable rendering, coupled with a Weighted Multiview Predictor that fuses features from Multiple strategically sampled viewpoints. Experimental results on the NeRF Synthetic, Mip-NeRF 360, and T\\&T+DB datasets demonstrate a significant performance improvement over previous methods, reducing median rotation errors to 0.2° while achieving 2.87 FPS tracking on mobile robots, which is an impressive 10 times speedup compared to optimization-based approaches.

However, traditional VLA models that generate actions through flow matching (FM) typically rely on rigid and uniform time schedules, i.e., synchronous FM (SFM). Without action context awareness and asynchronous self-correction, SFM becomes unstable in long-horizon tasks, where a single action error can cascade into failure. In this work, we propose asynchronous flow matching VLA (AsyncVLA), a novel framework that introduces temporal flexibility in asynchronous FM (AFM) and enables self-correction in action generation. AsyncVLA breaks from the vanilla SFM in VLA models by generating the action tokens in a non-uniform time schedule with action context awareness. Besides, our method introduces the confidence rater to extract confidence of the initially generated actions, enabling the model to selectively refine inaccurate action tokens before execution. Moreover, we propose a unified training procedure for SFM and AFM that endows a single model with both modes, improving KV-cache utilization. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that AsyncVLA is data-efficient and exhibits self-correction ability. AsyncVLA achieves state-of-the-art results across general embodied evaluations due to its asynchronous generation in AFM. Our code is available at https://github.com/YuhuaJiang2002/AsyncVLA."

We argue that convolution and self-attention, despite their apparent differences, can be unified within a single k-nearest neighbor aggregation framework. The critical insight is that both operations are special cases of neighbor selection and aggregation; convolution selects neighbors by spatial proximity, while attention selects by feature similarity, revealing they exist on a continuous spectrum. We introduce Convolutional Nearest Neighbors (ConvNN), a unified framework that formalizes this connection. Crucially, ConvNN serves as a drop-in replacement for convolutional and attention layers, enabling systematic exploration of the intermediate spectrum between these two extremes. We validate the framework's coherence on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification tasks across two complementary architectures: (1) Hybrid branching in VGG improves accuracy on both CIFAR datasets by combining spatial-proximity and feature-similarity selection; and (2) ConvNN in ViT outperforms standard attention and other attention variants on both datasets. Extensive ablations on $k$ values and architectural variants reveal that interpolating along this spectrum provides regularization benefits by balancing local and global receptive fields. Our work provides a unifying framework that dissolves the apparent distinction between convolution and attention, with implications for designing more principled and interpretable vision architectures."

      "summary": "Pedestrian-vehicle incidents remain a critical urban safety challenge, with pedestrians accounting for over 20% of global traffic fatalities. Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations. Evaluation on the Woven Traffic Safety dataset shows that MP-PVIR effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights, advancing AI-driven traffic safety analytics for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems."

It is crucial for downstream tasks like bias mitigation, preventing malicious adaptation, attribute disentanglement, and generalizable fine-tuning of diffusion policy. We propose Coffee that allows using language to specify undesired concepts to regularize the adaptation process. The crux of our method lies in keeping the embeddings of the user prompt from aligning with undesired concepts. Crucially, Coffee requires no additional training and enables flexible modification of undesired concepts by modifying textual descriptions. We evaluate Coffee by fine-tuning on images associated with user prompts paired with undesired concepts. Experimental results demonstrate that Coffee can prevent text-to-image models from learning specified undesired concepts during fine-tuning and outperforms existing methods.

We propose an asymmetric aggregation VPR method with geometric constraints for locally aggregated descriptors, called $A^2$GC-VPR. Our method employs row-column normalization averaging with separate marginal calibration, enabling asymmetric matching that adapts to distributional discrepancies in visual place recognition. Geometric constraints are incorporated through learnable coordinate embeddings, computing compatibility scores fused with feature similarities, thereby promoting spatially proximal features to the same cluster and enhancing spatial awareness.

We introduce reasoning video editing, a task where video editing models must interpret implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets before executing modifications, and a first model attempting to solve this complex task, RIVER (Reasoning-based Implicit Video Editor). RIVER decouples reasoning from generation through digital twin representations of video content that preserve spatial relationships, temporal trajectories, and semantic attributes. A large language model then processes this representation jointly with the implicit query, performing multi-hop reasoning to determine modifications, then outputs structured instructions that guide a diffusion-based editor to execute pixel-level changes. RIVER training uses reinforcement learning with rewards that evaluate reasoning accuracy and generation quality. Finally, we introduce RVEBenchmark, a benchmark of 100 videos with 519 implicit queries spanning three levels and categories of reasoning complexity specifically for reasoning video editing. RIVER demonstrates best performance on the proposed RVEBenchmark and also achieves state-of-the-art performance on two additional video editing benchmarks (VegGIE and FiVE), where it surpasses six baseline methods."

In this paper, for the LTR, we propose a binary cross-entropy (BCE)-based tripartite synergistic learning, termed BCE3S, which consists of three components: (1) BCE-based joint learning optimizes both the classifier and sample features, which achieves better compactness and separability among features than the CE-based joint learning, by decoupling the metrics between feature and the imbalanced classifier vectors in multiple Sigmoid; (2) BCE-based contrastive learning further improves the intra-class compactness of features; (3) BCE-based uniform learning balances the separability among classifier vectors and interactively enhances the feature properties by combining with the joint learning. The extensive experiments show that the LTR model trained by BCE3S not only achieves higher compactness and separability among sample features, but also balances the classifier's separability, achieving SOTA performance on various long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018."

We also employ an anchor-free detection head for coordinate regression, directly predicting object locations via heat-map supervision in the reference images. This approach avoids scale bias and matching complexity introduced by predefined anchor boxes.

This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved. To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured \"Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train\" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation). It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy. We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement. DEER-3D underscores the effectiveness of targeted, error-driven scene editing in bridging linguistic reasoning capabilities with spatial grounding in 3D LLMs."

The automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.84 vs 0.78), including in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21, respectively; P < 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone-loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity, with no low cases misclassified as high or vice versa. These results suggest that our method is a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and for screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss.

      "summary": "Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis but are fundamentally constrained by the requirement for large-scale, meticulously annotated datasets. This dependency on \"big data\" is a critical bottleneck in the medical domain, where patient data is inherently difficult to acquire and expert annotation is expensive, particularly for rare diseases where samples are scarce by definition. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel paradigm: Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS). Instead of adapting a pre-existing model or training a new one, our approach leverages a large-scale, pre-trained generative engine to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. Our framework, the Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS), takes as input minimal, multi-modal task information as little as a single example image (1-shot) and a corresponding clinical text description to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier.\n  The generative engine interprets these inputs to generate the weights for a lightweight, efficient classifier (e.g., an EfficientNet-V2), which can be deployed for inference immediately without any task-specific training or fine-tuning. We conduct extensive evaluations on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks derived from the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and a custom rare disease dataset. Our results demonstrate that SGPS establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot learning methods, especially in the ultra-low data regimes of 1-shot and 5-shot classification. This work paves the way for the rapid development and deployment of AI-powered diagnostic tools, particularly for the long tail of rare diseases where data is critically limited."

      "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) usually suffer from prohibitive computational and memory costs due to the quadratic growth of visual tokens with image resolution. Existing token compression methods, while varied, often lack a high-level semantic understanding, leading to suboptimal merges, information redundancy, or context loss. To address these limitations, we introduce CORE (Compact Object-centric REpresentations), a new paradigm for visual token compression. CORE leverages an efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks, which serve as a high-level semantic prior to guide the merging of visual tokens into a compact set of object-centric representations. Furthermore, a novel centroid-guided sorting mechanism restores a coherent spatial order to the merged tokens, preserving vital positional information. Extensive experiments show that CORE not only establishes a new state-of-the-art on six authoritative benchmarks for fixed-rate compression, but also achieves dramatic efficiency gains in adaptive-rate settings. Even under extreme compression, after aggressively retaining with only 2.2% of all visual tokens, CORE still maintains 97.4% of baseline performance. Our work demonstrates the superiority of object-centric representations for efficient and effective LVLM processing."

We present ELiC, a real-time framework that combines cross-bit-depth feature propagation, a Bag-of-Encoders (BoE) selection scheme, and a Morton-order-preserving hierarchy. Cross-bit-depth propagation reuses features extracted at denser, lower depths to support prediction at sparser, higher depths. BoE selects, per depth, the most suitable coding network from a small pool, adapting capacity to observed occupancy statistics without training a separate model for each level. The Morton hierarchy maintains global Z-order across depth transitions, eliminating per-level sorting and reducing latency. Together these components improve entropy modeling and computation efficiency, yielding state-of-the-art compression at real-time throughput on Ford and SemanticKITTI.

However, extending AR models to general image editing remains challenging due to weak and inefficient conditioning, often leading to poor instruction adherence and visual artifacts. To address this, we propose SCAR, a Semantic-Context-driven method for Autoregressive models. SCAR introduces two key components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling, which encodes high-level semantics into a compact and efficient prefix, and Semantic Alignment Guidance, which aligns the last visual hidden states with target semantics during autoregressive decoding to enhance instruction fidelity. Unlike decoding-stage injection methods, SCAR builds upon the flexibility and generality of vector-quantized-based prefilling while overcoming its semantic limitations and high cost. It generalizes across both next-token and next-set AR paradigms with minimal architectural changes. SCAR achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on both instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods while maintaining controllability. All code will be released."

In the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrum, CHs appear as dark patches. Using daily hand-drawn maps from the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), we developed a semi-automated pipeline to digitize the SWPC maps into binary segmentation masks. The resulting masks constitute the CHASM-SWPC dataset, a high-quality dataset to train and test automated CH detection models, which is released with this paper. We developed CHASM (Coronal Hole Annotation using Semi-automatic Methods), a software tool for semi-automatic annotation that enables users to rapidly and accurately annotate SWPC maps. The CHASM tool enabled us to annotate 1,111 CH masks, comprising the CHASM-SWPC-1111 dataset. We then trained multiple CHRONNOS (Coronal Hole RecOgnition Neural Network Over multi-Spectral-data) architecture (Jarolim et al. 2021) neural networks using the CHASM-SWPC dataset and compared their performance. Training the CHRONNOS neural network on these data achieved an accuracy of 0.9805, a True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.6807, and an intersection-over-union (IoU) of 0.5668, which is higher than the original pretrained CHRONNOS model Jarolim et al.

The second stage employs a YOLOX-based deep learning detector that operates on saliency-enhanced images obtained by applying bounding-box level brightness augmentation to salient defect regions. Experimental results on standard datasets confirm the performance of our framework and its suitability in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, which give a huge potential to be implemented in a self-powered inspection system."

Traditional navigation approaches rely on static Building Information Modeling (BIM) priors or limited onboard perception. In contrast, our framework continuously fuses real-time LiDAR data from aerial and ground robots with BIM priors to maintain an evolving 2D occupancy map. We quantify navigation safety through a unified corridor-risk metric integrating occupancy uncertainty, BIM-map discrepancy, and clearance. When risk exceeds safety thresholds, the UAV autonomously re-scans affected regions to reduce uncertainty and enable safe replanning. Validation in PX4-Gazebo simulation with Robotec GPU LiDAR demonstrates that risk-triggered re-scanning reduces mean corridor risk by 58% and map entropy by 43% compared to static BIM navigation, while maintaining clearance margins above 0.4 m. Compared to frontier-based exploration, our approach achieves similar uncertainty reduction in half the mission time. These results demonstrate that integrating BIM priors with risk-adaptive aerial sensing enables scalable, uncertainty-aware autonomy for construction robotics."

Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic models generate high-resolution flood maps using numerical methods requiring fine-grid discretization; which are computationally intensive and impractical for real-time large-scale applications. While recent studies have applied convolutional neural networks for flood map super-resolution with good accuracy and speed, they suffer from limited generalizability to unseen areas. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models to perform super-resolution on coarse-grid flood maps, with the objective of achieving the accuracy of fine-grid flood maps while significantly reducing inference time. Experimental results demonstrate that latent diffusion models substantially decrease the computational time required to produce high-fidelity flood maps without compromising on accuracy, enabling their use in real-time flood risk management. Moreover, diffusion models exhibit superior generalizability across different physical locations, with transfer learning further accelerating adaptation to new geographic regions. Our approach also incorporates physics-informed inputs, addressing the common limitation of black-box behavior in machine learning, thereby enhancing interpretability.

The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models. Specifically, RADA adaptively predicts the generated regions for each fine-grained text attribute and enforces the text attribute to focus on the predicted regions by a chained mask injection strategy, significantly enhancing the visual fidelity and the controllability. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our framework compared to existing state-of-the-art methods."

Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches. We validate WaRPAD on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance and demonstrates strong robustness to test-time corruptions. Furthermore, as invariance to RandomResizedCrop is a common training scheme across self-supervised models, we show that WaRPAD is applicable across self-supervised models."

Also, in conventional AL, annotation effort is a function of the ROI- larger regions make the task cognitively easier but incur higher annotation costs, whereas smaller regions demand finer precision and more attention from the expert. In this context, language guidance provides an effective alternative, requiring minimal expert effort while bypassing the cognitively demanding task of precise boundary delineation in segmentation. Towards this goal, we introduce LINGUAL: a framework that receives natural language instructions from an expert, translates them into executable programs through in-context learning, and automatically performs the corresponding sequence of sub-tasks without any human intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LINGUAL in active domain adaptation (ADA) achieving comparable or superior performance to AL baselines while reducing estimated annotation time by approximately 80%."

These applications usually involve navigating at high speeds through constrained spaces such as small gaps. Navigating such constrained spaces becomes particularly challenging when the space is crowded with multiple heterogeneous agents all of which have urgent priorities. What makes the problem even harder is that during an active response situation, roles and priorities can quickly change on a dime without informing the other agents. In order to complete missions in such environments, robots must not only be safe, but also agile, able to dodge and change course at a moment's notice. In this paper, we propose FACA, a fair and agile collision avoidance approach where robots coordinate their tasks by talking to each other via natural language (just as people do). In FACA, robots balance safety with agility via a novel artificial potential field algorithm that creates an automatic ``roundabout'' effect whenever a conflict arises. Our experiments show that FACA achieves a improvement in efficiency, completing missions more than 3.5X faster than baselines with a time reduction of over 70% while maintaining robust safety margins."
