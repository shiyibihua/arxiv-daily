      "summary": "Despite the rise of billion-parameter foundation models trained across thousands of GPUs, similar scaling gains have not been shown for humanoid control. Current neural controllers for humanoids remain modest in size, target a limited behavior set, and are trained on a handful of GPUs over several days. We show that scaling up model capacity, data, and compute yields a generalist humanoid controller capable of creating natural and robust whole-body movements. Specifically, we posit motion tracking as a natural and scalable task for humanoid control, leverageing dense supervision from diverse motion-capture data to acquire human motion priors without manual reward engineering. We build a foundation model for motion tracking by scaling along three axes: network size (from 1.2M to 42M parameters), dataset volume (over 100M frames, 700 hours of high-quality motion data), and compute (9k GPU hours). Beyond demonstrating the benefits of scale, we show the practical utility of our model through two mechanisms: (1) a real-time universal kinematic planner that bridges motion tracking to downstream task execution, enabling natural and interactive control, and (2) a unified token space that supports various motion input interfaces, such as VR teleoperation devices, human videos, and vision-language-action (VLA) models, all using the same policy. Scaling motion tracking exhibits favorable properties: performance improves steadily with increased compute and data diversity, and learned representations generalize to unseen motions, establishing motion tracking at scale as a practical foundation for humanoid control."

      "summary": "This paper presents a novel image-based path planning algorithm that was developed using computer vision techniques, as well as its comparative analysis with well-known deterministic and probabilistic algorithms, namely A* and Probabilistic Road Map algorithm (PRM). The terrain depth has a significant impact on the calculated path safety. The craters and hills on the surface cannot be distinguished in a two-dimensional image. The proposed method uses a disparity map of the terrain that is generated by using a UAV. Several computer vision techniques, including edge, line and corner detection methods, as well as the stereo depth reconstruction technique, are applied to the captured images and the found disparity map is used to define candidate way-points of the trajectory. The initial and desired points are detected automatically using ArUco marker pose estimation and circle detection techniques. After presenting the mathematical model and vision techniques, the developed algorithm is compared with well-known algorithms on different virtual scenes created in the V-REP simulation program and a physical setup created in a laboratory environment. Results are promising and demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

      "summary": "Can we turn a video prediction model into a robot policy? Videos, including those of humans or teleoperated robots, capture rich physical interactions. However, most of them lack labeled actions, which limits their use in robot learning. We present Video Prediction for Robot Actions (ViPRA), a simple pretraining-finetuning framework that learns continuous robot control from these actionless videos. Instead of directly predicting actions, we train a video-language model to predict both future visual observations and motion-centric latent actions, which serve as intermediate representations of scene dynamics. We train these latent actions using perceptual losses and optical flow consistency to ensure they reflect physically grounded behavior. For downstream control, we introduce a chunked flow matching decoder that maps latent actions to robot-specific continuous action sequences, using only 100 to 200 teleoperated demonstrations. This approach avoids expensive action annotation, supports generalization across embodiments, and enables smooth, high-frequency continuous control upto 22 Hz via chunked action decoding. Unlike prior latent action works that treat pretraining as autoregressive policy learning, explicitly models both what changes and how. Our method outperforms strong baselines, with a 16% gain on the SIMPLER benchmark and a 13% improvement across real world manipulation tasks. We will release models and code at https://vipra-project.github.io"

Here, we propose a tactile-encoded BCI that leverages sensory afferents through a novel tactile-evoked P300 paradigm, allowing intuitive and reliable decoding of supernumerary motor intentions even when superimposed with voluntary actions. The interface was evaluated in a multi-day experiment comprising of a single motor recognition task to validate baseline BCI performance and a dual task paradigm to assess the potential influence between the BCI and natural human movement. The brain interface achieved real-time and reliable decoding of four supernumerary degrees of freedom, with significant performance improvements after only three days of training. Importantly, after training, performance did not differ significantly between the single- and dual-BCI task conditions, and natural movement remained unimpaired during concurrent supernumerary control. Lastly, the interface was deployed in a movement augmentation task, demonstrating its ability to command two supernumerary robotic arms for functional assistance during bimanual tasks. These results establish a new neural interface paradigm for movement augmentation through stimulation of sensory afferents, expanding motor degrees of freedom without impairing natural movement."

      "summary": "Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE) have emerged as a highly effective technique for one-dimensional sequences in Natural Language Processing spurring recent progress towards generalizing RoPE to higher-dimensional data such as images and videos. The success of RoPE has been thought to be due to its positional equivariance, i.e. its status as a relative positional encoding. In this paper, we mathematically show RoPE to be one of the most general solutions for equivariant positional embedding in one-dimensional data. Moreover, we show Mixed RoPE to be the analogously general solution for M-dimensional data, if we require commutative generators -- a property necessary for RoPE's equivariance. However, we question whether strict equivariance plays a large role in RoPE's performance. We propose Spherical RoPE, a method analogous to Mixed RoPE, but assumes non-commutative generators. Empirically, we find Spherical RoPE to have the equivalent or better learning behavior compared to its equivariant analogues. This suggests that relative positional embeddings are not as important as is commonly believed, at least within computer vision. We expect this discovery to facilitate future work in positional encodings for vision that can be faster and generalize better by removing the preconception that they must be relative."

      "summary": "Physiological motion can affect the diagnostic quality of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While various retrospective motion correction methods exist, many struggle to generalize across different motion types and body regions. In particular, machine learning (ML)-based corrections are often tailored to specific applications and datasets. We hypothesize that motion artifacts, though diverse, share underlying patterns that can be disentangled and exploited. To address this, we propose a hierarchical vector-quantized (VQ) variational auto-encoder that learns a disentangled embedding of motion-to-clean image features. A codebook is deployed to capture finite collection of motion patterns at multiple resolutions, enabling coarse-to-fine correction. An auto-regressive model is trained to learn the prior distribution of motion-free images and is used at inference to guide the correction process. Unlike conventional approaches, our method does not require artifact-specific training and can generalize to unseen motion patterns. We demonstrate the approach on simulated whole-body motion artifacts and observe robust correction across varying motion severity. Our results suggest that the model effectively disentangled physical motion of the simulated motion-effective scans, therefore, improving the generalizability of the ML-based MRI motion correction. Our work of disentangling the motion features shed a light on its potential application across anatomical regions and motion types."

However, sEMG-based systems often suffer from the scarcity of informative training data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization in deep learning models. Data augmentation offers a promising approach to increasing the size and diversity of training data, where faithfulness and diversity are two critical factors to effectiveness. However, promoting untargeted diversity can result in redundant samples with limited utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion-based data augmentation approach, Sparse-Aware Semantic-Guided Diffusion Augmentation (SASG-DA). To enhance generation faithfulness, we introduce the Semantic Representation Guidance (SRG) mechanism by leveraging fine-grained, task-aware semantic representations as generation conditions. To enable flexible and diverse sample generation, we propose a Gaussian Modeling Semantic Modeling (GMSS) strategy, which models the semantic representation distribution and allows stochastic sampling to produce both faithful and diverse samples. To enhance targeted diversity, we further introduce a Sparse-Aware Semantic Sampling strategy to explicitly explore underrepresented regions, improving distribution coverage and sample utility. Extensive experiments on benchmark sEMG datasets, Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB7, demonstrate that SASG-DA significantly outperforms existing augmentation methods. Overall, our proposed data augmentation approach effectively mitigates overfitting and improves recognition performance and generalization by offering both faithful and diverse samples."

      "summary": "Semantic segmentation has achieved great success in ideal conditions. However, when facing extreme conditions (e.g., insufficient light, fierce camera motion), most existing methods suffer from significant information loss of RGB, severely damaging segmentation results. Several researches exploit the high-speed and high-dynamic event modality as a complement, but event and RGB are naturally heterogeneous, which leads to feature-level mismatch and inferior optimization of existing multi-modality methods. Different from these researches, we delve into the edge secret of both modalities for resilient fusion and propose a novel Edge-awareness Semantic Concordance framework to unify the multi-modality heterogeneous features with latent edge cues. In this framework, we first propose Edge-awareness Latent Re-coding, which obtains uncertainty indicators while realigning event-RGB features into unified semantic space guided by re-coded distribution, and transfers event-RGB distributions into re-coded features by utilizing a pre-established edge dictionary as clues. We then propose Re-coded Consolidation and Uncertainty Optimization, which utilize re-coded edge features and uncertainty indicators to solve the heterogeneous event-RGB fusion issues under extreme conditions. We establish two synthetic and one real-world event-RGB semantic segmentation datasets for extreme scenario comparisons. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by a 2.55% mIoU on our proposed DERS-XS, and possesses superior resilience under spatial occlusion.

      "summary": "Point cloud processing has become a cornerstone technology in many 3D vision tasks. However, arbitrary rotations introduce variations in point cloud orientations, posing a long-standing challenge for effective representation learning. The core of this issue is the disruption of the point cloud's intrinsic directional characteristics caused by rotational perturbations. Recent methods attempt to implicitly model rotational equivariance and invariance, preserving directional information and propagating it into deep semantic spaces. Yet, they often fall short of fully exploiting the multiscale directional nature of point clouds to enhance feature representations. To address this, we propose the Direction-Perceptive Vector Network (DiPVNet). At its core is an atomic dot-product operator that simultaneously encodes directional selectivity and rotation invariance--endowing the network with both rotational symmetry modeling and adaptive directional perception. At the local level, we introduce a Learnable Local Dot-Product (L2DP) Operator, which enables interactions between a center point and its neighbors to adaptively capture the non-uniform local structures of point clouds. At the global level, we leverage generalized harmonic analysis to prove that the dot-product between point clouds and spherical sampling vectors is equivalent to a direction-aware spherical Fourier transform (DASFT). This leads to the construction of a global directional response spectrum for modeling holistic directional structures. We rigorously prove the rotation invariance of both operators. Extensive experiments on challenging scenarios involving noise and large-angle rotations demonstrate that DiPVNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on point cloud classification and segmentation tasks.

While textual context often highlights semantic relationships within an image, existing fine-tuning methods typically overlook this information when aligning vision and language, thus leading to suboptimal performance. Toward solving this problem, we propose a method that can improve multimodal alignment and fusion based on both semantics and relationships.Specifically, we first extract multilevel semantic features from different vision encoder to capture more visual cues of the relationships. Then, we learn to project the vision features to group related semantics, among which are more likely to have relationships. Finally, we fuse the visual features with the textual by using inheritable cross-attention, where we globally remove the redundant visual relationships by discarding visual-language feature pairs with low correlation. We evaluate our proposed method on eight foundation models and two downstream tasks, visual question answering and image captioning, and show that it outperforms all existing methods."

With the ever-increasing incorporation of these data-driven models into the estimation domain, model predictions with reliable margins of error are a requirement -- especially for safety-critical applications. This paper discusses the application of a novel real-time, data-driven estimation approach based on the multi-fidelity residual physics-informed neural process (MFR-PINP) toward the real-time state estimation of a robotic system. Specifically, we address the model-mismatch issue of selecting an accurate kinematic model by tasking the MFR-PINP to also learn the residuals between simple, low-fidelity predictions and complex, high-fidelity ground-truth dynamics. To account for model uncertainty present in a physical implementation, robust uncertainty guarantees from the split conformal (SC) prediction framework are modeled in the training and inference paradigms. We provide implementation details of our MFR-PINP-based estimator for a hybrid online learning setting to validate our model's usage in real-time applications. Experimental results of our approach's performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art variants of the Kalman filter (i.e. unscented Kalman filter and deep Kalman filter) in estimation scenarios showed promising results for the MFR-PINP model as a viable option in real-time estimation tasks."

      "summary": "In order to achieve Continual Learning (CL), the problem of catastrophic forgetting, one that has plagued neural networks since their inception, must be overcome. The evaluation of continual learning methods relies on splitting a known homogeneous dataset and learning the associated tasks one after the other. We argue that most CL methods introduce a priori information about the data to come and cannot be considered agnostic. We exemplify this point with the case of methods relying on pretrained feature extractors, which are still used in CL. After showing that pretrained feature extractors imply a loss of generality with respect to the data that can be learned by the model, we then discuss other kinds of a priori information introduced in other CL methods. We then present the Online Patch Redundancy Eliminator (OPRE), an online dataset compression algorithm, which, along with the training of a classifier at test time, yields performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 superior to a number of other state-of-the-art online continual learning methods. Additionally, OPRE requires only minimal and interpretable hypothesis on the data to come. We suggest that online dataset compression could well be necessary to achieve fully agnostic CL."

The core objective is to evaluate the trade-offs between visual classification accuracy, model efficiency, and the quality of generative output (nutritional data and recipes). We benchmark this pipeline against alternative vision backbones (VGG-16, ResNet-50, YOLOv8) and a lightweight LLM (Gemma). We introduce a formalization for \"Semantic Error Propagation\" (SEP) to analyze how classification inaccuracies from the visual module cascade into the generative output. Our analysis is grounded in a new Custom Chinese Food Dataset (CCFD) developed to address cultural bias in public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that while EfficientNet-B4 (89.0\\% Top-1 Acc.) provides the best balance of accuracy and efficiency, and Gemini (9.2/10 Factual Accuracy) provides superior generative quality, the system's overall utility is fundamentally bottlenecked by the visual front-end's perceptive accuracy.

However, existing morph generation methods often produce images that are blurry, riddled with artifacts, or poorly constructed making them easy to detect and not representative of the most dangerous attacks. In this work, we introduce StableMorph, a novel approach that generates highly realistic, artifact-free morphed face images using modern diffusion-based image synthesis. Unlike prior methods, StableMorph produces full-head images with sharp details, avoids common visual flaws, and offers unmatched control over visual attributes. Through extensive evaluation, we show that StableMorph images not only rival or exceed the quality of genuine face images but also maintain a strong ability to fool face recognition systems posing a greater challenge to existing MAD solutions and setting a new standard for morph quality in research and operational testing. StableMorph improves the evaluation of biometric security by creating more realistic and effective attacks and supports the development of more robust detection systems."

Existing metrics rely on global embeddings or coarse VLM prompting, failing to capture fine-grained identity changes and providing limited diagnostic insight. We introduce Beyond the Pixels, a hierarchical evaluation framework that decomposes identity assessment into feature-level transformations. Our approach guides VLMs through structured reasoning by (1) hierarchically decomposing subjects into (type, style) -> attribute -> feature decision tree, and (2) prompting for concrete transformations rather than abstract similarity scores. This decomposition grounds VLM analysis in verifiable visual evidence, reducing hallucinations and improving consistency. We validate our framework across four state-of-the-art generative models, demonstrating strong alignment with human judgments in measuring identity consistency. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark specifically designed to stress-test generative models. It comprises 1,078 image-prompt pairs spanning diverse subject types, including underrepresented categories such as anthropomorphic and animated characters, and captures an average of six to seven transformation axes per prompt."

This approach enables robust identity preservation without architectural modifications. To facilitate large-scale training, we introduce a two-stage Distilled Data Curation Framework: the first stage leverages data restoration and VLM-based filtering to create a compact, high-quality seed dataset from diverse sources; the second stage utilizes these curated examples for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, thus scaling the generation capability across various subjects and contexts.

Because of these ad-hoc solutions, existing counters struggle with images containing diverse-sized objects and densely populated regions of small objects. We propose GECO2, an end-to-end few-shot counting and detection method that explicitly addresses the object scale issues. A new dense query representation gradually aggregates exemplar-specific feature information across scales that leads to high-resolution dense queries that enable detection of large as well as small objects. GECO2 surpasses state-of-the-art few-shot counters in counting as well as detection accuracy by 10% while running 3x times faster at smaller GPU memory footprint."

This motivated Imaginary Supervised Object Detection (ISOD), where models train on synthetic images and test on real images. However, existing methods face three limitations: (1) synthetic datasets suffer from simplistic prompts, poor image quality, and weak supervision; (2) DETR-based detectors, due to their random query initialization, struggle with slow convergence and overfitting to synthetic patterns, hindering real-world generalization; (3) uniform denoising pressure promotes model overfitting to pseudo-label noise. We propose Cascade HQP-DETR to address these limitations. First, we introduce a high-quality data pipeline using LLaMA-3, Flux, and Grounding DINO to generate the FluxVOC and FluxCOCO datasets, advancing ISOD from weak to full supervision. Second, our High-Quality Proposal guided query encoding initializes object queries with image-specific priors from SAM-generated proposals and RoI-pooled features, accelerating convergence while steering the model to learn transferable features instead of overfitting to synthetic patterns. Third, our cascade denoising algorithm dynamically adjusts training weights through progressively increasing IoU thresholds across decoder layers, guiding the model to learn robust boundaries from reliable visual cues rather than overfitting to noisy labels. Trained for just 12 epochs solely on FluxVOC, Cascade HQP-DETR achieves a SOTA 61.04\\% mAP@0.5 on PASCAL VOC 2007, outperforming strong baselines, with its competitive real-data performance confirming the architecture's universal applicability."

Visual 3D detection based on RGB cameras provides a cost-effective solution compared to the LiDAR paradigm. While achieving promising detection accuracy, current deep neural network-based models remain highly susceptible to adversarial examples. The underlying safety concerns motivate us to investigate realistic adversarial attacks in AD scenarios. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of placing adversarial posters on the road surface to induce hallucinations in the detector. However, the unnatural appearance of the posters makes them easily noticeable by humans, and their fixed content can be readily targeted and defended. To address these limitations, we propose the AdvRoad to generate diverse road-style adversarial posters. The adversaries have naturalistic appearances resembling the road surface while compromising the detector to perceive non-existent objects at the attack locations. We employ a two-stage approach, termed Road-Style Adversary Generation and Scenario-Associated Adaptation, to maximize the attack effectiveness on the input scene while ensuring the natural appearance of the poster, allowing the attack to be carried out stealthily without drawing human attention. Extensive experiments show that AdvRoad generalizes well to different detectors, scenes, and spoofing locations. Moreover, physical attacks further demonstrate the practical threats in real-world environments."

This work presents an optimized, low-power edge AI system for weeds detection based on the YOLOv8n object detector deployed on the STM32U575ZI microcontroller. Several compression techniques are applied to the detection model, including structured pruning, integer quantization and input image resolution scaling in order to meet strict hardware constraints. The model is trained and evaluated on the CropAndWeed dataset with 74 plant species, achieving a balanced trade-off between detection accuracy and efficiency. Our system supports real-time, in-situ weeds detection with a minimal energy consumption of 51.8mJ per inference, enabling scalable deployment in power-constrained agricultural environments."

While modern convolutional and transformer-based models perform well on aligned data, their reliance on precise co-registration limits their robustness in real-world conditions. Existing joint registration-detection frameworks typically require retraining and transfer poorly across domains. We introduce a modular pipeline that improves spatial and temporal robustness without altering existing change detection networks. The framework integrates diffusion-based semantic morphing, dense registration, and residual flow refinement. A diffusion module synthesizes intermediate morphing frames that bridge large appearance gaps, enabling RoMa to estimate stepwise correspondences between consecutive frames. The composed flow is then refined through a lightweight U-Net to produce a high-fidelity warp that co-registers the original image pair. Extensive experiments on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and DSIFN-CD show consistent gains in both registration accuracy and downstream change detection across multiple backbones, demonstrating the generality and effectiveness of the proposed approach."

Currently, TFG methods based on Neural Radiated Field (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian sputtering (3DGS) are received widespread attention. They learn and store personalized features from reference videos of each target individual to generate realistic speaking videos. To ensure models can capture sufficient 3D information and successfully learns the lip-audio mapping, previous studies usually require meticulous processing and fitting several minutes of reference video, which always takes hours. The computational burden of processing and fitting long reference videos severely limits the practical application value of these methods.However, is it really necessary to fit such minutes of reference video? Our exploratory case studies show that using some informative reference video segments of just a few seconds can achieve performance comparable to or even better than the full reference video. This indicates that video informative quality is much more important than its length. Inspired by this observation, we propose the ISExplore (short for Informative Segment Explore), a simple-yet-effective segment selection strategy that automatically identifies the informative 5-second reference video segment based on three key data quality dimensions: audio feature diversity, lip movement amplitude, and number of camera views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach increases data processing and training speed by more than 5x for NeRF and 3DGS methods, while maintaining high-fidelity output.

Existing SSC methods have shown efficacy in improving 3D scene representations, but suffer from the inherent input-output dimension gap and annotation-reality density gap, where the 2D planner view from input images with sparse annotated labels leads to inferior prediction of real-world dense occupancy with a 3D stereoscopic view. In light of this, we propose the corresponding High-Dimension High-Density Semantic Scene Completion (HD$^2$-SSC) framework with expanded pixel semantics and refined voxel occupancies. To bridge the dimension gap, a High-dimension Semantic Decoupling module is designed to expand 2D image features along a pseudo third dimension, decoupling coarse pixel semantics from occlusions, and then identify focal regions with fine semantics to enrich image features. To mitigate the density gap, a High-density Occupancy Refinement module is devised with a \"detect-and-refine\" architecture to leverage contextual geometric and semantic structures for enhanced semantic density with the completion of missing voxels and correction of erroneous ones. Extensive experiments and analyses on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets validate the effectiveness of our HD$^2$-SSC framework."

Model-based locomotion approaches typically adopt heuristic methods or planning based on the linear inverted pendulum model. These methods account for linear velocity in footstep planning, while excluding angular velocity, which leads to angular momentum being handled exclusively via ground reaction force (GRF). Footstep planning based on MPC that takes angular velocity into account recasts the angular momentum control problem as a dual-input approach that coordinates GRFs and footstep placement, instead of optimizing GRFs alone, thereby improving tracking performance. A mutual-feedback loop couples the footstep planner and the GRF MPC, with each using the other's solution to iteratively update footsteps and GRFs. The use of optimal solutions reduces body oscillation and enables extended stance and swing phases. The method is validated on a quadruped robot, demonstrating robust locomotion with reduced oscillations, longer stance and swing phases across various terrains."

Text polarity is defined as the contrast of text with respect to background. That means, text is darker than the background (dark text on bright background) or vice-versa. The binarization process uses this polarity information to convert the original colour or gray scale image into a binary image. In the literature, there is an intuitive approach based on power-law transformation on the original images. In this approach, the authors have illustrated an interesting phenomenon from the histogram statistics of the transformed images. Considering text and background as two classes, they have observed that maximum between-class variance between two classes is increasing (decreasing) for dark (bright) text on bright (dark) background. The corresponding empirical results have been presented. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of the above phenomenon."

The UAV is modeled as a variable-speed Dubins vehicle with a line-of-sight sensor in an urban environment that may occlude the sensor's view of the POI. A search strategy is proposed that exploits a probabilistic visibility volume (VV) to plan its future motion with iterative deepening $A^\\ast$. The probabilistic VV is a time-varying three-dimensional representation of the sensing constraints for a particular distribution of the POI's state. To find the path most likely to view the POI, the planner uses a heuristic to optimistically estimate the probability of viewing the POI over a time horizon. The probabilistic VV is max-pooled to create a variable-timestep planner that reduces the search space and balances long-term and short-term planning. The proposed path planning method is compared to prior work with a Monte-Carlo simulation and is shown to outperform the baseline methods in cluttered environments when the UAV's sensor has a higher false alarm probability."

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework for human preference alignment in diffusion models (PC-Diffusion), using a lightweight, trainable Preference Classifier that directly models the relative preference between samples. By restricting preference learning to this classifier, PC-Diffusion decouples preference alignment from the generative model, eliminating the need for entire model fine-tuning and reference model reliance.~We further provide theoretical guarantees for PC-Diffusion:1) PC-Diffusion ensures that the preference-guided distributions are consistently propagated across timesteps. 2)The training objective of the preference classifier is equivalent to DPO, but does not require a reference model.3) The proposed preference-guided correction can progressively steer generation toward preference-aligned regions.~Empirical results show that PC-Diffusion achieves comparable preference consistency to DPO while significantly reducing training costs and enabling efficient and stable preference-guided generation."

Specifically, this paper first conducts a comprehensive analysis of the impact of random noise on the model's generation. We found that noise not only contains rich semantic information, but also allows for the erasure of unwanted semantics from it in an extremely simple way based on information theory, and using the equivalence between the generation process of diffusion model and semantic injection to inject semantics into the cleaned noise. Then, we mathematically decipher these observations and propose a simple but efficient training-free and universal two-step \"Semantic Erasure-Injection\" process to modulate the initial noise in T2C diffusion model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is consistently effective across various T2C models based on both DiT and UNet architectures and presents a novel perspective for optimizing the generation of diffusion model, providing a universal tool for consistent generation."

      "summary": "Developing efficient and accurate visuomotor policies poses a central challenge in robotic imitation learning. While recent rectified flow approaches have advanced visuomotor policy learning, they suffer from a key limitation: After iterative distillation, generated actions may deviate from the ground-truth actions corresponding to the current visual observation, leading to accumulated error as the reflow process repeats and unstable task execution. We present Selective Flow Alignment (SeFA), an efficient and accurate visuomotor policy learning framework. SeFA resolves this challenge by a selective flow alignment strategy, which leverages expert demonstrations to selectively correct generated actions and restore consistency with observations, while preserving multimodality. This design introduces a consistency correction mechanism that ensures generated actions remain observation-aligned without sacrificing the efficiency of one-step flow inference. Extensive experiments across both simulated and real-world manipulation tasks show that SeFA Policy surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and flow-based policies, achieving superior accuracy and robustness while reducing inference latency by over 98%. By unifying rectified flow efficiency with observation-consistent action generation, SeFA provides a scalable and dependable solution for real-time visuomotor policy learning.

While Transformer-based methods have successfully addressed some limitations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as their local processing nature and information loss resulting from convolution and downsampling operations, they still face the scalability issue due to the quadratic increase in memory and computational requirements with the length of the input sequence. To overcome this, we propose a pure Mamba-based person ReID framework named ReIDMamba. Specifically, we have designed a Mamba-based strong baseline that effectively leverages fine-grained, discriminative global features by introducing multiple class tokens. To further enhance robust features learning within Mamba, we have carefully designed two novel techniques. First, the multi-granularity feature extractor (MGFE) module, designed with a multi-branch architecture and class token fusion, effectively forms multi-granularity features, enhancing both discrimination ability and fine-grained coverage. Second, the ranking-aware triplet regularization (RATR) is introduced to reduce redundancy in features from multiple branches, enhancing the diversity of multi-granularity features by incorporating both intra-class and inter-class diversity constraints, thus ensuring the robustness of person features. To our knowledge, this is the pioneering work that integrates a purely Mamba-driven approach into ReID research. Our proposed ReIDMamba model boasts only one-third the parameters of TransReID, along with lower GPU memory usage and faster inference throughput. Experimental results demonstrate ReIDMamba's superior and promising performance, achieving state-of-the-art performance on five person ReID benchmarks.

      "summary": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a promising direction in computational pathology, the substantial computational cost of giga-pixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) necessitates the use of Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) to enable effective modeling. A key challenge is that pathological tasks typically provide only bag-level labels, while instance-level descriptions generated by LLMs often suffer from bias due to a lack of fine-grained medical knowledge. To address this, we propose that constructing task-specific pathological entity prototypes is crucial for learning generalizable features and enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, existing vision-language MIL methods often employ unidirectional guidance, limiting cross-modal synergy. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Multimodal Prototype-based Multi-Instance Learning, that promotes bidirectional interaction through a balanced information compression scheme. Specifically, we leverage a frozen LLM to generate task-specific pathological entity descriptions, which are learned as text prototypes. Concurrently, the vision branch learns instance-level prototypes to mitigate the model's reliance on redundant data. For the fusion stage, we employ the Stereoscopic Optimal Transport (SOT) algorithm, which is based on a similarity metric, thereby facilitating broader semantic alignment in a higher-dimensional space. We conduct few-shot classification and explainability experiments on three distinct cancer datasets, and the results demonstrate the superior generalization capabilities of our proposed method."

Most CD models assume co-registered inputs, yet real-world imagery often exhibits parallax, viewpoint shifts, and long temporal gaps that cause severe misalignment. Traditional two stage methods that first register and then detect, as well as recent joint frameworks (e.g., BiFA, ChangeRD), still struggle under large displacements, relying on regression only flow, global homographies, or synthetic perturbations. We present DiffRegCD, an integrated framework that unifies dense registration and change detection in a single model. DiffRegCD reformulates correspondence estimation as a Gaussian smoothed classification task, achieving sub-pixel accuracy and stable training. It leverages frozen multi-scale features from a pretrained denoising diffusion model, ensuring robustness to illumination and viewpoint variation. Supervision is provided through controlled affine perturbations applied to standard CD datasets, yielding paired ground truth for both flow and change detection without pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on aerial (LEVIR-CD, DSIFN-CD, WHU-CD, SYSU-CD) and ground level (VL-CMU-CD) datasets show that DiffRegCD consistently surpasses recent baselines and remains reliable under wide temporal and geometric variation, establishing diffusion features and classification based correspondence as a strong foundation for unified change detection."

Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental method for formally verifying safety and generating safe controllers. However, computing the HJ value function that characterizes the backward reachable set (BRS) of a set of user-defined failure states is computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional systems, motivating the use of reinforcement learning approaches to approximate the value function. Unfortunately, a learned value function and its corresponding safe policy are not guaranteed to be correct. The learned value function evaluated at a given state may not be equal to the actual safety return achieved by following the learned safe policy. To address this challenge, we introduce a conformal prediction-based (CP) framework that bounds such uncertainty. We leverage CP to provide probabilistic safety guarantees when using learned HJ value functions and policies to prevent control systems from reaching failure states. Specifically, we use CP to calibrate the switching between the unsafe nominal controller and the learned HJ-based safe policy and to derive safety guarantees under this switched policy. We also investigate using an ensemble of independently trained HJ value functions as a safety filter and compare this ensemble approach to using individual value functions alone."

We identify key design parameters for mechanical layer jamming systems, including the ability to modulate stiffness, and perform a variety of comprehensive tests placing the specimens under bending and torsional loads to understand the influence of our selected design parameters (mainly tooth geometry) on the performance of the jammed structures. We note the ability of these structures to produce a peak change in stiffness of 5 times in bending and 3.2 times in torsion. We also measure the force required to separate the two jammed layers, an often ignored parameter in the study of jamming-induced stiffness change. This study aims to shed light on the principled design of mechanical layer jammed systems and guide researchers in the selection of appropriate designs for their specific application domains."

Despite some interesting progress, related work still suffers from imperfect point cloud serialization, insufficient high-level geometric perception, and overfitting of the selective state space model (S6) at the core of Mamba. To this end, we resort to an SSM-based point cloud network termed CloudMamba to address the above challenges. Specifically, we propose sequence expanding and sequence merging, where the former serializes points along each axis separately and the latter serves to fuse the corresponding higher-order features causally inferred from different sequences, enabling unordered point sets to adapt more stably to the causal nature of Mamba without parameters. Meanwhile, we design chainedMamba that chains the forward and backward processes in the parallel bidirectional Mamba, capturing high-level geometric information during scanning. In addition, we propose a grouped selective state space model (GS6) via parameter sharing on S6, alleviating the overfitting problem caused by the computational mode in S6. Experiments on various point cloud tasks validate CloudMamba's ability to achieve state-of-the-art results with significantly less complexity."

We demonstrate that CDI$^s$ integration reliably enhances or preserves segmentation performance in 94% of evaluated configurations, with individual architectures achieving up to 72.5% statistically significant relative improvement over baseline modalities. CDI$^s$ + DWI emerges as the safest enhancement pathway, achieving significant improvements in half of evaluated architectures with zero instances of degradation. Since CDI$^s$ derives from existing DWI acquisitions without requiring additional scan time or architectural modifications, it enables immediate deployment in clinical workflows. Our results establish validated integration pathways for CDI$^s$ as a practical drop-in enhancement for PCa lesion segmentation tasks across diverse deep learning architectures."

This discrepancy significantly hinders the performance of MLLM-based IQA methods. Previous approaches that convert discrete token predictions into continuous scores often suffer from conversion errors. Moreover, the semantic confusion introduced by level tokens (e.g., ``good'') further constrains the performance of MLLMs on IQA tasks and degrades their original capabilities for related tasks. To tackle these problems, we provide a theoretical analysis of the errors inherent in previous approaches and, motivated by this analysis, propose a simple yet effective framework, Q-Scorer. This framework incorporates a lightweight regression module and IQA-specific score tokens into the MLLM pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Scorer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple IQA benchmarks, generalizes well to mixed datasets, and further improves when combined with other methods."

Specifically, a Dynamic Instance and Contour Consistency Contrastive Learning (DI3CL) pre-training framework is presented, which incorporates a Dynamic Instance (DI) module and a Contour Consistency (CC) module. DI module enhances global contextual awareness by enforcing local consistency across different views of the same region. CC module leverages shallow feature maps to guide the model to focus on the geometric contours of SAR land-cover objects, thereby improving structural discrimination. Additionally, to enhance robustness and generalization during pre-training, a large-scale and diverse dataset named SARSense, comprising 460,532 SAR images, is constructed to enable the model to capture comprehensive and representative features. To evaluate the generalization capability of our foundation model, we conducted extensive experiments across a variety of SAR land-cover classification tasks, including SAR land-cover mapping, water body detection, and road extraction.

In the training stage, to tackle feature entanglement that impedes cross-domain generalization and rapid adaptation, we propose the Adversarial-Contrastive Feature Decomposition (ACFD) module. It decouples backbone features into category-relevant private and domain-relevant shared representations via contrastive learning and adversarial learning. Then, to mitigate the potential degradation caused by the disentanglement, the Matrix-Guided Dynamic Fusion (MGDF) module adaptively integrates base, shared, and private features under spatial guidance, maintaining structural coherence. In addition, in the fine-tuning stage, to enhanced model generalization, the Cross-Adaptive Modulation (CAM) module is placed before the MGDF, where shared features guide private features via modulation ensuring effective integration of domain-relevant information. Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets show that DCDNet outperforms existing CD-FSS methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for cross-domain generalization and few-shot adaptation."

To overcome these limitations, we propose OmniAID, a novel framework centered on a decoupled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. The core of our method is a hybrid expert system engineered to decouple: (1) semantic flaws across distinct content domains, and (2) these content-dependent flaws from content-agnostic universal artifacts. This system employs a set of Routable Specialized Semantic Experts, each for a distinct domain (e.g., human, animal), complemented by a Fixed Universal Artifact Expert. This architecture is trained using a bespoke two-stage strategy: we first train the experts independently with domain-specific hard-sampling to ensure specialization, and subsequently train a lightweight gating network for effective input routing. By explicitly decoupling \"what is generated\" (content-specific flaws) from \"how it is generated\" (universal artifacts), OmniAID achieves robust generalization. To address outdated benchmarks and validate real-world applicability, we introduce Mirage, a new large-scale, contemporary dataset. Extensive experiments, using both traditional benchmarks and our Mirage dataset, demonstrate our model surpasses existing monolithic detectors, establishing a new, robust standard for AIGI authentication against modern, in-the-wild threats."

The unpredictable evolution of state variables poses a significant challenge for meeting predefined constraints using various control methods. To address this, we present a new algorithm that computes safe policies to determine the safety level across a finite state set. This algorithm reduces the safety objective to the standard average reward Markov Decision Process (MDP) objective. This reduction enables us to use standard techniques, such as linear programs, to compute and analyze safe policies. We validate the proposed method numerically on the Double Integrator and the Inverted Pendulum systems. Results indicate that the average-reward MDPs solution is more comprehensive, converges faster, and offers higher quality compared to the minimum discounted-reward solution."

We introduce Top2Ground, a novel diffusion-based method that directly generates photorealistic ground-view images from aerial input images without relying on intermediate representations such as depth maps or 3D voxels. Specifically, we condition the denoising process on a joint representation of VAE-encoded spatial features (derived from aerial RGB images and an estimated height map) and CLIP-based semantic embeddings. This design ensures the generation is both geometrically constrained by the scene's 3D structure and semantically consistent with its content. We evaluate Top2Ground on three diverse datasets: CVUSA, CVACT, and the Auto Arborist. Our approach shows 7.3% average improvement in SSIM across three benchmark datasets, showing Top2Ground can robustly handle both wide and narrow fields of view, highlighting its strong generalization capabilities."

Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment (FR-IQA) methods fail under misalignment, while No-Reference (NR-IQA) methods struggle with generalization. In this work, we introduce a Non-Aligned Reference (NAR-IQA) framework tailored for NVS, where it is assumed that the reference view shares partial scene content but lacks pixel-level alignment. We constructed a large-scale image dataset containing synthetic distortions targeting Temporal Regions of Interest (TROI) to train our NAR-IQA model. Our model is built on a contrastive learning framework that incorporates LoRA-enhanced DINOv2 embeddings and is guided by supervision from existing IQA methods. We train exclusively on synthetically generated distortions, deliberately avoiding overfitting to specific real NVS samples and thereby enhancing the model's generalization capability. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art FR-IQA, NR-IQA, and NAR-IQA methods, achieving robust performance on both aligned and non-aligned references. We also conducted a novel user study to gather data on human preferences when viewing non-aligned references in NVS. We find strong correlation between our proposed quality prediction model and the collected subjective ratings.

This study evaluates whether explicitly incorporating diverse points of view using the ReAct framework, an approach that integrates reasoning and acting, can enhance an LLM's ability to understand and ground the demands of other agents. We extend the classic Director task by introducing active visual exploration across a suite of seven scenarios of increasing perspective-taking complexity. These scenarios are designed to challenge the agent's capacity to resolve referential ambiguity based on visual access and interaction, under varying state representations and prompting strategies, including ReAct-style reasoning. Our results demonstrate that explicit perspective cues, combined with active exploration strategies, significantly improve the model's interpretative accuracy and collaborative effectiveness. These findings highlight the potential of integrating active perception with perspective-taking mechanisms in advancing LLMs' application in robotics and multi-agent systems, setting a foundation for future research into adaptive and context-aware AI systems."

Recent work suggests that the underlying causal graphs of such dynamics models are sparsely connected, with each of the future state variables depending only on a small subset of the current state variables, and that learning may therefore benefit from sparsity priors. Similarly, temporal sparsity, i.e. sparsely and abruptly changing local dynamics, has also been proposed as a useful inductive bias.\n  In this work, we critically examine these assumptions by analyzing ground-truth dynamics from a set of robotic reinforcement learning environments in the MuJoCo Playground benchmark suite, aiming to determine whether the proposed notions of state and temporal sparsity actually tend to hold in typical reinforcement learning tasks.\n  We study (i) whether the causal graphs of environment dynamics are sparse, (ii) whether such sparsity is state-dependent, and (iii) whether local system dynamics change sparsely.\n  Our results indicate that global sparsity is rare, but instead the tasks show local, state-dependent sparsity in their dynamics and this sparsity exhibits distinct structures, appearing in temporally localized clusters (e.g., during contact events) and affecting specific subsets of state dimensions. These findings challenge common sparsity prior assumptions in dynamics learning, emphasizing the need for grounded inductive biases that reflect the state-dependent sparsity structure of real-world dynamics."

Next, we use DREAMPlace to build a mixed-size placement prototype and obtain reference positions for each macro and cluster. Based on this prototype, we introduce ABPlace, an angle-based analytical method that optimizes macro positions on an ellipse to distribute macros uniformly near chip periphery, while optimizing wirelength and dataflow. A packing tree-based relocating procedure is then designed to jointly adjust the locations of macro groups and the macros within each group, by optimizing an expertise-inspired cost function that captures various design constraints through evolutionary search. Re$^{\\text{2}}$MaP repeats the above process: Only a subset of macro groups are positioned in each iteration, and the remaining macros are deferred to the next iteration to improve the prototype's accuracy. Using a well-established backend flow with sufficient timing optimizations, Re$^{\\text{2}}$MaP achieves up to 22.22% (average 10.26%) improvement in worst negative slack (WNS) and up to 97.91% (average 33.97%) improvement in total negative slack (TNS) compared to the state-of-the-art academic placer Hier-RTLMP.

While unimodal detection methods have shown progress in identifying synthetic media, their inability to leverage cross-modal correlations and precisely localize forged segments limits their practicality against sophisticated, fine-grained manipulations. To address this, we introduce a multi-modal deepfake detection and localization framework based on a Feature Pyramid-Transformer (FPN-Transformer), addressing critical gaps in cross-modal generalization and temporal boundary regression. The proposed approach utilizes pre-trained self-supervised models (WavLM for audio, CLIP for video) to extract hierarchical temporal features. A multi-scale feature pyramid is constructed through R-TLM blocks with localized attention mechanisms, enabling joint analysis of cross-context temporal dependencies. The dual-branch prediction head simultaneously predicts forgery probabilities and refines temporal offsets of manipulated segments, achieving frame-level localization precision. We evaluate our approach on the test set of the IJCAI'25 DDL-AV benchmark, showing a good performance with a final score of 0.7535 for cross-modal deepfake detection and localization in challenging environments. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and provide a novel way for generalized deepfake detection. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zig-HS/MM-DDL"

For the experiments with a single HAV, we observe that for 99.8% jackknifing was successfully avoided and that 86.7% and 83.4% reach their first and second goals, respectively.

However, they remain inferior to end-to-end (E2E) compression approaches due to the absence of expressive latent representations. On the other hand, E2E methods rely on transmitting latent codes and requiring complex entropy models, leading to increased decoding complexity. Inspired by the normalization strategy in E2E codecs where latents are transformed into Gaussian noise to demonstrate the removal of spatial redundancy, we explore the inverse direction: generating latents directly from Gaussian noise. In this paper, we propose a novel image compression paradigm that reconstructs image-specific latents from a multi-scale Gaussian noise tensor, deterministically generated using a shared random seed. A Gaussian Parameter Prediction (GPP) module estimates the distribution parameters, enabling one-shot latent generation via reparameterization trick. The predicted latent is then passed through a synthesis network to reconstruct the image. Our method eliminates the need to transmit latent codes while preserving latent-based benefits, achieving competitive rate-distortion performance on Kodak and CLIC dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore Gaussian latent generation for learned image compression."

This memory consolidation mechanism, through structured appearance and geometry memory banks, stores high-confidence retrieval samples, effectively supporting both long- and short-term modeling of target appearance variations. This enables precise contour delineation with robust spatial discrimination, leading to significantly improved retrieval accuracy.

Electrostatic film actuators offer several advantages, including thinness, flexibility, lightweight construction, and high open-loop positioning accuracy. However, the actuation stress exhibited by conventional actuators in air still needs improvement, particularly for the widely used three-phase electrode design. To enhance the output performance of actuators, this paper presents a two-layer electrostatic film actuator with an integrated brake. By alternately distributing electrodes on both the top and bottom layers, a smaller effective electrode pitch is achieved under the same fabrication constraints, resulting in an actuation stress of approximately 241~N/m$^2$, representing a 90.5\\% improvement over previous three-phase actuators operating in air. Furthermore, its integrated electrostatic adhesion mechanism enables load retention under braking mode. Several demonstrations, including a tug-of-war between a conventional single-layer actuator and the proposed two-layer actuator, a payload operation, a one-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, and a dual-mode gripper, were conducted to validate the actuator's advantageous capabilities in both actuation and braking modes."

Although it is quite popular to collect point clouds and images simultaneously, little attention has been paid to the usefulness of image data in 3D UDA when training the models. In this paper, we propose an approach named MMAssist that improves the performance of 3D UDA with multi-modal assistance. A method is designed to align 3D features between the source domain and the target domain by using image and text features as bridges. More specifically, we project the ground truth labels or pseudo labels to the images to get a set of 2D bounding boxes. For each 2D box, we extract its image feature from a pre-trained vision backbone. A large vision-language model (LVLM) is adopted to extract the box's text description, and a pre-trained text encoder is used to obtain its text feature. During the training of the model in the source domain and the student model in the target domain, we align the 3D features of the predicted boxes with their corresponding image and text features, and the 3D features and the aligned features are fused with learned weights for the final prediction. The features between the student branch and the teacher branch in the target domain are aligned as well. To enhance the pseudo labels, we use an off-the-shelf 2D object detector to generate 2D bounding boxes from images and estimate their corresponding 3D boxes with the aid of point cloud, and these 3D boxes are combined with the pseudo labels generated by the teacher model. Experimental results show that our approach achieves promising performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in three domain adaptation tasks on three popular 3D object detection datasets.

These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a \"window\" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems.

Integrating this functional information present in transcriptomic data with structural data from histopathology images is an active research area with applications in identifying tumor substructures associated with cancer drug resistance. Current histopathology-spatial-transcriptomic region segmentation methods suffer due to either making spatial transcriptomics prominent by using histopathology features just to assist processing spatial transcriptomics data or using vanilla contrastive learning that make histopathology images prominent due to only promoting common features losing functional information. In both extremes, the model gets either lost in the noise of spatial transcriptomics or overly smoothed, losing essential information. Thus, we propose our novel architecture SENCA-st (Shared Encoder with Neighborhood Cross Attention) that preserves the features of both modalities. More importantly, it emphasizes regions that are structurally similar in histopathology but functionally different on spatial transcriptomics using cross-attention.

Furthermore, their implicit volumetric representations differ significantly from the widely adopted polygonal meshes, making rendering and manipulation inefficient in standard 3D software. In this work, we propose a robust framework that reconstructs high-quality, editable 3D meshes directly from multi-view images with noisy extrinsic parameters. Our approach jointly refines camera poses while learning an implicit scene representation that captures fine geometric detail and photorealistic appearance. The resulting meshes are compatible with common 3D graphics and robotics tools, enabling efficient downstream use.

Addressing the critical challenge of data scarcity and heterogeneity, robust data pipeline was first developed to standardize and merge four public datasets (PBC, BCCD, Chula, Sickle Cell) into a unified resource. Then employed a state-of-the-art Faster R-CNN object detection framework, leveraging a ResNet-50-FPN backbone. Comparative training rigorously evaluated a randomly initialized baseline model (Regimen 1) against a Transfer Learning Regimen (Regimen 2), initialized with weights pre-trained on the Microsoft COCO dataset. The results demonstrate that the Transfer Learning approach achieved significantly faster convergence and superior stability, culminating in a final validation loss of 0.08666, a substantial improvement over the baseline. This validated methodology establishes a robust foundation for building high-accuracy, deployable systems for automated hematological diagnosis."

While Integrated Gradients (IG) and related attribution methods have shown promise, applying them directly to WSIs introduces challenges due to their high-resolution nature. These methods capture model decision patterns but may overlook class-discriminative signals that are crucial for distinguishing between tumor subtypes. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Integrated Gradients (CIG), a novel attribution method that enhances interpretability by computing contrastive gradients in logit space. First, CIG highlights class-discriminative regions by comparing feature importance relative to a reference class, offering sharper differentiation between tumor and non-tumor areas. Second, CIG satisfies the axioms of integrated attribution, ensuring consistency and theoretical soundness. Third, we propose two attribution quality metrics, MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC, which measure how predictive information and model confidence evolve with access to salient regions, particularly under weak supervision. We validate CIG across three datasets spanning distinct cancer types: CAMELYON16 (breast cancer metastasis in lymph nodes), TCGA-RCC (renal cell carcinoma), and TCGA-Lung (lung cancer). Experimental results demonstrate that CIG yields more informative attributions both quantitatively, using MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC, and qualitatively, through visualizations that align closely with ground truth tumor regions, underscoring its potential for interpretable and trustworthy WSI-based diagnostics"

Unlike traditional centralized planning methods, our system does not dictate robot paths but instead provides stop commands, functioning as a virtual traffic light.

In this work, we continue on the developed system by, firstly, evaluating its performance on recently published marine datasets. Then, we integrate the different blocks of the system on ROS platform where we could test it in real-time on synchronized LiDAR and camera data collected in various marine conditions available in the MIT marine datasets. We present a thorough experimental analysis of the results obtained using two approaches; one that uses sensor fusion between the camera and LiDAR to detect and track the obstacles and the other uses only the LiDAR point cloud for the detection and tracking.

Model watermarking counters MEAs by embedding forensic markers for ownership verification. Current black-box watermarks prioritize MEA survival through representation entanglement, yet inadequately explore resilience against sequential MEAs and removal attacks. Our study reveals that this risk is underestimated because existing removal methods are weakened by entanglement. To address this gap, we propose Watermark Removal attacK (WRK), which circumvents entanglement constraints by exploiting decision boundaries shaped by prevailing sample-level watermark artifacts. WRK effectively reduces watermark success rates by at least 88.79% across existing watermarking benchmarks.\n  For robust protection, we propose Class-Feature Watermarks (CFW), which improve resilience by leveraging class-level artifacts. CFW constructs a synthetic class using out-of-domain samples, eliminating vulnerable decision boundaries between original domain samples and their artifact-modified counterparts (watermark samples). CFW concurrently optimizes both MEA transferability and post-MEA stability. Experiments across multiple domains show that CFW consistently outperforms prior methods in resilience, maintaining a watermark success rate of at least 70.15% in extracted models even under the combined MEA and WRK distortion, while preserving the utility of protected models."

We evaluate the effectiveness of this method across several forecasting models, including DLinear (MLP), TimesNet (CNN), and iTrainformer (Transformer), these models represent some of the most recent advances in time series forecasting. Our experiments, conducted on four datasets (ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2) and compared against eight other augmentation techniques, demonstrate that IBMA consistently enhances performance, achieving 22 improvements out of 24 instances, with 10 of those being the best performances, particularly with iTrainformer imputation."

This leads to a suboptimal trade-off between performance and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce DynaQuant, a novel framework for dynamic mixed-precision quantization that operates on two complementary levels. First, we propose content-aware quantization, where learnable scaling and offset parameters dynamically adapt to the statistical variations of latent features. This fine-grained adaptation is trained end-to-end using a novel Distance-aware Gradient Modulator (DGM), which provides a more informative learning signal than the standard Straight-Through Estimator. Second, we introduce a data-driven, dynamic bit-width selector that learns to assign an optimal bit precision to each layer, dynamically reconfiguring the network's precision profile based on the input data. Our fully dynamic approach offers substantial flexibility in balancing rate-distortion (R-D) performance and computational cost. Experiments demonstrate that DynaQuant achieves rd performance comparable to full-precision models while significantly reducing computational and storage requirements, thereby enabling the practical deployment of advanced LIC on diverse hardware platforms."

Because of their nonlinear, underactuated dynamics and the partial observability of wind fields, prior work has largely relied on model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods to design near-optimal control schemes for station-keeping. These methods often compare only against hand-crafted heuristics, dismissing model-based approaches as impractical given the system complexity and uncertain wind forecasts. We revisit this assumption about the efficacy of model-based control for station-keeping by developing First-Order Model Predictive Control (FOMPC). By implementing the wind and balloon dynamics as differentiable functions in JAX, we enable gradient-based trajectory optimization for online planning. FOMPC outperforms a state-of-the-art RL policy, achieving a 24% improvement in time-within-radius (TWR) without requiring offline training, though at the cost of greater online computation per control step. Through systematic ablations of modeling assumptions and control factors, we show that online planning is effective across many configurations, including under simplified wind and dynamics models."

Existing unsupervised RLVR methods, including pure entropy minimization, can overfit to incorrect labels and limit the crucial reward ranking signal for Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). To address these challenges and enhance noise tolerance, we propose a novel two-stage, token-level entropy optimization method for RLVR. This approach dynamically guides the model from exploration to exploitation during training. In the initial exploration phase, token-level entropy maximization promotes diverse and stochastic output generation, serving as a strong regularizer that prevents premature convergence to noisy labels and ensures sufficient intra-group variation, which enables more reliable reward gradient estimation in GRPO. As training progresses, the method transitions into the exploitation phase, where token-level entropy minimization encourages the model to produce confident and deterministic outputs, thereby consolidating acquired knowledge and refining prediction accuracy. Empirically, across three MLLM backbones - Qwen2-VL-2B, Qwen2-VL-7B, and Qwen2.5-VL-3B - spanning diverse noise settings and multiple tasks, our phased strategy consistently outperforms prior approaches by unifying and enhancing external, internal, and entropy-based methods, delivering robust and superior performance across the board."

We show how these approaches can be integrated into a practical GCRL method that fits a quasimetric distance using a multistep Monte-Carlo return. We show our method outperforms existing GCRL methods on long-horizon simulated tasks with up to 4000 steps, even with visual observations. We also demonstrate that our method can enable stitching in the real-world robotic manipulation domain (Bridge setup). Our approach is the first end-to-end GCRL method that enables multistep stitching in this real-world manipulation domain from an unlabeled offline dataset of visual observations."

Task and motion planning (TAMP) methods interleave the two processes of task planning and motion planning to ensure goal achievement and motion feasibility. Within the TAMP context, we are concerned with the mobile manipulation (MoMa) of multiple objects, where it is necessary to interleave actions for navigation and manipulation.\n  In particular, we aim to compute where and how each object should be placed given underspecified goals, such as ``set up dinner table with a fork, knife and plate.'' We leverage the rich common sense knowledge from large language models (LLMs), e.g., about how tableware is organized, to facilitate both task-level and motion-level planning. In addition, we use computer vision methods to learn a strategy for selecting base positions to facilitate MoMa behaviors, where the base position corresponds to the robot's ``footprint'' and orientation in its operating space. Altogether, this article provides a principled TAMP framework for MoMa tasks that accounts for common sense about object rearrangement and is adaptive to novel situations that include many objects that need to be moved. We performed quantitative experiments in both real-world settings and simulated environments. We evaluated the success rate and efficiency in completing long-horizon object rearrangement tasks. While the robot completed 84.4\\% real-world object rearrangement trials, subjective human evaluations indicated that the robot's performance is still lower than experienced human waiters."

To address these limitations, we propose a novel shadow generation framework based on a Keypoints Linear Model (KPLM) and a Shadow Triangle Algorithm (STA). KPLM models articulated human bodies using nine keypoints and one bounding block, enabling physically plausible shadow projection and dynamic shading across joints, thereby enhancing visual realism. STA further improves geometric accuracy by computing shadow angles, lengths, and spatial positions through explicit geometric formulations.

In this paper, we propose a network named Multi-Granularity Mutual Refinement Network (Mg-MRN), which refine discriminative and transferable visual features by learning decoupled multi-granularity features and cross-granularity feature interactions. Specifically, we design a multi-granularity feature extraction module to learn region-level discriminative features through decoupled region feature mining. Then, a cross-granularity feature fusion module strengthens the inherent interactions between region features of varying granularities. This module enhances the discriminability of representations at each granularity level by integrating region representations from adjacent hierarchies, further improving ZSL recognition performance.

However, current LULC models are typically developed for a specific modality and a fixed class taxonomy, limiting their generability and broader applicability. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) offer promising opportunities for building universal models. Yet, task-agnostic FMs often require fine-tuning for downstream applications, whereas task-specific FMs rely on massive amounts of labeled data for training, which is costly and impractical in the remote sensing (RS) domain. To address these challenges, we propose LandSegmenter, an LULC FM framework that resolves three-stage challenges at the input, model, and output levels. From the input side, to alleviate the heavy demand on labeled data for FM training, we introduce LAnd Segment (LAS), a large-scale, multi-modal, multi-source dataset built primarily with globally sampled weak labels from existing LULC products. LAS provides a scalable, cost-effective alternative to manual annotation, enabling large-scale FM training across diverse LULC domains. For model architecture, LandSegmenter integrates an RS-specific adapter for cross-modal feature extraction and a text encoder for semantic awareness enhancement. At the output stage, we introduce a class-wise confidence-guided fusion strategy to mitigate semantic omissions and further improve LandSegmenter's zero-shot performance. We evaluate LandSegmenter on six precisely annotated LULC datasets spanning diverse modalities and class taxonomies. Extensive transfer learning and zero-shot experiments demonstrate that LandSegmenter achieves competitive or superior performance, particularly in zero-shot settings when transferred to unseen datasets.

To balance the domain alignment of all modalities, we formulate the problem as a multi-objective task, aiming for a Pareto optimal solution. By exploiting the properties specific to our model, the problem can be simplified to a quadratic programming problem.

Existing approaches either collapse this variability into a consensus mask or rely on separate model branches for each annotator. We introduce ProSona, a two-stage framework that learns a continuous latent space of annotation styles, enabling controllable personalization via natural language prompts. A probabilistic U-Net backbone captures diverse expert hypotheses, while a prompt-guided projection mechanism navigates this latent space to generate personalized segmentations. A multi-level contrastive objective aligns textual and visual representations, promoting disentangled and interpretable expert styles. Across the LIDC-IDRI lung nodule and multi-institutional prostate MRI datasets, ProSona reduces the Generalized Energy Distance by 17% and improves mean Dice by more than one point compared with DPersona. These results demonstrate that natural-language prompts can provide flexible, accurate, and interpretable control over personalized medical image segmentation.

Existing methods typically assume fixed input/output densities or rely on image-based representations, making them less suitable for real-world scenarios with variable sparsity and limited supervision. In this paper, we introduce Density-agnostic and Class-aware Network (DANCE), a novel framework that completes only the missing regions while preserving the observed geometry. DANCE generates candidate points via ray-based sampling from multiple viewpoints. A transformer decoder then refines their positions and predicts opacity scores, which determine the validity of each point for inclusion in the final surface. To incorporate semantic guidance, a lightweight classification head is trained directly on geometric features, enabling category-consistent completion without external image supervision. Extensive experiments on the PCN and MVP benchmarks show that DANCE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and structural consistency, while remaining robust to varying input densities and noise levels."

To address this, we present NeuSpring, a neural spring field for the reconstruction and simulation of deformable objects from videos. Built upon spring-mass models for realistic physical simulation, our method consists of two major innovations: 1) a piecewise topology solution that efficiently models multi-region spring connection topologies using zero-order optimization, which considers the material heterogeneity of real-world objects. 2) a neural spring field that represents spring physical properties across different frames using a canonical coordinate-based neural network, which effectively leverages the spatial associativity of springs for physical learning.

Classifiers have been developed as an alternative in cases with certain points of interest, but the trade-off between speed and accuracy remains an issue. Thus, we propose a novel fast multi-organ segmentation framework with the usage of hierarchical sparse sampling and a Residual Transformer. Compared with whole-volume analysis, the hierarchical sparse sampling strategy could successfully reduce computation time while preserving a meaningful hierarchical context utilizing multiple resolution levels. The architecture of the Residual Transformer segmentation network could extract and combine information from different levels of information in the sparse descriptor while maintaining a low computational cost. In an internal data set containing 10,253 CT images and the public dataset TotalSegmentator, the proposed method successfully improved qualitative and quantitative segmentation performance compared to the current fast organ classifier, with fast speed at the level of ~2.24 seconds on CPU hardware. The potential of achieving real-time fine organ segmentation is suggested."

      "summary": "Modern oriented object detectors typically predict a set of bounding boxes and select the top-ranked ones based on estimated localization quality. Achieving high detection performance requires that the estimated quality closely aligns with the actual localization accuracy. To this end, existing approaches predict the Intersection over Union (IoU) between the predicted and ground-truth (GT) boxes as a proxy for localization quality. However, box-level IoU prediction suffers from a structural coupling issue: since the predicted box is derived from the detector's internal estimation of the GT box, the predicted IoU--based on their similarity--can be overestimated for poorly localized boxes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Pixel-level Quality Assessment (PQA) framework, which replaces box-level IoU prediction with the integration of pixel-level spatial consistency. PQA measures the alignment between each pixel's relative position to the predicted box and its corresponding position to the GT box. By operating at the pixel level, PQA avoids directly comparing the predicted box with the estimated GT box, thereby eliminating the inherent similarity bias in box-level IoU prediction. Furthermore, we introduce a new integration metric that aggregates pixel-level spatial consistency into a unified quality score, yielding a more accurate approximation of the actual localization quality. Extensive experiments on HRSC2016 and DOTA demonstrate that PQA can be seamlessly integrated into various oriented object detectors, consistently improving performance (e.g., +5.96% AP$_{50:95}$ on Rotated RetinaNet and +2.32% on STD)."

As a result, the generated occluded regions often exhibit poor quality due to the information loss caused by the low bit-rate latent code. To address this, we introduce the warping-and-inpainting strategy to incorporate image inpainting into 3D GAN inversion and propose a novel 3D GAN inversion method, WarpGAN. Specifically, we first employ a 3D GAN inversion encoder to project the single-view image into a latent code that serves as the input to 3D GAN. Then, we perform warping to a novel view using the depth map generated by 3D GAN. Finally, we develop a novel SVINet, which leverages the symmetry prior and multi-view image correspondence w.r.t. the same latent code to perform inpainting of occluded regions in the warped image. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art methods."

Remarkably, this adaptive mechanism occasionally achieves performance gains over dense models, offering a novel paradigm for adaptive pruning. During the KV cache pruning stage, based on observations of visual information degradation, SharpV prunes degraded visual features via a self-calibration manner, guided by similarity to original visual features. In this way, SharpV achieves hierarchical cache pruning from the perspective of information bottleneck, offering a new insight into VideoLLMs' information flow.

Inspired from this human-centric workflow, we introduce Anatomy-VLM, a fine-grained, vision-language model that incorporates multi-scale information. First, we design a model encoder to localize key anatomical features from entire medical images. Second, these regions are enriched with structured knowledge for contextually-aware interpretation. Finally, the model encoder aligns multi-scale medical information to generate clinically-interpretable disease prediction. Anatomy-VLM achieves outstanding performance on both in- and out-of-distribution datasets. We also validate the performance of Anatomy-VLM on downstream image segmentation tasks, suggesting that its fine-grained alignment captures anatomical and pathology-related knowledge.

Our framework, called Psychic, models these small indicative motions through a jump-drift-diffusion stochastic differential equation to cover discontinuous and continuous dynamics. Kramers-Moyal (KM) coefficients allow us to detect jumps with a trajectory which we pair with a statistical outlier detection algorithm to nominate goal transitions. Through identifying jumps, we can perform early detection of existing goals and discover undefined goals in unstructured scenarios. Our framework then applies a Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) model using KM coefficients with the goal transitions as a control input to infer an operator's motion behavior in unstructured scenarios. We demonstrate Psychic can produce probabilistic reachability sets and compare our strategy to a negative log-likelihood model fit. We perform a retrospective study on 600 operator trajectories in a hands-free teleoperation task to evaluate the efficacy of our opensource package, Psychic, in both offline and online learning."

By leveraging deep learning-based risk models, screening intervals can be personalized, especially for high-risk individuals. While recent methods increasingly incorporate longitudinal information from prior mammograms, accurate spatial alignment across time points remains a key challenge. Misalignment can obscure meaningful tissue changes and degrade model performance. In this study, we provide insights into various alignment strategies, image-based registration, feature-level (representation space) alignment with and without regularization, and implicit alignment methods, for their effectiveness in longitudinal deep learning-based risk modeling. Using two large-scale mammography datasets, we assess each method across key metrics, including predictive accuracy, precision, recall, and deformation field quality.\n  Our results show that image-based registration consistently outperforms the more recently favored feature-based and implicit approaches across all metrics, enabling more accurate, temporally consistent predictions and generating smooth, anatomically plausible deformation fields. Although regularizing the deformation field improves deformation quality, it reduces the risk prediction performance of feature-level alignment. Applying image-based deformation fields within the feature space yields the best risk prediction performance.\n  These findings underscore the importance of image-based deformation fields for spatial alignment in longitudinal risk modeling, offering improved prediction accuracy and robustness. This approach has strong potential to enhance personalized screening and enable earlier interventions for high-risk individuals.

      "summary": "Minimizing inconsistencies across successive versions of an AI system is as crucial as reducing the overall error. In image classification, such inconsistencies manifest as negative flips, where an updated model misclassifies test samples that were previously classified correctly. This issue becomes increasingly pronounced as the number of training classes grows over time, since adding new categories reduces the margin of each class and may introduce conflicting patterns that undermine their learning process, thereby degrading performance on the original subset. To mitigate negative flips, we propose a novel approach that preserves the margins of the original model while learning an improved one. Our method encourages a larger relative margin between the previously learned and newly introduced classes by introducing an explicit margin-calibration term on the logits. However, overly constraining the logit margin for the new classes can significantly degrade their accuracy compared to a new independently trained model. To address this, we integrate a double-source focal distillation loss with the previous model and a new independently trained model, learning an appropriate decision margin from both old and new data, even under a logit margin calibration. Extensive experiments on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces the negative flip rate with high overall accuracy."

However, ROS 2's publish/subscribe API leaves DAG precedence constraints unenforced: a callback may publish mid-execution, and multi-input callbacks let developers choose topic-matching policies. Thus preserving DAG semantics relies on conventions; once violated, the model collapses. We propose the Function-as-Subtask (FasS) API, which expresses each subtask as a function whose arguments/return values are the subtask's incoming/outgoing edges. By minimizing description freedom, DAG semantics is guaranteed at the API rather than by programmer discipline. We implement a DAG-native scheduler using FasS on a Rust-based experimental kernel and evaluate its semantic fidelity, and we outline design guidelines for applying FasS to Linux Linux sched_ext."

State-of-the-art multi-view methods learn to fuse predictions across views by training on large annotated datasets, leading to poor generalization when the test scenario differs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SkelSplat, a novel framework for multi-view 3D human pose estimation based on differentiable Gaussian rendering. Human pose is modeled as a skeleton of 3D Gaussians, one per joint, optimized via differentiable rendering to enable seamless fusion of arbitrary camera views without 3D ground-truth supervision. Since Gaussian Splatting was originally designed for dense scene reconstruction, we propose a novel one-hot encoding scheme that enables independent optimization of human joints. SkelSplat outperforms approaches that do not rely on 3D ground truth in Human3.6M and CMU, while reducing the cross-dataset error up to 47.8% compared to learning-based methods. Experiments on Human3.6M-Occ and Occlusion-Person demonstrate robustness to occlusions, without scenario-specific fine-tuning. Our project page is available here: https://skelsplat.github.io."

However, extending these methods to quadruped robots remains challenging due to their distinct and highly dynamic motion patterns. Models that perform well on pedestrian data often experience severe degradation when deployed on legged platforms. To tackle this challenge, we introduce X-IONet, a cross-platform inertial odometry framework that operates solely using a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). X-IONet incorporates a rule-based expert selection module to classify motion platforms and route IMU sequences to platform-specific expert networks. The displacement prediction network features a dual-stage attention architecture that jointly models long-range temporal dependencies and inter-axis correlations, enabling accurate motion representation. It outputs both displacement and associated uncertainty, which are further fused through an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for robust state estimation. Extensive experiments on public pedestrian datasets and a self-collected quadruped robot dataset demonstrate that X-IONet achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 14.3% and Relative Trajectory Error (RTE) by 11.4% on pedestrian data, and by 52.8% and 41.3% on quadruped robot data. These results highlight the effectiveness of X-IONet in advancing accurate and robust inertial navigation across both human and legged robot platforms."

Despite their success in open-loop evaluations, these systems often exhibit significant performance degradation in closed-loop scenarios due to causal confusion. This confusion is fundamentally exacerbated by the overreliance of the imitation learning paradigm on expert trajectories, which often contain unattributable noise and interfere with the modeling of causal relationships between environmental contexts and appropriate driving actions.\n  To address this fundamental limitation, we propose Perception-Guided Self-Supervision (PGS) - a simple yet effective training paradigm that leverages perception outputs as the primary supervisory signals, explicitly modeling causal relationships in decision-making. The proposed framework aligns both the inputs and outputs of the decision-making module with perception results, such as lane centerlines and the predicted motions of surrounding agents, by introducing positive and negative self-supervision for the ego trajectory. This alignment is specifically designed to mitigate causal confusion arising from the inherent noise in expert trajectories.\n  Equipped with perception-driven supervision, our method, built on a standard end-to-end architecture, achieves a Driving Score of 78.08 and a mean success rate of 48.64% on the challenging closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods, including those employing more complex network architectures and inference pipelines. These results underscore the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed PGS framework and point to a promising direction for addressing causal confusion and enhancing real-world generalization in autonomous driving."

However, the redundancy in burst images leads to the increased storage and transmission demands, as well as reduced efficiency of downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a new task of Burst Image Quality Assessment (BuIQA), to evaluate the task-driven quality of each frame within a burst sequence, providing reasonable cues for burst image selection. Specifically, we establish the first benchmark dataset for BuIQA, consisting of $7,346$ burst sequences with $45,827$ images and $191,572$ annotated quality scores for multiple downstream scenarios. Inspired by the data analysis, a unified BuIQA framework is proposed to achieve an efficient adaption for BuIQA under diverse downstream scenarios. Specifically, a task-driven prompt generation network is developed with heterogeneous knowledge distillation, to learn the priors of the downstream task. Then, the task-aware quality assessment network is introduced to assess the burst image quality based on the task prompt. Extensive experiments across 10 downstream scenarios demonstrate the impressive BuIQA performance of the proposed approach, outperforming the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, it can achieve $0.33$ dB PSNR improvement in the downstream tasks of denoising and super-resolution, by applying our approach to select the high-quality burst frames."

As a representative task for addressing this challenge, layout-to-image generation aims to generate images that are spatially consistent with the given layout condition. Existing layout-to-image methods typically introduce the layout condition by integrating adapter modules into the base generative model. However, the generated images often exhibit low visual quality and stylistic inconsistency with the base model, indicating a loss of pretrained knowledge. To alleviate this issue, we construct the Layout Synthesis (LaySyn) dataset, which leverages images synthesized by the base model itself to mitigate the distribution shift from the pretraining data. Moreover, we propose the Layout Control (Laytrol) Network, in which parameters are inherited from MM-DiT to preserve the pretrained knowledge of the base model. To effectively activate the copied parameters and avoid disturbance from unstable control conditions, we adopt a dedicated initialization scheme for Laytrol. In this scheme, the layout encoder is initialized as a pure text encoder to ensure that its output tokens remain within the data domain of MM-DiT. Meanwhile, the outputs of the layout control network are initialized to zero. In addition, we apply Object-level Rotary Position Embedding to the layout tokens to provide coarse positional information. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."

Compact models are essential for analyzing the circuit and system-level performance of experimental RRAM devices. However, most existing RRAM compact models rely on multiple fitting parameters to reproduce the device I-V characteristics, and in most cases, as the parameters are not directly related to measurable quantities, their extraction requires extensive manual tuning, making the process time-consuming and limiting adaptability across different devices. This work presents an automated framework for extracting the fitting parameters of the widely used Stanford RRAM model directly from the device I-V characteristics. The framework employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a synthetic dataset to generate initial parameter estimates, which are then refined through three heuristic optimization blocks that minimize errors via adaptive binary search in the parameter space. We evaluated the framework using four key NVM metrics: set voltage, reset voltage, hysteresis loop area, and low resistance state (LRS) slope. Benchmarking against RRAM device characteristics derived from previously reported Stanford model fits, other analytical models, and experimental data shows that the framework achieves low error across diverse device characteristics, offering a fast, reliable, and robust solution for RRAM modeling."

However, these models are often restricted by a ``single-task-single-model'' paradigm, severely limiting their generalizability and scalability in multi-task scenarios. Motivated by the cross-domain generalization ability of large language models, we propose a universal visual perception framework based on flow matching that can generate diverse visual representations across multiple tasks. Our approach formulates the process as a universal flow-matching problem from image patch tokens to task-specific representations rather than an independent generation or regression problem. By leveraging a strong self-supervised foundation model as the anchor and introducing a multi-scale, circular task embedding mechanism, our method learns a universal velocity field to bridge the gap between heterogeneous tasks, supporting efficient and flexible representation transfer. Extensive experiments on classification, detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and image-text retrieval demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, outperforming prior generalist and several specialist models. Ablation studies further validate the robustness, scalability, and generalization of our framework. Our work marks a significant step towards general-purpose visual perception, providing a solid foundation for future research in universal vision modeling."

These constraints cause a lack of geometric cues and reduced accuracy in occluded or truncated scenes. While recent approaches incorporate additional depth information to address geometric ambiguity, they overlook the visual cues crucial for robust recognition. We propose MonoCLUE, which enhances monocular 3D detection by leveraging both local clustering and generalized scene memory of visual features. First, we perform K-means clustering on visual features to capture distinct object-level appearance parts (e.g., bonnet, car roof), improving detection of partially visible objects. The clustered features are propagated across regions to capture objects with similar appearances. Second, we construct a generalized scene memory by aggregating clustered features across images, providing consistent representations that generalize across scenes. This improves object-level feature consistency, enabling stable detection across varying environments. Lastly, we integrate both local cluster features and generalized scene memory into object queries, guiding attention toward informative regions. Exploiting a unified local clustering and generalized scene memory strategy, MonoCLUE enables robust monocular 3D detection under occlusion and limited visibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark."

Ventriculomegaly is a prenatal condition characterized by dilated cerebral ventricles of the fetal brain and is important to diagnose early, as it can be associated with an increased risk for fetal aneuploidies and/or underlying genetic syndromes. An Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), recently developed by our group, was fine-tuned for a binary classification task to distinguish fetal brain ultrasound images as either normal or showing ventriculomegaly. The USF-MAE incorporates a Vision Transformer encoder pretrained on more than 370,000 ultrasound images from the OpenUS-46 corpus. For this study, the pretrained encoder was adapted and fine-tuned on a curated dataset of fetal brain ultrasound images to optimize its performance for ventriculomegaly detection. Model evaluation was conducted using 5-fold cross-validation and an independent test cohort, and performance was quantified using accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The proposed USF-MAE model reached an F1-score of 91.76% on the 5-fold cross-validation and 91.78% on the independent test set, with much higher scores than those obtained by the baseline models by 19.37% and 16.15% compared to VGG-19, 2.31% and 2.56% compared to ResNet-50, and 5.03% and 11.93% compared to ViT-B/16, respectively. The model also showed a high mean test precision of 94.47% and an accuracy of 97.24%. The Eigen-CAM (Eigen Class Activation Map) heatmaps showed that the model was focusing on the ventricle area for the diagnosis of ventriculomegaly, which has explainability and clinical plausibility."

To address extreme class imbalance and asymmetric error costs, we optimize with Asymmetric Loss, employ mixed-precision (AMP), cosine learning-rate decay with warm-up, gradient clipping, and an exponential moving average (EMA) of weights. We propose a lightweight Label-Graph Refinement module placed after the classifier: given per-label probabilities, it learns a sparse, trainable inter-label coupling matrix that refines logits via a single message-passing step while adding only an L1-regularized parameter head. At inference, we apply horizontal flip test-time augmentation (TTA) and average predictions across MIS folds (a compact deep ensemble). Evaluation uses macro AUC averaging classwise ROC-AUC and skipping single-class labels in a fold to reflect balanced performance across conditions. On our dataset, a strong SE-ResNeXt101 baseline attains competitive macro AUC (e.g., 92.64% in our runs). Adding the Label-Graph Refinement consistently improves validation macro AUC across folds with negligible compute. The resulting method is reproducible, hardware-friendly, and requires no extra annotations, offering a practical route to stronger multilabel CXR classifiers."

We propose that polyurethane rubber, used for high-load applications like shoe soles, rubber wheels, and industrial gaskets, may provide improved physical gel resilience, potentially at the cost of sensitivity. To compare the resilience and sensitivity of silicone and polyurethane VBTS gels, we propose a series of standard evaluation benchmarking protocols. Our resilience tests assess sensor durability across normal loading, shear loading, and abrasion. For sensitivity, we introduce model-free assessments of force and spatial sensitivity to directly measure the physical capabilities of each gel without effects introduced from data and model quality. Finally, we include a bottle cap loosening and tightening demonstration as an example where polyurethane gels provide an advantage over their silicone counterparts."

Recent approaches demonstrate that VLMs can be adapted into competitive embedding models via large-scale contrastive learning, enabling the simultaneous optimization of two complementary objectives. We argue that the two aforementioned objectives can be decoupled: a comprehensive understanding of the input facilitates the embedding model in achieving superior performance in downstream tasks via contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose CoMa, a compressed pre-training phase, which serves as a warm-up stage for contrastive learning. Experiments demonstrate that with only a small amount of pre-training data, we can transform a VLM into a competitive embedding model. CoMa achieves new state-of-the-art results among VLMs of comparable size on the MMEB, realizing optimization in both efficiency and effectiveness."

To mitigate this issue, prior works introduced per-sample normalizer estimators, which are updated at each epoch in a blockwise coordinate manner to keep track of updated encoders. However, this scheme incurs optimization error that scales with the ratio of dataset size to batch size, limiting effectiveness for large datasets or small batches. To overcome this limitation, we propose NeuCLIP, a novel and elegant optimization framework based on two key ideas: (i) $\\textbf{reformulating}$ the contrastive loss for each sample $\\textbf{via convex analysis}$ into a minimization problem with an auxiliary variable representing its log-normalizer; and (ii) $\\textbf{transforming}$ the resulting minimization over $n$ auxiliary variables (where $n$ is the dataset size) via $\\textbf{variational analysis}$ into the minimization over a compact neural network that predicts the log-normalizers. We design an alternating optimization algorithm that jointly trains the CLIP model and the auxiliary network.

Although both are effective individually, they are typically studied in isolation due to their compounded negative impact on model accuracy when combined. In this work, we introduce SLOPE Structured Sparsity at Low Precision), a unified framework, to effectively combine structured sparsity and low-bit quantization in a principled way. We show that naively combining sparsity and quantization severely harms performance due to the compounded impact of both techniques. To address this, we propose a training-time regularization strategy that minimizes the discrepancy between full-precision weights and their sparse, quantized counterparts by promoting angular alignment rather than direct matching.

Metrics include pod deployment and deletion times, CPU and memory usage, and inter-pod data rates. The observed results indicate that CODECO offers reduced CPU consumption and more stable communication patterns, at the cost of modest memory overhead (10-15%) and slightly increased pod lifecycle latency due to secure overlay initialization."

In this paper, we propose a learning framework that enables the robot to acquire a diverse repertoire of omnidirectional gaits without reference motions. Each body part is controlled by a phase variable capable of forward and backward evolution, with a phase coverage reward to promote the exploration of the leg phase space. Additionally, morphological symmetry of the robot is incorporated via data augmentation, improving sample efficiency and enforcing both motion-level and task-level symmetry in learned behaviors. Extensive experiments show that the robot successfully acquires 22 omnidirectional gaits exhibiting both dynamic and symmetric movements, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework."

To address this issue, we propose a mechanism-aware unsupervised general image fusion (MAUGIF) method based on dual cross-image autoencoders. Initially, we introduce a classification of additive and multiplicative fusion according to the inherent mechanisms of different fusion tasks. Then, dual encoders map source images into a shared latent space, capturing common content while isolating modality-specific details. During the decoding phase, dual decoders act as feature injectors, selectively reintegrating the unique characteristics of each modality into the shared content for reconstruction. The modality-specific features are injected into the source image in the fusion process, generating the fused image that integrates information from both modalities. The architecture of decoders varies according to their fusion mechanisms, enhancing both performance and interpretability. Extensive experiments are conducted on diverse fusion tasks to validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MAUGIF."

SWAN supports both desktop and mobile platforms, offers real-time metadata capture, and allows flexible mapping of swipe gestures to class labels. In a pilot study with four pathologists annotating 600 mitotic figure image patches, we compared SWAN against a traditional folder-sorting workflow. SWAN enabled rapid annotations with pairwise percent agreement ranging from 86.52% to 93.68% (Cohen's Kappa = 0.61-0.80), while for the folder-based method, the pairwise percent agreement ranged from 86.98% to 91.32% (Cohen's Kappa = 0.63-0.75) for the task of classifying atypical versus normal mitotic figures, demonstrating high consistency between annotators and comparable performance. Participants rated the tool as highly usable and appreciated the ability to annotate on mobile devices.

To address this, we introduce ImageBindDC, a novel data condensation framework operating within the unified feature space of ImageBind. Our approach moves beyond conventional distribution-matching by employing a powerful Characteristic Function (CF) loss, which operates in the Fourier domain to facilitate a more precise statistical alignment via exact infinite moment matching. We design our objective to enforce three critical levels of distributional consistency: (i) uni-modal alignment, which matches the statistical properties of synthetic and real data within each modality; (ii) cross-modal alignment, which preserves pairwise semantics by matching the distributions of hybrid real-synthetic data pairs; and (iii) joint-modal alignment, which captures the complete multivariate data structure by aligning the joint distribution of real data pairs with their synthetic counterparts. Extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of ImageBindDC: on the NYU-v2 dataset, a model trained on just 5 condensed datapoints per class achieves lossless performance comparable to one trained on the full dataset, achieving a new state-of-the-art with an 8.2\\% absolute improvement over the previous best method and more than 4$\\times$ less condensation time."

Existing works primarily follow the localize-editing paradigm, focusing on independent object localization and editing while neglecting critical inter-object interactions. However, this work points out that the neglected attention entanglements in inter-object conflict regions, inherently hinder disentangled multi-object editing, leading to either inter-object editing leakage or intra-object editing constraints. We thereby propose a novel multi-layer disentangled editing framework LayerEdit, a training-free method which, for the first time, through precise object-layered decomposition and coherent fusion, enables conflict-free object-layered editing. Specifically, LayerEdit introduces a novel \"decompose-editingfusion\" framework, consisting of: (1) Conflict-aware Layer Decomposition module, which utilizes an attention-aware IoU scheme and time-dependent region removing, to enhance conflict awareness and suppression for layer decomposition. (2) Object-layered Editing module, to establish coordinated intra-layer text guidance and cross-layer geometric mapping, achieving disentangled semantic and structural modifications. (3) Transparency-guided Layer Fusion module, to facilitate structure-coherent inter-object layer fusion through precise transparency guidance learning. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of LayerEdit over existing methods, showing unprecedented intra-object controllability and inter-object coherence in complex multi-object scenarios.

We propose a strong baseline for training-free OVSS termed as NERVE (Neighbourhood \\& Entropy-guided Random-walk for open-Vocabulary sEgmentation), which uniquely integrates global and fine-grained local information, exploiting the neighbourhood structure from the self-attention layer of a stable diffusion model. We also introduce a stochastic random walk for refining the affinity rather than relying on fixed-size Gaussian kernels for local context. This spatial diffusion process encourages propagation across connected and semantically related areas, enabling it to effectively delineate objects with arbitrary shapes. Whereas most existing approaches treat self-attention maps from different transformer heads or layers equally, our method uses entropy-based uncertainty to select the most relevant maps. Notably, our method does not require any conventional post-processing techniques like Conditional Random Fields (CRF) or Pixel-Adaptive Mask Refinement (PAMR). Experiments are performed on 7 popular semantic segmentation benchmarks, yielding an overall state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation performance, providing an effective approach to open-vocabulary semantic segmentation."

In this context, open-set recognition plays a vital role by identifying whether a sample belongs to one of the known classes seen during training or should be rejected as an unknown. Recent studies have shown that features learned in the later stages of deep neural networks are observed to cluster around their class means, which themselves are arranged as individual vertices of a regular simplex [32]. The proposed method introduces a loss function designed to reject samples of unknown classes effectively by penalizing open space regions using auxiliary datasets. This approach achieves significant performance gain across four MedMNIST datasets-BloodMNIST, OCTMNIST, DermaMNIST, TissueMNIST and a publicly available skin dataset [29] outperforming state-of-the-art techniques."

Considering the data heterogeneity issues across distributed nodes, we introduce two key components to ensure the effective learning of DistZSL: a cross-node attribute regularizer and a global attribute-to-visual consensus. Our proposed cross-node attribute regularizer enforces the distances between attribute features to be similar across different nodes. In this manner, the overall attribute feature space would be stable during learning, and thus facilitate the establishment of visual-to-attribute(V2A) relationships. Then, we introduce the global attribute-tovisual consensus to mitigate biased V2A mappings learned from individual nodes. Specifically, we enforce the bilateral mapping between the attribute and visual feature distributions to be consistent across different nodes. Thus, the learned consistent V2A mapping can significantly enhance zero-shot learning across different nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DistZSL achieves superior performance to the state-of-the-art in learning from distributed data."

The ability to automatically examine changes in real-time with respect to the percentage of foam can be of great benefit to the plant. However, large amounts of labeled data are required to train standard Machine Learning (ML) models. The development of these systems is slow due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of labeled data. Additionally, the development is often hindered by the fact that different WTPs do not share their data due to privacy concerns. This paper proposes a new framework to address these challenges by combining Federated Learning (FL) with the state-of-the-art base model for image segmentation, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). The FL paradigm enables collaborative model training across multiple WTPs without centralizing sensitive operational data, thereby ensuring privacy. The framework accelerates training convergence and improves segmentation performance even with limited local datasets by leveraging SAM2's strong pre-trained weights for initialization. The methodology involves fine-tuning SAM2 on distributed clients (edge nodes) using the Flower framework, where a central Fog server orchestrates the process by aggregating model weights without accessing private data. The model was trained and validated using various data collections, including real-world images captured at a WTPs in Granada, Spain, a synthetically generated foam dataset, and images from publicly available datasets to improve generalization. This research offers a practical, scalable, and privacy-aware solution for automatic foam tracking in WTPs. The findings highlight the significant potential of integrating large-scale foundational models into FL systems to solve real-world industrial challenges characterized by distributed and sensitive data."

To do so, we perform probing on Stable Diffusion with simple regression layers that predict semantic attributes for objects and evaluate these predictions against human annotations. Surprisingly, we find that this success can actually be attributed to the text encoding occurring in CLIP rather than the reverse diffusion process. We demonstrate that groups of specific semantic attributes have markedly different decoding accuracy than the average, and are thus represented to different degrees. Finally, we show that attributes become more difficult to disambiguate from one another during the inverse diffusion process, further demonstrating the strongest semantic representation of object attributes in CLIP. We conclude that the separately trained CLIP vision-language model is what determines the human-like semantic representation, and that the diffusion process instead takes the role of a visual decoder."

Probabilistic inference-based MPC approaches, such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control, have gained significant attention by reinterpreting optimal control as a problem of probabilistic inference. Rather than relying on gradient-based numerical optimization, these methods estimate optimal control distributions through sampling-based techniques, accommodating arbitrary cost functions and dynamics. We first derive the optimal control distribution from the standard optimal control problem, elucidating its probabilistic interpretation and key characteristics. The widely used MPPI algorithm is then derived as a practical example, followed by discussions on prior and variational distribution design, tuning principles, and theoretical aspects.

Recent work has identified game theory, particularly the concept of Nash Equilibrium (NE), as a key enabler for behavior-aware decision-making. Yet, existing work falls short of fully unleashing the power of game-theoretic reasoning. Specifically, popular optimization-based methods require simplified robot dynamics and tend to get trapped in local minima due to convexification. Other works that rely on payoff matrices suffer from poor scalability due to the explicit enumeration of all possible trajectories. To bridge this gap, we introduce Game-Theoretic Nested Search (GTNS), a novel, scalable, and provably correct approach for computing NEs in general dynamical systems. GTNS efficiently searches the action space of all agents involved, while discarding trajectories that violate the NE constraint (no unilateral deviation) through an inner search over a lower-dimensional space. Our algorithm enables explicit selection among equilibria by utilizing a user-specified global objective, thereby capturing a rich set of realistic interactions. We demonstrate the approach on a variety of autonomous driving and racing scenarios where we achieve solutions in mere seconds on commodity hardware."

However, data heterogeneity and resource costs hinder the deployment of FL models, especially when using vision language models (VLM). To address these challenges, we propose a novel contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) based FL approach for medical image classification (FedMedCLIP). Specifically, we introduce a masked feature adaptation module (FAM) as a communication module to reduce the communication load while freezing the CLIP encoders to reduce the computational overhead. Furthermore, we propose a masked multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as a private local classifier to adapt to the client tasks. Moreover, we design an adaptive Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based distillation regularization method to enable mutual learning between FAM and MLP. Finally, we incorporate model compression to transmit the FAM parameters while using ensemble predictions for classification. Extensive experiments on four publicly available medical datasets demonstrate that our model provides feasible performance (e.g., 8\\% higher compared to second best baseline on ISIC2019) with reasonable resource cost (e.g., 120$\\times$ faster than FedAVG)."

In the assumed scenario, a UGV has a prior knowledge of its initial and target points within the dynamic environment. A global path has already been computed, and the robot is provided with waypoints along this path. As the UGV travels between these waypoints, the algorithm aims to avoid collisions with dynamic obstacles. These obstacles follow polynomial trajectories, with their initial positions randomized in the local map and velocities randomized between O and the allowable physical velocity limit of the robot, along with some random accelerations. The developed algorithm is tested in several scenarios where many dynamic obstacles move randomly in the environment. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed local path planning strategy by gradually generating a collision free path which allows the robot to navigate safely between initial and the target locations."

      "summary": "Generating sketches with specific patterns as expected, i.e., manipulating sketches in a controllable way, is a popular task. Recent studies control sketch features at stroke-level by editing values of stroke embeddings as conditions. However, in order to provide generator a global view about what a sketch is going to be drawn, all these edited conditions should be collected and fed into generator simultaneously before generation starts, i.e., no further manipulation is allowed during sketch generating process. In order to realize sketch drawing manipulation more flexibly, we propose a hierarchical auto-regressive sketch generating process. Instead of generating an entire sketch at once, each stroke in a sketch is generated in a three-staged hierarchy: 1) predicting a stroke embedding to represent which stroke is going to be drawn, and 2) anchoring the predicted stroke on the canvas, and 3) translating the embedding to a sequence of drawing actions to form the full sketch. Moreover, the stroke prediction, anchoring and translation are proceeded auto-regressively, i.e., both the recently generated strokes and their positions are considered to predict the current one, guiding model to produce an appropriate stroke at a suitable position to benefit the full sketch generation. It is flexible to manipulate stroke-level sketch drawing at any time during generation by adjusting the exposed editable stroke embeddings."

      "summary": "Cross-modal hashing (CMH) facilitates efficient retrieval across different modalities (e.g., image and text) by encoding data into compact binary representations. While recent methods have achieved remarkable performance, they often rely heavily on fully annotated datasets, which are costly and labor-intensive to obtain. In real-world scenarios, particularly in multi-label datasets, label noise is prevalent and severely degrades retrieval performance. Moreover, existing CMH approaches typically overlook the partial semantic overlaps inherent in multi-label data, limiting their robustness and generalization. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Semantic-Consistent Bidirectional Contrastive Hashing (SCBCH). The framework comprises two complementary modules: (1) Cross-modal Semantic-Consistent Classification (CSCC), which leverages cross-modal semantic consistency to estimate sample reliability and reduce the impact of noisy labels; (2) Bidirectional Soft Contrastive Hashing (BSCH), which dynamically generates soft contrastive sample pairs based on multi-label semantic overlap, enabling adaptive contrastive learning between semantically similar and dissimilar samples across modalities. Extensive experiments on four widely-used cross-modal retrieval benchmarks validate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches under noisy multi-label conditions."

      "summary": "Class incremental medical image segmentation (CIMIS) aims to preserve knowledge of previously learned classes while learning new ones without relying on old-class labels. However, existing methods 1) either adopt one-size-fits-all strategies that treat all spatial regions and feature channels equally, which may hinder the preservation of accurate old knowledge, 2) or focus solely on aligning local prototypes with global ones for old classes while overlooking their local representations in new data, leading to knowledge degradation. To mitigate the above issues, we propose Prototype-Guided Calibration Distillation (PGCD) and Dual-Aligned Prototype Distillation (DAPD) for CIMIS in this paper. Specifically, PGCD exploits prototype-to-feature similarity to calibrate class-specific distillation intensity in different spatial regions, effectively reinforcing reliable old knowledge and suppressing misleading information from old classes. Complementarily, DAPD aligns the local prototypes of old classes extracted from the current model with both global prototypes and local prototypes, further enhancing segmentation performance on old categories. Comprehensive evaluations on two widely used multi-organ segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its robustness and generalization capabilities."
