      "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous\nagents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video\nstreams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos\nwith full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance\non long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as\nthey either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant\nrecomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for\nreal-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a\nunified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During\ninference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,\na short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text\ntokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,\nwhich effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training\non prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a\nnew benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,\nper-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM\nachieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time\nperformance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy\nalso enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,\nimproving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by\n+5.96.

      "summary": "Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic\nmanipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained\nvision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these\npretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,\ntraining them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet\neffective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution\ncapability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our\narchitecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token\nand a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action\nknowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform\nlightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the\nsmall action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder\nand avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the\nlanguage model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to\nintegrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the\naction token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future\nactions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics\nnot captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains\nover training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous\nstate-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on\nLIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In\nreal-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently\noutperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),\nwhich demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate\nprecise actions while substantially reducing training costs."

      "summary": "With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have\nmade significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle\nwith diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper\naims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by\ntackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and\nlabor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of\neffective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to\nindividual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that\nintegrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware\nmodeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden\nthe all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using\na task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video\nscenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising\napproximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While\nspecialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for\nevaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by\nmanually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive\ntraining with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the\npotential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a\nspatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses\nscale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,\nextensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,\ndemonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across\nall scales and scenarios.

      "summary": "Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between\nlocally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that\nare rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing\nmodels typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time\nsteps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,\nand limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a\nlightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization\nthat adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into\ncompact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points\nacross multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence\ncriterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or\ngenerative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence\ncompression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a\nmodel-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised\ntime series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+\ndatasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30\narchives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity,\ndemonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\\% of the full-model performance while\noffering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves\nrobustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming\nuniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position\nSTaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware\ntime series modeling."

The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a\nsharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes\nclassic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)\nsteady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating\naround controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video\nactivity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a\ngrowing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,\nparameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight\nvision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building\nencoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;\ncontrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and\ndistillation.

Built upon a class-agnostic DETR\nbackbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images\nand learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight\ntransformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an\nalignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve\ndiscriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.\nUnlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables\ninference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background\nrejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a\nnew ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish\nstandardized evaluation protocols.

However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding\ncontrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such\nas web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human\ncognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' -\nthe capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order\nto enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive\nenvironments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that\nexplicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their\nreasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which\ntrains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search\ntrees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions.\nReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips\nit with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2,\nwe propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further\nstrengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both\noutcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts.\nExperiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one\nrealistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively\ninfuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome\nand interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon,\nplanning-intensive tasks.

We\nintroduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that\nenables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights\ndirectly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters\non-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each\ndiffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables\nthe model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying\nconditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through\nexperiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,\nparametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to\nspatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods.

While modern Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in\nembodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent\nof their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge\nthis gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating\nthe comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a\nVisual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.\nIt assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool\nRecognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool\nUnderstanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a\ntool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new\ntool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our\ncomprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,\nspecialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in\ntool understanding.

We propose FIPER, a general\nframework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that\ndoes not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending\nfailure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network\ndistillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in\ngenerated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score.

A failure alarm is triggered when both indicators,\naggregated over short time windows, exceed their thresholds. We evaluate FIPER\nacross five simulation and real-world environments involving diverse failure\nmodes.

In\nthis work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP\ntask. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.\nNext, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt\nFine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a\nteacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the\n\"overthinking\" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively\ninjects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its\nreasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed\nstrategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed approaches.

Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on\ntackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making\nit difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement\nmethods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited\neffectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of\nthis, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt\nFusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt\npairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we\nfuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing\nadaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific\ndegradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective\nProgressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the\nmodel's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not\nonly allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,\nbut also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we\nintroduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a\nwide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach\nnot only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also\nsignificantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a\nnotable 8.76\\% improvement.

With\na granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key\ninsights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely\ndistributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency\nfor visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit\nsignificant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these\nobservations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a\nnovel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to\nrefine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual\nmechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual\ndependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal\ntokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,\nVPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,\nwith its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.\nOur findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for\nanalyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization\nstrategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of\nLVLMs."

In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate\ndiagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for\nlow-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research\nintroduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for\ndiagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application\nof Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of\nshoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework\n(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and\ndisease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition\nto traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called\nUsability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action\nrecognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the\neffectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire\nmedical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in\nmedical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,\nthe accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by\n79.6\\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical\ncontribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video\nunderstanding in the medical field."

While existing long-video\nmethods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting\n(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to\nsingle-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive\nmotions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error\naccumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing\nclean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on\nself-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI\nincorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that\nrecycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into\nsupervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct\nits own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors\nthrough closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected\nfeedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to\nintervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow\nmatching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional\nintegration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors\ninto replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new\ninput. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no\nadditional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions\n(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams).

To boost the\n3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic\nTime-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture.

Building on TRT, we\ndevelop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for\nNLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments\nsignificantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data\ncaptured by different imaging systems.

The initialization network is trained\nin a self-supervised manner, taking advantage of the differentiability of the\nSF solver. We advance the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we\nshow that we can generate trajectories of tens of robots in cluttered\nenvironments in a few tens of milliseconds.

Moreover, our approach also\ngenerates smoother trajectories orders of magnitude faster than competing\nbaselines based on diffusion models.

Successful\nhuman-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations\nof the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge\nin deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of\ninterpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,\ni.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD\nsystems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable\nDriving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric\nvideo dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as\ncausal reasoning for the driver's decisions.

Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning\nthem more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in\nsafety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown\nAnimal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe\nlane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To\nbridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only\nidentifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent\ncategories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with\na sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling\ncomponent that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that\nlearns hierarchical relationships.

However, we\nfind that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.\nWe therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches\nthat enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on\nconfidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art\nperformance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and\n52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall\nArithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby\ndemonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks.

Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key\nfactor that contributes to object hallucination.

Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for\nidentifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these\nuncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers\nof the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating\nhallucinations.

To investigate this gap, we\nintroduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.\nEvaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and\ninference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the\nfast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is\ntreated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual\nprocess.

Combined with\nreinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception\naccuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,\nand generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks.

To address this, we propose a progressive evidence uncertainty\nguided attention (PEUA) mechanism to guide the model to focus on the feature\nrepresentation learning of hard regions. Unlike conventional approaches, PEUA\nprogressively refines attention using uncertainty maps while employing low-rank\nlearning to denoise attention weights, enhancing feature learning for\nchallenging regions.

      "summary": "Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model\nintellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a\nteacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have\nsuccessfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these\nmethods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration\nis a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on\nspatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,\nas students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose\nAdaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for\nimage restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher\nusing singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values\nto inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment\nneeded for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the\nteacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:\nsuper-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and\nderaining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by\n60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior\nmethods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach\nprovides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from\nunauthorized knowledge distillation."

      "summary": "Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples\nin white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor\ntransferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers\nhave explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods\nfor segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these\nmodels and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models\nresult in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we\npropose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input\nsample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to\ngenerate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original\nones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of\nadversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing\nmethods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original\ninput, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.\nExtensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,\nfour different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that\nSegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without\nintroducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current\nstate-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in\ntransfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than\n100%."

      "summary": "Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal\nrepresentation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic\ndescriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two\ndistinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family\n(e.g., dog $\\preceq$ mammal $\\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across\ndifferent concept families (e.g., \"a dog in a car\" $\\preceq$ dog, car). Recent\nworks have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which\nefficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing\ncompositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,\nwhich employs an $\\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic\nfactors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual\nhyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the\n$\\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on\nzero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and\ncompositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing\nsingle-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the\nembedding space."

      "summary": "Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides\nboth breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,\nand make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,\nrequiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep\nlearning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of\nhard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for\nfine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop\ngrowth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised\napproach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task\n(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the\ntime-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal\ntracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be\nused to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of\ncranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry\nfruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing\nseason (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide\napplication, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to\nother crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.\ncom/ronan-39/tlt/)."

      "summary": "In-Hand Manipulation, as many other dexterous tasks, remains a difficult\nchallenge in robotics by combining complex dynamic systems with the capability\nto control and manoeuvre various objects using its actuators. This work\npresents the application of a previously developed hybrid Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) Framework to In-Hand Manipulation task, verifying that it is\ncapable of improving the performance of the task. The model combines concepts\nof both Model-Free and Model-Based Reinforcement Learning, by guiding a trained\npolicy with the help of a dynamic model and value-function through trajectory\nevaluation, as done in Model Predictive Control. This work evaluates the\nperformance of the model by comparing it with the policy that will be guided.\nTo fully explore this, various tests are performed using both fully-actuated\nand under-actuated simulated robotic hands to manipulate different objects for\na given task. The performance of the model will also be tested for\ngeneralization tests, by changing the properties of the objects in which both\nthe policy and dynamic model were trained, such as density and size, and\nadditionally by guiding a trained policy in a certain object to perform the\nsame task in a different one. The results of this work show that, given a\npolicy with high average reward and an accurate dynamic model, the hybrid\nframework improves the performance of in-hand manipulation tasks for most test\ncases, even when the object properties are changed. However, this improvement\ncomes at the expense of increasing the computational cost, due to the\ncomplexity of trajectory evaluation."

Existing GNSS-aided approaches often rely on\npositioning results or raw measurements without ambiguity resolution, and their\nobservability properties remain underexplored. This paper proposes a tightly\ncoupled online calibration method that fuses IMU, odometer, and raw GNSS\nmeasurements (pseudo-range, carrier-phase, and Doppler) within an extendable\nfactor graph optimization (FGO) framework, incorporating outlier mitigation and\nambiguity resolution. Observability analysis reveals that two horizontal\ntranslation and three rotation parameters are observable under general motion,\nwhile vertical translation remains unobservable. Simulation and real-world\nexperiments demonstrate superior calibration and localization performance over\nstate-of-the-art loosely coupled methods. Specifically, the IMU-odometer\npositioning using our calibrated parameters achieves the absolute maximum error\nof 17.75 m while the one of LC method is 61.51 m, achieving up to 71.14 percent\nimprovement. To foster further research, we also release the first open-source\ndataset that combines IMU, 2D odometer, and raw GNSS measurements from both\nrover and base stations."
