      "summary": "Large-scale data has driven breakthroughs in robotics, from language models\nto vision-language-action models in bimanual manipulation. However, humanoid\nrobotics lacks equally effective data collection frameworks. Existing humanoid\nteleoperation systems either use decoupled control or depend on expensive\nmotion capture setups. We introduce TWIST2, a portable, mocap-free humanoid\nteleoperation and data collection system that preserves full whole-body control\nwhile advancing scalability. Our system leverages PICO4U VR for obtaining\nreal-time whole-body human motions, with a custom 2-DoF robot neck (cost around\n$250) for egocentric vision, enabling holistic human-to-humanoid control. We\ndemonstrate long-horizon dexterous and mobile humanoid skills and we can\ncollect 100 demonstrations in 15 minutes with an almost 100% success rate.\nBuilding on this pipeline, we propose a hierarchical visuomotor policy\nframework that autonomously controls the full humanoid body based on egocentric\nvision. Our visuomotor policy successfully demonstrates whole-body dexterous\nmanipulation and dynamic kicking tasks. The entire system is fully reproducible\nand open-sourced at https://yanjieze.com/TWIST2 . Our collected dataset is also\nopen-sourced at https://twist-data.github.io ."

      "summary": "We propose DenseMarks - a new learned representation for human heads,\nenabling high-quality dense correspondences of human head images. For a 2D\nimage of a human head, a Vision Transformer network predicts a 3D embedding for\neach pixel, which corresponds to a location in a 3D canonical unit cube. In\norder to train our network, we collect a dataset of pairwise point matches,\nestimated by a state-of-the-art point tracker over a collection of diverse\nin-the-wild talking heads videos, and guide the mapping via a contrastive loss,\nencouraging matched points to have close embeddings. We further employ\nmulti-task learning with face landmarks and segmentation constraints, as well\nas imposing spatial continuity of embeddings through latent cube features,\nwhich results in an interpretable and queryable canonical space. The\nrepresentation can be used for finding common semantic parts, face/head\ntracking, and stereo reconstruction. Due to the strong supervision, our method\nis robust to pose variations and covers the entire head, including hair.\nAdditionally, the canonical space bottleneck makes sure the obtained\nrepresentations are consistent across diverse poses and individuals. We\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and\nmonocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models. The code and the model\ncheckpoint will be made available to the public."

We share two complementary Vision Transformer\narchitectures in the PLUTO-4 family: a compact and efficient PLUTO-4S model\noptimized for multi-scale deployment using a FlexiViT setup with 2D-RoPE\nembeddings, and a frontier-scale PLUTO-4G model trained with a single patch\nsize to maximize representation capacity and stability.

These limitations hinder fair\ncomparison, obscure true robustness, and restrict deployment in\nsecurity-critical applications. This paper introduces a unified benchmarking\nframework for systematic evaluation of forensic methods under controlled and\nreproducible conditions. We benchmark ten SoTA forensic methods (scratch,\nfrozen, and fine-tuned) and seven publicly available datasets (GAN and\ndiffusion) to perform extensive and systematic evaluations. We evaluate\nperformance using multiple metrics, including accuracy, average precision,\nROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity. We also further analyze model\ninterpretability using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps. Our evaluations\ndemonstrate substantial variability in generalization, with certain methods\nexhibiting strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model\ntransferability. This study aims to guide the research community toward a\ndeeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of current forensic\napproaches, and to inspire the development of more robust, generalizable, and\nexplainable solutions."

      "summary": "We propose MIRA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate models in scenarios\nwhere generating intermediate visual images is essential for successful\nreasoning. Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in\nMIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as\nsketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning\nprocess. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through\n\"drawing to think\". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically\nchallenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning\nsteps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our\nevaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems,\nannotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a\nunified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation\ninput: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with\nimage and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image\nclues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity\non our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under\ndifferent k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large\nlanguage models, including strongest private models as well as strong\nopen-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts.\nHowever, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves\nconsistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and\ntasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and\ndesigning textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited\nimprovements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the\ncritical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning\non MIRA."

Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks\nsuch as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding\nunderexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG\ncode as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We\nintroduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code\ngeneration: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic\nmeaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general\ncommonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric\nperception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel\nevaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered\nSVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,\nfrontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap\nbetween language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we\nintroduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)\nThinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines\nSVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply\nstructured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic\ncapacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities\nscore well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D\nreasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing\nClaude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on\nrendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual\nrepresentation.

We develop a unified base model for reconstructing view-consistent 3D\nheads from a single input image. The model employs a dual-branch encoder\nfollowed by a ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features into 3D space through\niterative cross-attention. Rendering is performed using Gaussian Splatting. At\nthe heart of our approach is a novel perceptual supervision strategy based on\nDINOv2 and SAM2.1, which provides rich, generalized signals for both geometric\nand appearance fidelity. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nnovel-view synthesis and, furthermore, exhibits exceptional robustness to\nextreme viewing angles compared to established baselines. Furthermore, this\nbase model can be seamlessly extended for semantic 3D editing by swapping the\nencoder and finetuning the network. In this variant, we disentangle geometry\nand style through two distinct input modalities: a segmentation map to control\ngeometry and either a text prompt or a reference image to specify appearance.\nWe highlight the intuitive and powerful 3D editing capabilities of our model\nthrough a lightweight, interactive GUI, where users can effortlessly sculpt\ngeometry by drawing segmentation maps and stylize appearance via natural\nlanguage or image prompts.\n  Project Page: https://antoniooroz.github.io/PercHead Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hFybgTk4kE"

However,\nexisting VLA models still face two fundamental challenges: (i) producing\nprecise low-level actions from high-dimensional observations, (ii) bridging\ndomain gaps across heterogeneous data sources, including diverse robot\nembodiments and human demonstrations. Existing methods often encode latent\nvariables from either visual dynamics or robotic actions to guide policy\nlearning, but they fail to fully exploit the complementary multi-modal\nknowledge present in large-scale, heterogeneous datasets. In this work, we\npresent X Robotic Model 1 (XR-1), a novel framework for versatile and scalable\nVLA learning across diverse robots, tasks, and environments. XR-1 introduces\nthe \\emph{Unified Vision-Motion Codes (UVMC)}, a discrete latent representation\nlearned via a dual-branch VQ-VAE that jointly encodes visual dynamics and\nrobotic motion. UVMC addresses these challenges by (i) serving as an\nintermediate representation between the observations and actions, and (ii)\naligning multimodal dynamic information from heterogeneous data sources to\ncapture complementary knowledge. To effectively exploit UVMC, we propose a\nthree-stage training paradigm: (i) self-supervised UVMC learning, (ii)\nUVMC-guided pretraining on large-scale cross-embodiment robotic datasets, and\n(iii) task-specific post-training. We validate XR-1 through extensive\nreal-world experiments with more than 14,000 rollouts on six different robot\nembodiments, spanning over 120 diverse manipulation tasks. XR-1 consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as $\\pi_{0.5}$, $\\pi_0$, RDT,\nUniVLA, and GR00T-N1.5 while demonstrating strong generalization to novel\nobjects, background variations, distractors, and illumination changes.

We propose parametric\ntest-time scaling laws that capture this behavior and show remarkable\npredictive power against empirical observations. Secondly, we investigate the\ncorrelation between semantic alignment and performance on both semantic and\nnon-semantic downstream tasks, providing initial evidence that strong alignment\nagainst text encoders may be linked to general-purpose video representation and\nunderstanding. Finally, we correlate temporal reasoning with cross-modal\nalignment providing a challenging test-bed for vision and language models.\nOverall, our work introduces video-text alignment as an informative zero-shot\nway to probe the representation power of different encoders for spatio-temporal\ndata.

Prior works\nsuggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be\nattributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance\npropagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find\nimages that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are\nlargely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered\nconcepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting\nthe accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.\n  To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept\nRelevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a\nmultimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive\nnames to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that\ntranslate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To\nensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the\nsemantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and\nexplanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences,\noffering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries\nfor non-technical stakeholders.\n  We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a\nVGG16 model.

In this work, we present UniPruneBench, a unified and\nextensible benchmark for visual token pruning in multimodal LLMs. UniPruneBench\nprovides standardized protocols across six ability dimensions and ten datasets,\ncovering ten representative compression algorithms and three families of LMMs\n(LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, and Qwen2.5-VL). Beyond task accuracy, it incorporates\nsystem-level metrics such as runtime and prefilling latency to provide a\nholistic view. Our experiments uncover several key findings: (1) random pruning\nis a surprisingly strong baseline, (2) no single method consistently\noutperforms others across scenarios, (3) pruning sensitivity varies\nsignificantly across tasks, with OCR being most vulnerable, and (4) pruning\nratio is the dominant factor governing performance degradation. We believe\nUniPruneBench will serve as a reliable foundation for future research on\nefficient multimodal modeling."

This constraint leads to poor generalization\nand limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We\nleverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop\nUniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange\nintegrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities.\nOur model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction\nof three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange\nutilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories,\neliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows\nUniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even\nwhen their class definitions conflict.

For the visual task, SFT\nand ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by\ncontext-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of\n0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the\nsuperior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a\npowerful \"super-expert\" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm\nthe superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual\ninterference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked\nagainst strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer\nkey observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our\nbenchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for\ndeveloping more effective science-based agentic systems."

However, in GNSS-denied areas,\nsatellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents\na cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object\ndetection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view,\nheterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual\nlocalization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are\nextracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is\nestimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because\npublicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches\nrecast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these\ndatasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain\ndifferences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations,\nor generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment,\ncontent loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object\ndetection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite\nimages, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and\nintra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based\nnode-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization\nperformance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that\nour approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and\ngeneralizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps,\nsuch as infrared-visible image matching.

In this\ntask, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by\ncombining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising\ncooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods\nfocus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire\nvideo, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action\nrecognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized\nsequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action\nrecognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we\nintroduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast\nto previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial\ninformation, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in\nthe STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our\nmodule, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model\nthe relationship between multiple views effectively.

To address this challenge, we introduce HAGI++ - a\nmulti-modal diffusion-based approach for gaze data imputation that, for the\nfirst time, uses the integrated head orientation sensors to exploit the\ninherent correlation between head and eye movements. HAGI++ employs a\ntransformer-based diffusion model to learn cross-modal dependencies between eye\nand head representations and can be readily extended to incorporate additional\nbody movements. Extensive evaluations on the large-scale Nymeria, Ego-Exo4D,\nand HOT3D datasets demonstrate that HAGI++ consistently outperforms\nconventional interpolation methods and deep learning-based time-series\nimputation baselines in gaze imputation. Furthermore, statistical analyses\nconfirm that HAGI++ produces gaze velocity distributions that closely match\nactual human gaze behaviour, ensuring more realistic gaze imputations.\nMoreover, by incorporating wrist motion captured from commercial wearable\ndevices, HAGI++ surpasses prior methods that rely on full-body motion capture\nin the extreme case of 100% missing gaze data (pure gaze generation).

To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous\nVision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that\nleverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.\nThe core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent\nQ-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a\nchain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this\nprocess, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual\nregions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain\ngrounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines\ncontrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment\nbetween latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.\nEvaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong\nbaselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B\nmodels on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that\nlearned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns,\nhighlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between\ndiscrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding."

To address this limitation, we propose Global-Aware\nFeature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration (GAFD-CC). GAFD-CC aims to\nrefine decision boundaries and increase discriminative performance. Firstly, it\nperforms global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights. This\ninvolves aligning features with the direction of global classification weights\nto decouple them. From this, GAFD-CC extracts two types of critical\ninformation: positively correlated features that promote in-distribution\n(ID)/OOD boundary refinement and negatively correlated features that suppress\nfalse positives and tighten these boundaries. Secondly, it adaptively fuses\nthese decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for\ncomprehensive and robust OOD detection.

We\nintroduce LACY (Language-Action Cycle), a unified framework that learns such\nbidirectional mappings within a single vision-language model. LACY is jointly\ntrained on three synergistic tasks: generating parameterized actions from\nlanguage (L2A), explaining observed actions in language (A2L), and verifying\nsemantic consistency between two language descriptions (L2C). This enables a\nself-improving cycle that autonomously generates and filters new training data\nthrough an active augmentation strategy targeting low-confidence cases, thereby\nimproving the model without additional human labels.

      "summary": "Strawberries are among the most economically significant fruits in the United\nStates, generating over $2 billion in annual farm-gate sales and accounting for\napproximately 13% of the total fruit production value. Plant phenotyping plays\na vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits\nsuch as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional\nplant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often\ndestructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance\nFields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful\nframeworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of\nmulti-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable\nnon-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their\npromise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct\nthe entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise,\nincreases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction\nframework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment\nAnything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean\nstrawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate\ngeometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With\na background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate\nimportant plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN\nclustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experimental results show\nthat our method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and\nefficiency, offering a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry\nplant phenotyping."

      "summary": "Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis heavily relies on amyloid-beta\npositron emission tomography (Abeta-PET), which is limited by high cost and\nlimited accessibility. This study explores whether Abeta-PET spatial patterns\ncan be predicted from blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) and MRI scans. Methods: We\ncollected Abeta-PET images, T1-weighted MRI scans, and BBMs from 566\nparticipants. A language-enhanced generative model, driven by a large language\nmodel (LLM) and multimodal information fusion, was developed to synthesize PET\nimages. Synthesized images were evaluated for image quality, diagnostic\nconsistency, and clinical applicability within a fully automated diagnostic\npipeline. Findings: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans in\nboth structural details (SSIM = 0.920 +/- 0.003) and regional patterns\n(Pearson's r = 0.955 +/- 0.007). Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show\nhigh agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80). Using synthetic\nPET, we developed a fully automatic AD diagnostic pipeline integrating PET\nsynthesis and classification. The synthetic PET-based model (AUC = 0.78)\noutperforms T1-based (AUC = 0.68) and BBM-based (AUC = 0.73) models, while\ncombining synthetic PET and BBMs further improved performance (AUC = 0.79).\nAblation analysis supports the advantages of LLM integration and prompt\nengineering. Interpretation: Our language-enhanced generative model synthesizes\nrealistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and BBMs for Abeta spatial\npattern assessment and improving the diagnostic workflow for Alzheimer's\ndisease."

We propose\nOmniField, a continuity-aware framework that learns a continuous neural field\nconditioned on available modalities and iteratively fuses cross-modal context.\nA multimodal crosstalk block architecture paired with iterative cross-modal\nrefinement aligns signals prior to the decoder, enabling unified\nreconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction without\ngridding or surrogate preprocessing.

Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal\nvessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the\nquantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature\ndiffers significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it\nconsists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology\nvaries greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges\nto segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose\nMM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel\nsegmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which\nreplace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception\nthrough morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective\nState Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space\nmodeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.\nExtensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation\ndatasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in\nsegmentation accuracy. Compared to the existing approaches, MM-UNet achieves\nF1-score gains of 1.64 $\\%$ on DRIVE and 1.25 $\\%$ on STARE, demonstrating its\neffectiveness and advancement.

      "summary": "This paper presents a quantitative comparison between centralised and\ndistributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) architectures for\ncontrolling a soft robotic arm modelled as a Cosserat rod in simulation. Using\nPyElastica and the OpenAI Gym interface, we train both a global Proximal Policy\nOptimisation (PPO) controller and a Multi-Agent PPO (MAPPO) under identical\nbudgets. Both approaches are based on the arm having $n$ number of controlled\nsections. The study systematically varies $n$ and evaluates the performance of\nthe arm to reach a fixed target in three scenarios: default baseline condition,\nrecovery from external disturbance, and adaptation to actuator failure.\nQuantitative metrics used for the evaluation are mean action magnitude, mean\nfinal distance, mean episode length, and success rate. The results show that\nthere are no significant benefits of the distributed policy when the number of\ncontrolled sections $n\\le4$. In very simple systems, when $n\\le2$, the\ncentralised policy outperforms the distributed one. When $n$ increases to $4<\nn\\le 12$, the distributed policy shows a high sample efficiency. In these\nsystems, distributed policy promotes a stronger success rate, resilience, and\nrobustness under local observability and yields faster convergence given the\nsame sample size. However, centralised policies achieve much higher time\nefficiency during training as it takes much less time to train the same size of\nsamples. These findings highlight the trade-offs between centralised and\ndistributed policy in reinforcement learning-based control for soft robotic\nsystems and provide actionable design guidance for future sim-to-real transfer\nin soft rod-like manipulators."

To achieve this capability, our proposed\napproach decomposes the GVQA task into a three-stage pipeline: (1) Video\nReasoning \\& QA, (2) Spatio-temporal Grounding and (3) Tracking. Our key\ncontribution is the introduction of a trigger moment, derived from our proposed\nCORTEX prompt, which pinpoints the single most visible frame of a target object\nto serve as a robust anchor for grounding and tracking.

This paper introduces an innovative autonomous mechanism\nfor tuning the biases of event cameras, effectively addressing flicker across a\nwide frequency range -25 Hz to 500 Hz. Unlike traditional methods that rely on\nadditional hardware or software for flicker filtering, our approach leverages\nthe event cameras inherent bias settings. Utilizing a simple Convolutional\nNeural Networks -CNNs, the system identifies instances of flicker in a spatial\nspace and dynamically adjusts specific biases to minimize its impact. The\nefficacy of this autobiasing system was robustly tested using a face detector\nframework under both well-lit and low-light conditions, as well as across\nvarious frequencies. The results demonstrated significant improvements:\nenhanced YOLO confidence metrics for face detection, and an increased\npercentage of frames capturing detected faces. Moreover, the average gradient,\nwhich serves as an indicator of flicker presence through edge detection,\ndecreased by 38.2 percent in well-lit conditions and by 53.6 percent in\nlow-light conditions.
