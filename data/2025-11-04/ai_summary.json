However, humanoid\nrobotics lacks equally effective data collection frameworks. Existing humanoid\nteleoperation systems either use decoupled control or depend on expensive\nmotion capture setups. We introduce TWIST2, a portable, mocap-free humanoid\nteleoperation and data collection system that preserves full whole-body control\nwhile advancing scalability. Our system leverages PICO4U VR for obtaining\nreal-time whole-body human motions, with a custom 2-DoF robot neck (cost around\n$250) for egocentric vision, enabling holistic human-to-humanoid control. We\ndemonstrate long-horizon dexterous and mobile humanoid skills and we can\ncollect 100 demonstrations in 15 minutes with an almost 100% success rate.\nBuilding on this pipeline, we propose a hierarchical visuomotor policy\nframework that autonomously controls the full humanoid body based on egocentric\nvision. Our visuomotor policy successfully demonstrates whole-body dexterous\nmanipulation and dynamic kicking tasks.

In\norder to train our network, we collect a dataset of pairwise point matches,\nestimated by a state-of-the-art point tracker over a collection of diverse\nin-the-wild talking heads videos, and guide the mapping via a contrastive loss,\nencouraging matched points to have close embeddings. We further employ\nmulti-task learning with face landmarks and segmentation constraints, as well\nas imposing spatial continuity of embeddings through latent cube features,\nwhich results in an interpretable and queryable canonical space. The\nrepresentation can be used for finding common semantic parts, face/head\ntracking, and stereo reconstruction. Due to the strong supervision, our method\nis robust to pose variations and covers the entire head, including hair.\nAdditionally, the canonical space bottleneck makes sure the obtained\nrepresentations are consistent across diverse poses and individuals.

These limitations hinder fair\ncomparison, obscure true robustness, and restrict deployment in\nsecurity-critical applications. This paper introduces a unified benchmarking\nframework for systematic evaluation of forensic methods under controlled and\nreproducible conditions. We benchmark ten SoTA forensic methods (scratch,\nfrozen, and fine-tuned) and seven publicly available datasets (GAN and\ndiffusion) to perform extensive and systematic evaluations. We evaluate\nperformance using multiple metrics, including accuracy, average precision,\nROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity. We also further analyze model\ninterpretability using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps. Our evaluations\ndemonstrate substantial variability in generalization, with certain methods\nexhibiting strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model\ntransferability.

Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in\nMIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as\nsketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning\nprocess. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through\n\"drawing to think\". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically\nchallenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning\nsteps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our\nevaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems,\nannotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a\nunified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation\ninput: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with\nimage and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image\nclues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity\non our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under\ndifferent k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large\nlanguage models, including strongest private models as well as strong\nopen-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts.\nHowever, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves\nconsistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and\ntasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and\ndesigning textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited\nimprovements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the\ncritical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning\non MIRA.",

Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks\nsuch as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding\nunderexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG\ncode as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We\nintroduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code\ngeneration: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic\nmeaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general\ncommonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric\nperception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel\nevaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered\nSVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,\nfrontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap\nbetween language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we\nintroduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)\nThinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines\nSVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply\nstructured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic\ncapacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities\nscore well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D\nreasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing\nClaude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on\nrendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual\nrepresentation.

            "summary": "Recent progress in large-scale robotic datasets and vision-language models\n(VLMs) has advanced research on vision-language-action (VLA) models. However,\nexisting VLA models still face two fundamental challenges: (i) producing\nprecise low-level actions from high-dimensional observations, (ii) bridging\ndomain gaps across heterogeneous data sources, including diverse robot\nembodiments and human demonstrations. Existing methods often encode latent\nvariables from either visual dynamics or robotic actions to guide policy\nlearning, but they fail to fully exploit the complementary multi-modal\nknowledge present in large-scale, heterogeneous datasets. In this work, we\npresent X Robotic Model 1 (XR-1), a novel framework for versatile and scalable\nVLA learning across diverse robots, tasks, and environments. XR-1 introduces\nthe \\emph{Unified Vision-Motion Codes (UVMC)}, a discrete latent representation\nlearned via a dual-branch VQ-VAE that jointly encodes visual dynamics and\nrobotic motion. UVMC addresses these challenges by (i) serving as an\nintermediate representation between the observations and actions, and (ii)\naligning multimodal dynamic information from heterogeneous data sources to\ncapture complementary knowledge. To effectively exploit UVMC, we propose a\nthree-stage training paradigm: (i) self-supervised UVMC learning, (ii)\nUVMC-guided pretraining on large-scale cross-embodiment robotic datasets, and\n(iii) task-specific post-training. We validate XR-1 through extensive\nreal-world experiments with more than 14,000 rollouts on six different robot\nembodiments, spanning over 120 diverse manipulation tasks. XR-1 consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as $\\pi_{0.5}$, $\\pi_0$, RDT,\nUniVLA, and GR00T-N1.5 while demonstrating strong generalization to novel\nobjects, background variations, distractors, and illumination changes.

While significant\nprogress has been made in aligning images with text, the temporal nature of\nvideo data remains largely unexplored in this context. In this work, we conduct\nthe first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, probing\nthe capabilities of modern video and language encoders. Our findings reveal\nseveral key insights. First, we demonstrate that cross-modal alignment highly\ndepends on the richness of both visual (static images vs. multi-frame videos)\nand text (single caption vs. a collection) data provided at test time,\nespecially when using state-of-the-art video encoders. We propose parametric\ntest-time scaling laws that capture this behavior and show remarkable\npredictive power against empirical observations. Secondly, we investigate the\ncorrelation between semantic alignment and performance on both semantic and\nnon-semantic downstream tasks, providing initial evidence that strong alignment\nagainst text encoders may be linked to general-purpose video representation and\nunderstanding. Finally, we correlate temporal reasoning with cross-modal\nalignment providing a challenging test-bed for vision and language models.\nOverall, our work introduces video-text alignment as an informative zero-shot\nway to probe the representation power of different encoders for spatio-temporal\ndata.

With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to\nexplain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works\nsuggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be\nattributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance\npropagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find\nimages that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are\nlargely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered\nconcepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting\nthe accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.\n  To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept\nRelevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a\nmultimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive\nnames to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that\ntranslate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To\nensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the\nsemantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and\nexplanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences,\noffering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries\nfor non-technical stakeholders.\n  We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a\nVGG16 model.

While recent high performance models and high quality datasets\nhave significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current\nmodels typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and\ncannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic\nchange detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization\nand limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We\nleverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop\nUniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange\nintegrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities.\nOur model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction\nof three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange\nutilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories,\neliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows\nUniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even\nwhen their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks\n(WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance,\nachieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively,\nsurpassing all previous methods.

To address this, we introduce the\nTraining-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a\nnovel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation.

Extensive experiments show that our\ntraining-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods,\nenhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and\nfidelity.

Instead, here we\ninvestigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a\nparticipant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically\nmodeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We\nimplement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR,\nTime-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL).\nPredicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans\nusing metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best\nperforming models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize\nwell to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort\nperformance.

To reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation, this\nstudy explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in\nshearographic images. Three architectures are evaluated: a fully connected\nautoencoder, a convolutional autoencoder, and a student-teacher feature\nmatching model. All models are trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled\ndataset was developed using a custom specimen with reproducible defect\npatterns, enabling systematic acquisition of shearographic measurements under\nboth ideal and realistic deformation conditions. Two training subsets were\ndefined: one containing only undistorted, defect-free samples, and one\nadditionally including globally deformed, yet defect-free, data. The latter\nsimulates practical inspection conditions by incorporating deformation-induced\nfringe patterns that may obscure localized anomalies. The models are evaluated\nin terms of binary classification and, for the student-teacher model, spatial\ndefect localization. Results show that the student-teacher approach achieves\nsuperior classification robustness and enables precise localization. Compared\nto the autoencoder-based models, it demonstrates improved separability of\nfeature representations, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings.

Each interceptor is\nguided toward its assigned VT using Zero-Effort-Miss guidance during midcourse\nflight, transitioning to Proportional Navigation guidance for terminal\ninterception. This approach treats many-vs-many engagements as\nmany-vs-distribution scenarios, exploiting numerical superiority (n > m) by\ndistributing interceptors across diverse trajectory hypotheses rather than\npursuing identical deterministic predictions. Monte Carlo simulations across\nvarious target-interceptor configurations (1-6 targets, 1-8 interceptors)\ndemonstrate that the VT method matches or exceeds baseline straight-line\nprediction performance by 0-4.1% when n = m, with improvements increasing to\n5.8-14.4% when n > m.

While current intelligent video\nediting technologies can handle some automated video editing tasks, they often\nfail to capture the creator's unique artistic expression in shot assembly.To\naddress this challenge, we propose an energy-based optimization method for\nvideo shot assembly. Specifically, we first perform visual-semantic matching\nbetween the script generated by a large language model and a video library to\nobtain subsets of candidate shots aligned with the script semantics. Next, we\nsegment and label the shots from reference videos, extracting attributes such\nas shot size, camera motion, and semantics. We then employ energy-based models\nto learn from these attributes, scoring candidate shot sequences based on their\nalignment with reference styles. Finally, we achieve shot assembly optimization\nby combining multiple syntax rules, producing videos that align with the\nassembly style of the reference videos. Our method not only automates the\narrangement and combination of independent shots according to specific logic,\nnarrative requirements, or artistic styles but also learns the assembly style\nof reference videos, creating a coherent visual sequence or holistic visual\nexpression.

However, in GNSS-denied areas,\nsatellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents\na cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object\ndetection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view,\nheterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual\nlocalization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are\nextracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is\nestimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because\npublicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches\nrecast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these\ndatasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain\ndifferences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations,\nor generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment,\ncontent loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object\ndetection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite\nimages, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and\nintra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based\nnode-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization\nperformance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that\nour approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and\ngeneralizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps,\nsuch as infrared-visible image matching.

In this\ntask, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by\ncombining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising\ncooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods\nfocus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire\nvideo, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action\nrecognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized\nsequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action\nrecognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we\nintroduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast\nto previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial\ninformation, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in\nthe STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our\nmodule, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model\nthe relationship between multiple views effectively. The results of experiments\nusing a newly collected dataset demonstrate that MVAFormer outperforms the\ncomparison baselines by approximately $4.4$ points on the F-measure.",

However, missing values due to blinks, pupil\ndetection errors, or illumination changes pose significant challenges for\nfurther gaze data analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce HAGI++ - a\nmulti-modal diffusion-based approach for gaze data imputation that, for the\nfirst time, uses the integrated head orientation sensors to exploit the\ninherent correlation between head and eye movements. HAGI++ employs a\ntransformer-based diffusion model to learn cross-modal dependencies between eye\nand head representations and can be readily extended to incorporate additional\nbody movements. Extensive evaluations on the large-scale Nymeria, Ego-Exo4D,\nand HOT3D datasets demonstrate that HAGI++ consistently outperforms\nconventional interpolation methods and deep learning-based time-series\nimputation baselines in gaze imputation. Furthermore, statistical analyses\nconfirm that HAGI++ produces gaze velocity distributions that closely match\nactual human gaze behaviour, ensuring more realistic gaze imputations.\nMoreover, by incorporating wrist motion captured from commercial wearable\ndevices, HAGI++ surpasses prior methods that rely on full-body motion capture\nin the extreme case of 100% missing gaze data (pure gaze generation). Our\nmethod paves the way for more complete and accurate eye gaze recordings in\nreal-world settings and has significant potential for enhancing gaze-based\nanalysis and interaction across various application domains.",

Specifically, we first decompose an input image into\nreflectance and illumination components following Retinex theory. To model the\nwide dynamic range of illumination variations in low-light images, we propose a\nconditional rectified flow framework that represents illumination changes as a\ncontinuous flow field.

Our algorithm begins by estimating\nthe overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and\nthen adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close\nproximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups,\nnamely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated\noverlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target\npoints in Gcl, a K-nearest neighbors based bilateral interpolation (KBI) method\nis proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the\nhistogram equalization (JKHE) method is proposed. For target points in Gdist, a\nhistogram equalization (HE) method is proposed for color correction. Finally,\nwe discuss the grouping-effect free property and the ablation study in our\nalgorithm.

Radar sensors overcome this\nproblem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler\nvelocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation.\nHowever, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation\nfor use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and\ncost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of\nself-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point\nclouds.

To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous\nVision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that\nleverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.\nThe core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent\nQ-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a\nchain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this\nprocess, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual\nregions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain\ngrounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines\ncontrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment\nbetween latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.\nEvaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong\nbaselines.

Yet\nplanning safe, dynamically feasible trajectories remains difficult due to\nwhole-body collision avoidance and the conservativeness of common geometric\nabstractions such as bounding boxes or ellipsoids. We present a whole-body\nmotion planning and safety-critical control framework for aerial manipulators\nbuilt on superquadrics (SQs). Using an SQ-plus-proxy representation, we model\nboth the vehicle and obstacles with differentiable, geometry-accurate surfaces.\nLeveraging this representation, we introduce a maximum-clearance planner that\nfuses Voronoi diagrams with an equilibrium-manifold formulation to generate\nsmooth, collision-aware trajectories. We further design a safety-critical\ncontroller that jointly enforces thrust limits and collision avoidance via\nhigh-order control barrier functions. In simulation, our approach outperforms\nsampling-based planners in cluttered environments, producing faster, safer, and\nsmoother trajectories and exceeding ellipsoid-based baselines in geometric\nfidelity. Actual experiments on a physical aerial-manipulation platform confirm\nfeasibility and robustness, demonstrating consistent performance across\nsimulation and hardware settings.

Existing post-hoc\nOOD detection methods detect OOD samples by leveraging their features and\nlogits information without retraining. However, they often overlook the\ninherent correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for\neffective OOD detection. To address this limitation, we propose Global-Aware\nFeature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration (GAFD-CC). GAFD-CC aims to\nrefine decision boundaries and increase discriminative performance. Firstly, it\nperforms global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights. This\ninvolves aligning features with the direction of global classification weights\nto decouple them. From this, GAFD-CC extracts two types of critical\ninformation: positively correlated features that promote in-distribution\n(ID)/OOD boundary refinement and negatively correlated features that suppress\nfalse positives and tighten these boundaries. Secondly, it adaptively fuses\nthese decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for\ncomprehensive and robust OOD detection. Extensive experiments on large-scale\nbenchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong\ngeneralization ability compared to those of state-of-the-art methods.",

Specifically, through joint\nstructure design and optimization and based on a multi-material integrated\ncasting technique, a camera and light source are embedded into the sucker,\nwhich enables in-situ, high-density perception of fine details like surface\nshape, texture and roughness. To further enhance robustness and adaptability,\nthe sucker's mechanical design is also optimized by refining its profile,\nadding a compliant lip, and incorporating surface microstructure.

However, obtaining absolute (metric) depth from an endoscopy\ncamera in surgical scenes is difficult, which limits supervised learning of\ndepth on real endoscopic images. Current image-level unsupervised domain\nadaptation methods translate synthetic images with known depth maps into the\nstyle of real endoscopic frames and train depth networks using these translated\nimages with their corresponding depth maps. However a domain gap often remains\nbetween real and translated synthetic images. In this paper, we present a\nlatent feature alignment method to improve absolute depth estimation by\nreducing this domain gap in the context of endoscopic videos of the central\nairway. Our methods are agnostic to the image translation process and focus on\nthe depth estimation itself. Specifically, the depth network takes translated\nsynthetic and real endoscopic frames as input and learns latent\ndomain-invariant features via adversarial learning and directional feature\nconsistency. The evaluation is conducted on endoscopic videos of central airway\nphantoms with manually aligned absolute depth maps. Compared to\nstate-of-the-art MDE methods, our approach achieves superior performance on\nboth absolute and relative depth metrics, and consistently improves results\nacross various backbones and pretrained weights.

However,\nthis one-way paradigm often produces policies that execute tasks without deeper\ncontextual understanding, limiting their ability to generalize or explain their\nbehavior. We argue that the complementary skill of mapping actions back to\nlanguage (A2L) is essential for developing more holistic grounding. An agent\ncapable of both acting and explaining its actions can form richer internal\nrepresentations and unlock new paradigms for self-supervised learning. We\nintroduce LACY (Language-Action Cycle), a unified framework that learns such\nbidirectional mappings within a single vision-language model. LACY is jointly\ntrained on three synergistic tasks: generating parameterized actions from\nlanguage (L2A), explaining observed actions in language (A2L), and verifying\nsemantic consistency between two language descriptions (L2C). This enables a\nself-improving cycle that autonomously generates and filters new training data\nthrough an active augmentation strategy targeting low-confidence cases, thereby\nimproving the model without additional human labels. Experiments on\npick-and-place tasks in both simulation and the real world show that LACY\nimproves task success rates by 56.46% on average and yields more robust\nlanguage-action grounding for robotic manipulation.

To reflect realistic MPI conditions, the system matrix is\ndegraded using a dual-stage downsampling strategy. Training employed\npaired-image super-resolution on the public Open MPI dataset and a simulated\ndataset incorporating variable coil sensitivity profiles. For system matrix\nrecovery on the Open MPI dataset, VRF-Net achieved nRMSE = 0.403, pSNR = 39.08\ndB, and SSIM = 0.835 at 2x scaling, and maintained strong performance even at\nchallenging scale 8x (pSNR = 31.06 dB, SSIM = 0.717). For the simulated\ndataset, VRF-Net achieved nRMSE = 4.44, pSNR = 28.52 dB, and SSIM = 0.771 at 2x\nscaling, with stable performance at higher scales. On average, it reduced nRMSE\nby 88.2%, increased pSNR by 44.7%, and improved SSIM by 34.3% over\ninterpolation and CNN-based methods.

Plant phenotyping plays\na vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits\nsuch as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional\nplant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often\ndestructive.

We propose\nOmniField, a continuity-aware framework that learns a continuous neural field\nconditioned on available modalities and iteratively fuses cross-modal context.\nA multimodal crosstalk block architecture paired with iterative cross-modal\nrefinement aligns signals prior to the decoder, enabling unified\nreconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction without\ngridding or surrogate preprocessing. Extensive evaluations show that OmniField\nconsistently outperforms eight strong multimodal spatiotemporal baselines.\nUnder heavy simulated sensor noise, performance remains close to clean-input\nlevels, highlighting robustness to corrupted measurements.",

Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal\nvessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the\nquantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature\ndiffers significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it\nconsists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology\nvaries greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges\nto segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose\nMM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel\nsegmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which\nreplace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception\nthrough morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective\nState Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space\nmodeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.\nExtensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation\ndatasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in\nsegmentation accuracy. Compared to the existing approaches, MM-UNet achieves\nF1-score gains of 1.64 $\\%$ on DRIVE and 1.25 $\\%$ on STARE, demonstrating its\neffectiveness and advancement.

Using\nPyElastica and the OpenAI Gym interface, we train both a global Proximal Policy\nOptimisation (PPO) controller and a Multi-Agent PPO (MAPPO) under identical\nbudgets. Both approaches are based on the arm having $n$ number of controlled\nsections. The study systematically varies $n$ and evaluates the performance of\nthe arm to reach a fixed target in three scenarios: default baseline condition,\nrecovery from external disturbance, and adaptation to actuator failure.\nQuantitative metrics used for the evaluation are mean action magnitude, mean\nfinal distance, mean episode length, and success rate. The results show that\nthere are no significant benefits of the distributed policy when the number of\ncontrolled sections $n\\le4$. In very simple systems, when $n\\le2$, the\ncentralised policy outperforms the distributed one. When $n$ increases to $4<\nn\\le 12$, the distributed policy shows a high sample efficiency. In these\nsystems, distributed policy promotes a stronger success rate, resilience, and\nrobustness under local observability and yields faster convergence given the\nsame sample size. However, centralised policies achieve much higher time\nefficiency during training as it takes much less time to train the same size of\nsamples. These findings highlight the trade-offs between centralised and\ndistributed policy in reinforcement learning-based control for soft robotic\nsystems and provide actionable design guidance for future sim-to-real transfer\nin soft rod-like manipulators.",

Unlike traditional methods that rely on\nadditional hardware or software for flicker filtering, our approach leverages\nthe event cameras inherent bias settings. Utilizing a simple Convolutional\nNeural Networks -CNNs, the system identifies instances of flicker in a spatial\nspace and dynamically adjusts specific biases to minimize its impact.

The results demonstrated significant improvements:\nenhanced YOLO confidence metrics for face detection, and an increased\npercentage of frames capturing detected faces. Moreover, the average gradient,\nwhich serves as an indicator of flicker presence through edge detection,\ndecreased by 38.2 percent in well-lit conditions and by 53.6 percent in\nlow-light conditions.
