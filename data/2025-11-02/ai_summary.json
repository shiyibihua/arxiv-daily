We present LifWavNet,\na lifting wavelet network based on a multi-resolution analysis and synthesis\n(MRAS) model for radar-to-ECG reconstruction. Unlike prior models that use\nfixed wavelet approaches, LifWavNet employs learnable lifting wavelets with\nlifting and inverse lifting units to adaptively capture radar signal features\nand synthesize physiologically meaningful ECG waveforms. To improve\nreconstruction fidelity, we introduce a multi-resolution short-time Fourier\ntransform (STFT) loss, that enforces consistency with the ground-truth ECG in\nboth temporal and spectral domains. Evaluations on two public datasets\ndemonstrate that LifWavNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ECG\nreconstruction and downstream vital sign estimation (heart rate and heart rate\nvariability). Furthermore, intermediate feature visualization highlights the\ninterpretability of multi-resolution decomposition and synthesis in\nradar-to-ECG reconstruction. These results establish LifWavNet as a robust\nframework for radar-based non-contact ECG measurement.",

However,\nlimited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex\ngenerative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video\ngeneration. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory\nusage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency.\nWhile prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential\nsolution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of\nmulti-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step\ncounterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step\ndistillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model\ncapacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution\nmatching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the\nSNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR\nlevels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training\nobjective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous\nmathematical derivations. We validate Phased DMD by distilling state-of-the-art\nimage and video generation models, including Qwen-Image (20B parameters) and\nWan2.2 (28B parameters). Experimental results demonstrate that Phased DMD\npreserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative\ncapabilities. We will release our code and models.",

To\naddress these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD).\nThrough analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD\nnot only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization,\nwhich enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the\nAI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box\nregression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across various detectors. We further validated the generalizability\nof GCD on the MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets, where it outperforms the\nWasserstein Distance across diverse scales of datasets.

Immutable\nheterogeneity poses a significant challenge in collaborative perception, as\nparticipating agents may employ different and fixed perception models. This\nleads to domain gaps in the intermediate features shared among agents,\nconsequently degrading collaborative performance. Aligning the features of all\nagents to a common representation can eliminate domain gaps with low training\ncost. However, in existing methods, the common representation is designated as\nthe representation of a specific agent, making it difficult for agents with\nsignificant domain discrepancies from this specific agent to achieve proper\nalignment. This paper proposes NegoCollab, a heterogeneous collaboration method\nbased on the negotiated common representation. It introduces a negotiator\nduring training to derive the common representation from the local\nrepresentations of each modality's agent, effectively reducing the inherent\ndomain gap with the various local representations. In NegoCollab, the mutual\ntransformation of features between the local representation space and the\ncommon representation space is achieved by a pair of sender and receiver. To\nbetter align local representations to the common representation containing\nmultimodal information, we introduce structural alignment loss and pragmatic\nalignment loss in addition to the distribution alignment loss to supervise the\ntraining. This enables the knowledge in the common representation to be fully\ndistilled into the sender.",

A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when\napplied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize\nthat leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and\nbranching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To\ninvestigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating\nlarge-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in\nsegmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular\ngeometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,\nencouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate\nthat a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot\nsegmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains,\nrequiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model\nexhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in\nunseen domains without any target-specific training.

However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack\nsurface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a\nvisual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an\nattacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to\ninject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in\nthe environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit\nwide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant\nreliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that\nspans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger\nvariability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning\n(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between\ntrigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision\nboundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent\nbenchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while\nmaintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to\nout-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL\nboosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.\nThese findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based\nembodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world\ndeployment.",

Foundation models provide powerful visual and\nmultimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional\nspaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by\nenabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing\napproaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs\nspecialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We\nintroduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle\nfor learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned\nviews. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate\nmaximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and\ndiverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP\nhashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced\ncodes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt\nencoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly\nwell-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes\nand supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU. These\nresults highlight CroVCA's efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability.",

Such datasets are essential for applications such as dating\nbuildings, analyzing the development of road networks and settlements, studying\nenvironmental changes etc. We present MapSAM2, a unified framework for\nautomatically segmenting both historical map images and time series. Built on a\nvisual foundation model, MapSAM2 adapts to diverse segmentation tasks with\nfew-shot fine-tuning. Our key innovation is to treat both historical map images\nand time series as videos.

For time series, we introduce the annotated Siegfried Building Time\nSeries Dataset and, to reduce annotation costs, propose generating pseudo time\nseries from single-year maps by simulating common temporal transformations.\nExperimental results show that MapSAM2 learns temporal associations effectively\nand can accurately segment and link buildings in time series under limited\nsupervision or using pseudo videos.

However, these approaches often suffer from high\ncomputational cost, exposure bias, and unstable inference dynamics, which lead\nto divergence under distribution shifts. Energy-Based Models (EBMs) address\nthese issues by learning energy landscapes end-to-end and modeling equilibrium\ndynamics, offering improved robustness and reduced exposure bias. Yet, policies\nparameterized by EBMs have historically struggled to scale effectively. Recent\nwork on Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) demonstrates the scalability of EBMs\nto high-dimensional spaces, but their potential for solving core challenges in\nphysically embodied models remains underexplored. We introduce a new\nenergy-based architecture, EBT-Policy, that solves core issues in robotic and\nreal-world settings. Across simulated and real-world tasks, EBT-Policy\nconsistently outperforms diffusion-based policies, while requiring less\ntraining and inference computation. Remarkably, on some tasks it converges\nwithin just two inference steps, a 50x reduction compared to Diffusion Policy's\n100. Moreover, EBT-Policy exhibits emergent capabilities not seen in prior\nmodels, such as zero-shot recovery from failed action sequences using only\nbehavior cloning and without explicit retry training.

Unlike traditional images\nor videos, 3D point clouds present unique challenges for copyright enforcement,\nas they are especially vulnerable to a range of geometric and non-geometric\nattacks that can easily degrade or remove conventional watermark signals. In\nthis paper, we address these challenges by proposing a robust deep neural\nwatermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection and ownership\nverification.

The network is trained to\nreliably extract watermarks even after the data undergoes various attacks such\nas rotation, scaling, noise, cropping and signal distortions. We validated our\nmethod using the publicly available ModelNet40 dataset, demonstrating that deep\nlearning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD-based\ntechniques under challenging conditions.

The first tier involves a machine\nlearning based analysis of population density, land cover, and existing\ninfrastructure compared with known school locations. The first tier identifies\npotential gaps and \"mislabelled\" schools. In subsequent tiers,\nmedium-resolution satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) is investigated to pinpoint\nregions with a high likelihood of school presence, followed by the application\nof very high-resolution (VHR) imagery and deep learning models to generate\ndetailed candidate locations for schools within these prioritised areas. The\nmedium-resolution approach was later removed due to insignificant improvements.\nThe medium and VHR resolution models build upon global pre-trained steps to\nimprove generalisation. A key component of the proposed approach is an\ninteractive interface to allow human operators to iteratively review, validate,\nand refine the mapping results. Preliminary evaluations indicate that the\nmulti-tiered strategy provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for\neducational infrastructure mapping to support planning and resource allocation.",

However, current generative models have two major\nlimitations: Frist, image generation models output rasterized images lacking\nsemantic structure, making it impossible to access, edit, or rearrange\nindependent visual components in the images. Second, code-based generation\nmethods (TikZ or SVG), although providing element-level control, force users\ninto the cumbersome cycle of \"writing-compiling-reviewing\" and lack the\nintuitiveness of manipulation. Neither of these two approaches can well meet\nthe needs for efficiency, intuitiveness, and iterative modification in\nscientific creation. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisPainter, a multi-agent\nframework for scientific illustration built upon the model context protocol.\nVisPainter orchestrates three specialized modules-a Manager, a Designer, and a\nToolbox-to collaboratively produce diagrams compatible with standard vector\ngraphics software. This modular, role-based design allows each element to be\nexplicitly represented and manipulated, enabling true element-level control and\nany element can be added and modified later. To systematically evaluate the\nquality of scientific illustrations, we introduce VisBench, a benchmark with\nseven-dimensional evaluation metrics. It assesses high-information-density\nscientific illustrations from four aspects: content, layout, visual perception,\nand interaction cost. To this end, we conducted extensive ablation experiments\nto verify the rationality of our architecture and the reliability of our\nevaluation methods. Finally, we evaluated various vision-language models,\npresenting fair and credible model rankings along with detailed comparisons of\ntheir respective capabilities. Additionally, we isolated and quantified the\nimpacts of role division, step control,and description on the quality of\nillustrations.",

Traditional\nmethods often rely on handcrafted priors, while modern deep learning approaches\ntypically require extensive pre-training on large external datasets, limiting\ntheir adaptability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose DeblurSDI,\na zero-shot, self-supervised framework based on self-diffusion (SDI) that\nrequires no prior training. DeblurSDI formulates blind deconvolution as an\niterative reverse self-diffusion process that starts from pure noise and\nprogressively refines the solution. At each step, two randomly-initialized\nneural networks are optimized continuously to refine the sharp image and the\nblur kernel. The optimization is guided by an objective function combining data\nconsistency with a sparsity-promoting L1-norm for the kernel. A key innovation\nis our noise scheduling mechanism, which stabilizes the optimization and\nprovides remarkable robustness to variations in blur kernel size. These allow\nDeblurSDI to dynamically learn an instance-specific prior tailored to the input\nimage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeblurSDI consistently achieves\nsuperior performance, recovering sharp images and accurate kernels even in\nhighly degraded scenarios.",

Consequently,\nembeddings of both queries and their corresponding video-clip segments for\ndistinct events within the same video collapse together, while embeddings of\nsemantically similar queries and segments from different videos are driven\napart. This limits retrieval performance when videos contain multiple, diverse\nevents. This paper addresses the aforementioned problems, termed as semantic\ncollapse, in both the text and video embedding spaces. We first introduce Text\nCorrelation Preservation Learning, which preserves the semantic relationships\nencoded by the foundation model across text queries. To address collapse in\nvideo embeddings, we propose Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive\nalignment method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across\ntemporal scales. Subsequently, we introduce order-preserving token merging and\nadaptive CBVA to enhance alignment by producing video segments that are\ninternally coherent yet mutually distinctive.

            "summary": "The rapid evolution of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion\nmodels has made synthetic media increasingly realistic, raising societal\nconcerns around misinformation, identity fraud, and digital trust. Existing\ndeepfake detection methods either rely on deep learning, which suffers from\npoor generalization and vulnerability to distortions, or forensic analysis,\nwhich is interpretable but limited against new manipulation techniques. This\nstudy proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features, including noise\nresiduals, JPEG compression traces, and frequency-domain descriptors, with deep\nlearning representations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision\ntransformers (ViTs). Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF\nv2, DFDC), the proposed model consistently outperformed single-method baselines\nand demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art\nhybrid approaches, achieving F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77, respectively.\nRobustness tests demonstrated stable performance under compression (F1 = 0.87\nat QF = 50), adversarial perturbations (AUC = 0.84), and unseen manipulations\n(F1 = 0.79). Importantly, explainability analysis showed that Grad-CAM and\nforensic heatmaps overlapped with ground-truth manipulated regions in 82\npercent of cases, enhancing transparency and user trust. These findings confirm\nthat hybrid approaches provide a balanced solution, combining the adaptability\nof deep models with the interpretability of forensic cues, to develop resilient\nand trustworthy deepfake detection systems.",

We then embed the feature trees of the\ntwo modalities into hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures to\neffectively model their hierarchical structures. To align across the\nheterogeneous hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures, we formulate a KL\ndistance measure between distributions on heterogeneous manifolds, and learn an\nintermediate manifold for manifold alignment by minimizing the distance.

In this paper, we\nask the following important question: can we accurately reconstruct the visual\nscene using only a very small portion of the bit rate in existing coding\nmethods while not sacrificing the accuracy of vision analysis and performance\nof human interactions? Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new\napproach for ultra-low bitrate image description. However, they can only\nachieve a semantic-level approximation of the visual scene, which is far\ninsufficient for the purpose of visual communication and remote vision analysis\nand human interactions. To address this important issue, we propose to\nseamlessly integrate image generation with deep image compression, using joint\ntext and coding latent to guide the rectified flow models for precise\ngeneration of the visual scene. The semantic text description and coding latent\nare both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the same image\nreconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while\nusing much less bandwidth. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.",

This approach\njointly optimizes grounding accuracy and confidence reliability, fostering\nintrospective self-criticism. Extensive experiments on seven challenge\nbenchmarks show that HyperClick achieves state-of-the-art performance while\nproviding well-calibrated confidence. By enabling explicit confidence\ncalibration and introspective self-criticism, HyperClick reduces overconfidence\nand supports more reliable GUI automation.",

Using the DFC2023 Track 2 dataset -- which includes over 125,000\nannotated buildings across 12 cities -- we evaluate YOLOv11's performance using\nmetrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP).\nOur findings demonstrate that YOLOv11 achieves strong instance segmentation\nperformance with 60.4\\% mAP@50 and 38.3\\% mAP@50--95 while maintaining robust\nclassification accuracy across five predefined height tiers. The model excels\nin handling occlusions, complex building shapes, and class imbalance,\nparticularly for rare high-rise structures. Comparative analysis confirms that\nYOLOv11 outperforms earlier multitask frameworks in both detection accuracy and\ninference speed, making it well-suited for real-time, large-scale urban\nmapping.

However, the inherent heterogeneity of HSI data has\nlong posed a major barrier to developing generalized models via joint training.\nAlthough HSI foundation models have shown promise for different downstream\ntasks, the existing approaches typically overlook the critical guiding role of\nsensor meta-attributes, and struggle with multi-sensor training, limiting their\ntransferability. To address these challenges, we propose SpecAware, which is a\nnovel hyperspectral spectral-content aware foundation model for unifying\nmulti-sensor learning for HSI mapping. We also constructed the Hyper-400K\ndataset to facilitate this research, which is a new large-scale, high-quality\nbenchmark dataset with over 400k image patches from diverse airborne AVIRIS\nsensors. The core of SpecAware is a two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding\nprocess for HSI data. Firstly, we designed a meta-content aware module to\ngenerate a unique conditional input for each HSI patch, tailored to each\nspectral band of every sample by fusing the sensor meta-attributes and its own\nimage content. Secondly, we designed the HyperEmbedding module, where a\nsample-conditioned hypernetwork dynamically generates a pair of matrix factors\nfor channel-wise encoding, consisting of adaptive spatial pattern extraction\nand latent semantic feature re-projection. Thus, SpecAware gains the ability to\nperceive and interpret spatial-spectral features across diverse scenes and\nsensors. This, in turn, allows SpecAware to adaptively process a variable\nnumber of spectral channels, establishing a unified framework for joint\npre-training. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that SpecAware\ncan learn superior feature representations, excelling in land-cover semantic\nsegmentation classification, change detection, and scene classification.",

Results from fundamental\nexperiments indicate that increasing the internal pressure results in a\nproportional increase in the effective coefficient of friction. This enables\nthe gripper to stably lift heavy and slippery objects without increasing the\ngripping force and to handle fragile or deformable objects, such as eggs,\nfruits, and paper cups, with minimal damage by increasing friction rather than\napplying excessive force. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid\ngripper finger with adaptable friction provides a robust and safer alternative\nto relying solely on high normal forces, thereby enhancing the gripper\nflexibility in handling delicate, fragile, and diverse objects.",

While existing caching techniques can\naccelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed\nand fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational\noverhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel\nhierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model\narchitectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising\nprocess can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a\ndetail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold\nsystem, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure\nthe efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature\nsummarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity\nestimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that\nH2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining\nimage quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and\nqualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a\nrobust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality\ndilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of\nhigh-fidelity diffusion models.

Besides static images, more and more research attentions have\nbeen drawn to the generation of realistic videos. The video generation not only\nhas a higher requirement for the quality, but also brings a challenge in\nensuring the video continuity. Among all the video generation tasks,\nhuman-involved contents, such as human dancing, are even more difficult to\ngenerate due to the high degrees of freedom associated with human motions. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework, named as DANCER (Dance ANimation via\nCondition Enhancement and Rendering with Diffusion Model), for realistic\nsingle-person dance synthesis based on the most recent stable video diffusion\nmodel. As the video generation is generally guided by a reference image and a\nvideo sequence, we introduce two important modules into our framework to fully\nbenefit from the two inputs. More specifically, we design an Appearance\nEnhancement Module (AEM) to focus more on the details of the reference image\nduring the generation, and extend the motion guidance through a Pose Rendering\nModule (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains. To further improve\nthe generation capability of our model, we also collect a large amount of video\ndata from Internet, and generate a novel datasetTikTok-3K to enhance the model\ntraining. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been evaluated through\nextensive experiments on real-world datasets, where the performance of our\nmodel is superior to that of the state-of-the-art methods.

However, most existing camera-radar fusion methods are limited to\nsingle-frame inputs, capturing only a partial view of the scene. The incomplete\nscene information, compounded by image degradation and 4D radar sparsity,\nhinders overall detection performance. In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers\nricher spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust\nand effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and\nmitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction.\nConsequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object\ndetection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal\ndata from camera and 4D imaging radar. Our framework leverages intermediate\nfeatures from the baseline detector and employs the tracker to produce\nreference trajectories, improving computational efficiency and providing richer\ninformation for second-stage. In the second stage, we design a global-level\ninter-object feature aggregation module guided by radar information to align\nglobal features across candidate proposals and a local-level inter-grid feature\naggregation module that expands local features along the reference trajectories\nto enhance fine-grained object representation. The aggregated features are then\nprocessed by a trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning module to\nencode cross-frame interactions and enhance temporal representation.

Newly\ndetected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused,\nregion-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated.

Although promising, these approaches fail to effectively transfer\ninformation between views and do not further refine the spatial relationship\nfeature maps. This results in the model erroneously focusing on irrelevant edge\nnoise, thereby affecting localization performance. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM),\nwhich performs multiple iterations of interaction between the two views,\nenabling continuous exchange and learning of contextual information about the\nquery object from both perspectives. This facilitates a deeper understanding of\ncross-view relationships while suppressing the edge noise unrelated to the\nquery object.

            "summary": "We introduce HiT, a novel hierarchical neural field representation for 3D\nshapes that learns general hierarchies in a coarse-to-fine manner across\ndifferent shape categories in an unsupervised setting. Our key contribution is\na hierarchical transformer (HiT), where each level learns parent-child\nrelationships of the tree hierarchy using a compressed codebook. This codebook\nenables the network to automatically identify common substructures across\npotentially diverse shape categories. Unlike previous works that constrain the\ntask to a fixed hierarchical structure (e.g., binary), we impose no such\nrestriction, except for limiting the total number of nodes at each tree level.\nThis flexibility allows our method to infer the hierarchical structure directly\nfrom data, over multiple shape categories, and representing more general and\ncomplex hierarchies than prior approaches. When trained at scale with a\nreconstruction loss, our model captures meaningful containment relationships\nbetween parent and child nodes. We demonstrate its effectiveness through an\nunsupervised shape segmentation task over all 55 ShapeNet categories, where our\nmethod successfully segments shapes into multiple levels of granularity.",
