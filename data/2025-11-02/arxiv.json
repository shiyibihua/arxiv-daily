      "summary": "Non-contact electrocardiogram (ECG) reconstruction from radar signals offers\na promising approach for unobtrusive cardiac monitoring. We present LifWavNet,\na lifting wavelet network based on a multi-resolution analysis and synthesis\n(MRAS) model for radar-to-ECG reconstruction. Unlike prior models that use\nfixed wavelet approaches, LifWavNet employs learnable lifting wavelets with\nlifting and inverse lifting units to adaptively capture radar signal features\nand synthesize physiologically meaningful ECG waveforms. To improve\nreconstruction fidelity, we introduce a multi-resolution short-time Fourier\ntransform (STFT) loss, that enforces consistency with the ground-truth ECG in\nboth temporal and spectral domains. Evaluations on two public datasets\ndemonstrate that LifWavNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ECG\nreconstruction and downstream vital sign estimation (heart rate and heart rate\nvariability). Furthermore, intermediate feature visualization highlights the\ninterpretability of multi-resolution decomposition and synthesis in\nradar-to-ECG reconstruction. These results establish LifWavNet as a robust\nframework for radar-based non-contact ECG measurement."

      "summary": "Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) distills score-based generative\nmodels into efficient one-step generators, without requiring a one-to-one\ncorrespondence with the sampling trajectories of their teachers. However,\nlimited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex\ngenerative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video\ngeneration. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory\nusage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency.\nWhile prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential\nsolution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of\nmulti-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step\ncounterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step\ndistillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model\ncapacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution\nmatching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the\nSNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR\nlevels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training\nobjective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous\nmathematical derivations. We validate Phased DMD by distilling state-of-the-art\nimage and video generation models, including Qwen-Image (20B parameters) and\nWan2.2 (28B parameters). Experimental results demonstrate that Phased DMD\npreserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative\ncapabilities. We will release our code and models."

Using paired attenuation (ATTN) and DFI radiograph images of\neuthanized mouse lungs, we generated realistic synthetic tumors with irregular\nboundaries and intensity profiles consistent with physical lung contrast. A\nU-Net segmentation network was trained on small patches using either ATTN, DFI,\nor a combination of ATTN and DFI channels.Results show that the DFI-only model\nachieved a true-positive detection rate of 83.7 percent, compared with 51\npercent for ATTN-only, while maintaining comparable specificity (90.5 versus\n92.9 percent).

Conventional soft grippers, while compliant, are\nmostly constrained by a fixed global morphology, and prior shape-morphing\nefforts have been largely confined to localized deformations, failing to\nreplicate this biological dexterity. Inspired by this natural exemplar, we\nintroduce the paradigm of collaborative, whole-body proprioceptive morphing,\nrealized in a modular soft gripper architecture. Our design is a distributed\nnetwork of modular self-sensing pneumatic actuators that enables the gripper to\nintelligently reconfigure its entire topology, achieving multiple morphing\nstates that are controllable to form diverse polygonal shapes. By integrating\nrich proprioceptive feedback from embedded sensors, our system can seamlessly\ntransition from a precise pinch to a large envelope grasp. We experimentally\ndemonstrate that this approach expands the grasping envelope and enhances\ngeneralization across diverse object geometries (standard and irregular) and\nscales (up to 10$\\times$), while also unlocking novel manipulation modalities\nsuch as multi-object and internal hook grasping.

Currently, the IoU-based similarity metric is the\nmost commonly preferred choice for detectors. However, detectors using IoU as a\nsimilarity metric often perform poorly when detecting small objects because of\ntheir sensitivity to minor positional deviations. To address this issue, recent\nstudies have proposed the Wasserstein Distance as an alternative to IoU for\nmeasuring the similarity of Gaussian-distributed bounding boxes. However, we\nhave observed that the Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance, which\nnegatively impacts the model's generalization capability. Additionally, when\nused as a loss function, its independent optimization of the center attributes\nleads to slow model convergence and unsatisfactory detection precision. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD).\nThrough analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD\nnot only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization,\nwhich enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the\nAI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box\nregression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across various detectors. We further validated the generalizability\nof GCD on the MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets, where it outperforms the\nWasserstein Distance across diverse scales of datasets.

Immutable\nheterogeneity poses a significant challenge in collaborative perception, as\nparticipating agents may employ different and fixed perception models. This\nleads to domain gaps in the intermediate features shared among agents,\nconsequently degrading collaborative performance. Aligning the features of all\nagents to a common representation can eliminate domain gaps with low training\ncost. However, in existing methods, the common representation is designated as\nthe representation of a specific agent, making it difficult for agents with\nsignificant domain discrepancies from this specific agent to achieve proper\nalignment. This paper proposes NegoCollab, a heterogeneous collaboration method\nbased on the negotiated common representation. It introduces a negotiator\nduring training to derive the common representation from the local\nrepresentations of each modality's agent, effectively reducing the inherent\ndomain gap with the various local representations. In NegoCollab, the mutual\ntransformation of features between the local representation space and the\ncommon representation space is achieved by a pair of sender and receiver. To\nbetter align local representations to the common representation containing\nmultimodal information, we introduce structural alignment loss and pragmatic\nalignment loss in addition to the distribution alignment loss to supervise the\ntraining.

A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when\napplied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize\nthat leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and\nbranching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To\ninvestigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating\nlarge-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in\nsegmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular\ngeometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,\nencouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate\nthat a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot\nsegmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains,\nrequiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model\nexhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in\nunseen domains without any target-specific training.

However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack\nsurface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a\nvisual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an\nattacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to\ninject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in\nthe environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit\nwide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant\nreliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that\nspans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger\nvariability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning\n(CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between\ntrigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision\nboundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent\nbenchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while\nmaintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to\nout-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL\nboosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data.\nThese findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based\nembodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world\ndeployment."

This\ndesign enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional\nmanner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the\ndecoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling\nmethod that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve\nasynchronously at different rates.

This\nprocess gives them their strength, yet it also opens the door to a hidden flaw.\nThe very gradients that help a model learn can also be used to produce small,\nimperceptible tweaks that cause the model to completely alter its decision.\nSuch tweaks are called adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit this\nvulnerability by adding tiny, imperceptible changes to images that, while\nleaving them identical to the human eye, cause the model to make wrong\npredictions. In this work, we propose Adversarially-trained Contrastive\nHard-mining for Optimized Robustness (ANCHOR), a framework that leverages the\npower of supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to\nenable the model to learn representations for images such that the embeddings\nfor the images, their augmentations, and their perturbed versions cluster\ntogether in the embedding space along with those for other images of the same\nclass while being separated from images of other classes. This alignment helps\nthe model focus on stable, meaningful patterns rather than fragile gradient\ncues. On CIFAR-10, our approach achieves impressive results for both clean and\nrobust accuracy under PGD-20 (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard\nadversarial training methods. Our results indicate that combining adversarial\nguidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more\nstructured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and\nrobustness."

To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP\nhashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced\ncodes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt\nencoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs.

First, we establish the Universal\nVideo Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to\nmeasure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks\nand domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable\nsynthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate\nthe semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality\nPyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by\nexplicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.\nExtensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot\ngeneralization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular\nbenchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant\nretrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario.

For time series, we introduce the annotated Siegfried Building Time\nSeries Dataset and, to reduce annotation costs, propose generating pseudo time\nseries from single-year maps by simulating common temporal transformations.\nExperimental results show that MapSAM2 learns temporal associations effectively\nand can accurately segment and link buildings in time series under limited\nsupervision or using pseudo videos.

In\nthis paper, we address these challenges by proposing a robust deep neural\nwatermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection and ownership\nverification.

Our experimental evaluation\ndemonstrates that the deep learning-based extraction approach significantly\noutperforms existing SVD-based methods with deep learning achieving bitwise\naccuracy up to 0.83 and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, compared to SVD\nachieving a bitwise accuracy of 0.58 and IoU of 0.26 for the Crop (70%) attack,\nwhich is the most severe geometric distortion in our experiment.

This\nstudy proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features, including noise\nresiduals, JPEG compression traces, and frequency-domain descriptors, with deep\nlearning representations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision\ntransformers (ViTs). Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF\nv2, DFDC), the proposed model consistently outperformed single-method baselines\nand demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art\nhybrid approaches, achieving F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77, respectively.\nRobustness tests demonstrated stable performance under compression (F1 = 0.87\nat QF = 50), adversarial perturbations (AUC = 0.84), and unseen manipulations\n(F1 = 0.79). Importantly, explainability analysis showed that Grad-CAM and\nforensic heatmaps overlapped with ground-truth manipulated regions in 82\npercent of cases, enhancing transparency and user trust.

The resulting two-stage\nexploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with\ntheoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then\nselecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video\nquestion-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements\nwhile processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20\nminutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating\nits effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and\ngeneral solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs."

To address this gap, we\nintroduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and\npresent a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game\nWerewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable\nground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark\nevaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap:\neven powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood\nreliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to\nground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly\nconservative in their alignment, highlighting the urgent need for novel\napproaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems."

The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) provides a\npowerful framework for planning under partial observability problems, capturing\nthe stochastic effects of actions and the limited information available through\nnoisy observations. POMDP solving could benefit tremendously from massive\nparallelization of today's hardware, but parallelizing POMDP solvers has been\nchallenging. They rely on interleaving numerical optimization over actions with\nthe estimation of their values, which creates dependencies and synchronization\nbottlenecks between parallel processes that can quickly offset the benefits of\nparallelization. In this paper, we propose Vectorized Online POMDP Planner\n(VOPP), a novel parallel online solver that leverages a recent POMDP\nformulation that analytically solves part of the optimization component,\nleaving only the estimation of expectations for numerical computation. VOPP\nrepresents all data structures related to planning as a collection of tensors\nand implements all planning steps as fully vectorized computations over this\nrepresentation. The result is a massively parallel solver with no dependencies\nand synchronization bottlenecks between parallel computations. Experimental\nresults indicate that VOPP is at least 20X more efficient in computing\nnear-optimal solutions compared to an existing state-of-the-art parallel online\nsolver."

To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel\nhierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model\narchitectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising\nprocess can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a\ndetail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold\nsystem, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure\nthe efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature\nsummarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity\nestimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that\nH2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining\nimage quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and\nqualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a\nrobust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality\ndilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of\nhigh-fidelity diffusion models.

Besides static images, more and more research attentions have\nbeen drawn to the generation of realistic videos. The video generation not only\nhas a higher requirement for the quality, but also brings a challenge in\nensuring the video continuity. Among all the video generation tasks,\nhuman-involved contents, such as human dancing, are even more difficult to\ngenerate due to the high degrees of freedom associated with human motions. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework, named as DANCER (Dance ANimation via\nCondition Enhancement and Rendering with Diffusion Model), for realistic\nsingle-person dance synthesis based on the most recent stable video diffusion\nmodel. As the video generation is generally guided by a reference image and a\nvideo sequence, we introduce two important modules into our framework to fully\nbenefit from the two inputs. More specifically, we design an Appearance\nEnhancement Module (AEM) to focus more on the details of the reference image\nduring the generation, and extend the motion guidance through a Pose Rendering\nModule (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains. To further improve\nthe generation capability of our model, we also collect a large amount of video\ndata from Internet, and generate a novel datasetTikTok-3K to enhance the model\ntraining. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been evaluated through\nextensive experiments on real-world datasets, where the performance of our\nmodel is superior to that of the state-of-the-art methods.

The incomplete\nscene information, compounded by image degradation and 4D radar sparsity,\nhinders overall detection performance. In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers\nricher spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust\nand effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and\nmitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction.\nConsequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object\ndetection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal\ndata from camera and 4D imaging radar. Our framework leverages intermediate\nfeatures from the baseline detector and employs the tracker to produce\nreference trajectories, improving computational efficiency and providing richer\ninformation for second-stage. In the second stage, we design a global-level\ninter-object feature aggregation module guided by radar information to align\nglobal features across candidate proposals and a local-level inter-grid feature\naggregation module that expands local features along the reference trajectories\nto enhance fine-grained object representation.

The\nLLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key\nobjects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly\ndetected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused,\nregion-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated.

However, this line of research is impeded by the absence of\na comprehensive and high-quality dataset, and collecting such a dataset over\nreal-world scenes is costly and technically infeasible. To this end, we have\nbuilt a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality synthetic dataset for SLAM\nin wildfire and forest environments. Leveraging the Unreal Engine 5 Electric\nDreams Environment Sample Project, we developed a pipeline to easily collect\naerial and ground views, including ground-truth camera poses and a range of\nadditional data modalities from unmanned aerial vehicle. Our pipeline also\nprovides flexible controls on environmental factors such as light, weather, and\ntypes and conditions of wildfire, supporting the need for various tasks\ncovering forest mapping, wildfire emergency response, and beyond. The resulting\npilot dataset, WildfireX-SLAM, contains 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images\nfrom a large-scale forest map with a total size of 16 km2. On top of\nWildfireX-SLAM, a thorough benchmark is also conducted, which not only reveals\nthe unique challenges of 3DGS-based SLAM in the forest but also highlights\npotential improvements for future works. The dataset and code will be publicly\navailable. Project page: https://zhicongsun.github.io/wildfirexslam."

      "summary": "Recent advances in neural decoding have enabled the reconstruction of visual\nexperiences from brain activity, positioning fMRI-to-image reconstruction as a\npromising bridge between neuroscience and computer vision. However, current\nmethods predominantly rely on subject-specific models or require\nsubject-specific fine-tuning, limiting their scalability and real-world\napplicability. In this work, we introduce ZEBRA, the first zero-shot brain\nvisual decoding framework that eliminates the need for subject-specific\nadaptation. ZEBRA is built on the key insight that fMRI representations can be\ndecomposed into subject-related and semantic-related components. By leveraging\nadversarial training, our method explicitly disentangles these components to\nisolate subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations. This\ndisentanglement allows ZEBRA to generalize to unseen subjects without any\nadditional fMRI data or retraining. Extensive experiments show that ZEBRA\nsignificantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance\ncomparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics. Our work represents a\nscalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding. Code and model\nweights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/ZEBRA."

      "summary": "Behavior cloning methods for robot learning suffer from poor generalization\ndue to limited data support beyond expert demonstrations. Recent approaches\nleveraging video prediction models have shown promising results by learning\nrich spatiotemporal representations from large-scale datasets. However, these\nmodels learn action-agnostic dynamics that cannot distinguish between different\ncontrol inputs, limiting their utility for precise manipulation tasks and\nrequiring large pretraining datasets. We propose a Dynamics-Aligned Flow\nMatching Policy (DAP) that integrates dynamics prediction into policy learning.\nOur method introduces a novel architecture where policy and dynamics models\nprovide mutual corrective feedback during action generation, enabling\nself-correction and improved generalization. Empirical validation demonstrates\ngeneralization performance superior to baseline methods on real-world robotic\nmanipulation tasks, showing particular robustness in OOD scenarios including\nvisual distractions and lighting variations."

      "summary": "We introduce HiT, a novel hierarchical neural field representation for 3D\nshapes that learns general hierarchies in a coarse-to-fine manner across\ndifferent shape categories in an unsupervised setting. Our key contribution is\na hierarchical transformer (HiT), where each level learns parent-child\nrelationships of the tree hierarchy using a compressed codebook. This codebook\nenables the network to automatically identify common substructures across\npotentially diverse shape categories. Unlike previous works that constrain the\ntask to a fixed hierarchical structure (e.g., binary), we impose no such\nrestriction, except for limiting the total number of nodes at each tree level.\nThis flexibility allows our method to infer the hierarchical structure directly\nfrom data, over multiple shape categories, and representing more general and\ncomplex hierarchies than prior approaches. When trained at scale with a\nreconstruction loss, our model captures meaningful containment relationships\nbetween parent and child nodes. We demonstrate its effectiveness through an\nunsupervised shape segmentation task over all 55 ShapeNet categories, where our\nmethod successfully segments shapes into multiple levels of granularity."
