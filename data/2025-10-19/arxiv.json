      "summary": "Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive\nacross multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce\nOmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We\ncarefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation.\nFor model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for\nstrengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared\nomni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing\nrelative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii)\nConstrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in\nomni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that\ngenerates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that\nmodalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model,\nOmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal\nunderstanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while\nusing just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to\nQwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream\napplications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory."

BLIP3o-NEXT\nunifies text-to-image generation and image editing within a single\narchitecture, demonstrating strong image generation and image editing\ncapabilities. In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model,\nwe identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable\nperformance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales\nefficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of\nreinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image\ngeneration; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction\nfollowing and the consistency between generated and reference images can be\nsignificantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality\nand scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of\nmodel performance. Building upon these insights, BLIP3o-NEXT leverages an\nAutoregressive + Diffusion architecture in which an autoregressive model first\ngenerates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs, whose hidden\nstates are then used as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate\nhigh-fidelity images. This architecture integrates the reasoning strength and\ninstruction following of autoregressive models with the fine-detail rendering\nability of diffusion models, achieving a new level of coherence and realism.\nExtensive evaluations of various text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks\nshow that BLIP3o-NEXT achieves superior performance over existing models."

The traditional\ngraphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry,\nmaterial and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by\nthe multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and\nparameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based\nrelighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view\nOne-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new\ndiverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a\nhigh-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We\nleverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides\na rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets. The\ninput portrait is first embedded in the latent manifold of such a model through\nan encoder-based inversion process. Then a novel triplane-based reflectance\nnetwork trained on our lightstage data is used to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT\nimages to enable image-based relighting. Our reflectance network operates in\nthe latent space of the generative head model, crucially enabling a relatively\nsmall number of lightstage images to train the reflectance model. Combining the\ngenerated OLATs according to a given HDRI environment maps yields physically\naccurate environmental relighting results. Through quantitative and qualitative\nevaluations, we demonstrate that 3DPR outperforms previous methods,\nparticularly in preserving identity and in capturing lighting effects such as\nspecularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering.

Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches\nwith potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of\nspatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce\nneuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary\nVLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg)\nto impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL)\nformulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to\nexplore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically\nextracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them\nas first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel\nlearns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., \"cat\") and a spatial pseudo\ncategory (e.g., \"right of person\") simultaneously, enforcing relational\nconstraints (e.g., a \"cat\" pixel must lie to the right of a \"person\"). Finally,\nthese logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy\nlogic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally\nconsistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nterms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows\nclear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of\nonly introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters,\nvalidating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS."

QSilk combines (i) a per-sample micro clamp that gently\nlimits extreme values without washing out texture, and (ii) Adaptive Quantile\nClip (AQClip), which adapts the allowed value corridor per region. AQClip can\noperate in a proxy mode using local structure statistics or in an attention\nentropy guided mode (model confidence). Integrated into the CADE 2.5 rendering\npipeline, QSilk yields cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and\nultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead.

The Audio-Visual Monitoring\nmodule extracts welfare indicators from synchronized video, audio, and feeding\ndata. Analytics & Alerting produces daily summaries and real-time\nnotifications, while Real-Time Egg Counting uses an edge vision model to\nautomate production tracking. Forecasting models predict egg yield and feed\nconsumption up to 10 days in advance, and the Recommendation Module integrates\nforecasts with weather data to guide environmental and operational adjustments.\n  This is among the first systems to combine low-cost sensing, edge analytics,\nand prescriptive AI to continuously monitor flocks, predict production, and\noptimize performance. Field trials demonstrate 100% egg-count accuracy on\nRaspberry Pi 5, robust anomaly detection, and reliable short-term forecasting.\nPoultryFI bridges the gap between isolated pilot tools and scalable, farm-wide\nintelligence, empowering producers to proactively safeguard welfare and\nprofitability."

Segmentation with coarse\nannotations is difficult, in particular when the objective is to optimize the\nalignment of boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a regularization\nmethod for models with an encoder-decoder architecture with superpixel based\nupsampling. It encourages the segmented pixels in the decoded image to be\nSLIC-superpixels, which are based on pixel color and position, independent of\nthe segmentation annotation. The method is applied to FCN-16 fully\nconvolutional network architecture and evaluated on the SUIM, Cityscapes, and\nPanNuke data sets.

However, existing detection methods are primarily\ndesigned to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect\nthese implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent,\nrisk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable\ntrade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection\nand mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious\nintention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative\ncapabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we\nleverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a\nnoise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high\naccuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative\nguidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the\nprominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive\nnegative guidance for sexual mitigation.

This issue stems from the ill-posed optimization\nin 3DGS. During training, background and foreground Gaussians are blended via\nalpha-compositing and optimized solely against the input RGB images using a\nphotometric loss. As this process lacks an explicit constraint on surface\nopacity, the optimization may incorrectly assign transparency to opaque\nregions, resulting in view-inconsistent and falsely transparent. This issue is\ndifficult to detect in standard evaluation settings but becomes particularly\nevident in object-centric reconstructions under interactive viewing. Although\nother causes of view-inconsistency have been explored recently, false\ntransparency has not been explicitly identified. To the best of our knowledge,\nwe are the first to identify, characterize, and develop solutions for this\nartifact, an underreported artifact in 3DGS. Our strategy, NGS, encourages\nsurface Gaussians to adopt higher opacity by injecting opaque noise Gaussians\nin the object volume during training, requiring only minimal modifications to\nthe existing splatting process. To quantitatively evaluate false transparency\nin static renderings, we propose a transmittance-based metric that measures the\nseverity of this artifact. In addition, we introduce a customized, high-quality\nobject-centric scan dataset exhibiting pronounced transparency issues, and we\naugment popular existing datasets with complementary infill noise specifically\ndesigned to assess the robustness of 3D reconstruction methods to false\ntransparency.

For predictions of the risk of\nclinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context\ndirectly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall\nspecificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were\nreduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to\nthree prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single\nvisit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context\nfrom prior clinical data.

Across four state-of-the-art recognition\nmodels (ArcFace, CosFace, ElasticFace, PartialFC) and two benchmarks (RFW,\nCelebA), LFA consistently outperforms k-means and nearest-neighbor search in\nintra-group semantic coherence, while uncovering interpretable latent\ndirections aligned with demographic and contextual attributes. These results\nposition LFA as a practical method for representation auditing of face\nrecognition models, enabling practitioners to identify and interpret biased\nsubpopulations without predefined attribute annotations."

Recently, there has been a growing\nshift towards tighter integration of these components, known as Integrated\nPrediction and Planning (IPP), with the aim of enabling more informed and\nadaptive decision-making. However, it remains unclear to what extent this\nintegration actually improves planning performance. In this work, we\ninvestigate the role of prediction in IPP approaches, drawing on the widely\nadopted Val14 benchmark, which encompasses more common driving scenarios with\nrelatively low interaction complexity, and the interPlan benchmark, which\nincludes highly interactive and out-of-distribution driving situations. Our\nanalysis reveals that even access to perfect future predictions does not lead\nto better planning outcomes, indicating that current IPP methods often fail to\nfully exploit future behavior information. Instead, we focus on high-quality\nproposal generation, while using predictions primarily for collision checks. We\nfind that many imitation learning-based planners struggle to generate realistic\nand plausible proposals, performing worse than PDM - a simple lane-following\napproach. Motivated by this observation, we build on PDM with an enhanced\nproposal generation method, shifting the emphasis towards producing diverse but\nrealistic and high-quality proposals. This proposal-centric approach\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods, especially in out-of-distribution\nand highly interactive settings, where it sets new state-of-the-art results."

Recognizing these\nsubtle expressions is critical for applications in psychology, security, and\nbehavioral analysis. Although deep learning has enabled significant advances in\nmicro-expression recognition (MER), its effectiveness is limited by the\nscarcity of annotated ME datasets. This data limitation not only hinders\ngeneralization but also restricts the diversity of motion patterns captured\nduring training. Existing MER studies predominantly rely on simple spatial\naugmentations (e.g., flipping, rotation) and overlook temporal augmentation\nstrategies that can better exploit motion characteristics. To address this gap,\nthis paper proposes a phase-aware temporal augmentation method based on dynamic\nimage. Rather than encoding the entire expression as a single onset-to-offset\ndynamic image (DI), our approach decomposes each expression sequence into two\nmotion phases: onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset. A separate DI is generated for\neach phase, forming a Dual-phase DI augmentation strategy. These phase-specific\nrepresentations enrich motion diversity and introduce complementary temporal\ncues that are crucial for recognizing subtle facial transitions. Extensive\nexperiments on CASME-II and SAMM datasets using six deep architectures,\nincluding CNNs, Vision Transformer, and the lightweight LEARNet, demonstrate\nconsistent performance improvements in recognition accuracy, unweighted\nF1-score, and unweighted average recall, which are crucial for addressing class\nimbalance in MER.

To address this issue, we propose\nDPTrack, a prompt-based aerial tracker designed for nighttime scenarios by\nencoding the given object's attribute features into the directional kernel\nenriched with fine-grained cues to generate precise prompts.

Subsequently, an encoder condenses these\ntopology-aware features into the directional kernel, which serves as the core\nguidance signal that explicitly encapsulates the object's fine-grained\nattribute cues. Finally, a kernel-guided prompt module built on\nchannel-category correspondence attributes propagates the kernel across the\nfeatures of the search region to pinpoint the positions of target features and\nconvert them into precise prompts, integrating spatial gating for robust\nnighttime tracking.

To overcome this problem, this paper\npresents MAVR-Net, a multi-view learning-based MAV action recognition\nframework.

We\nintroduce PFGS, a pose-aware 3DGS framework that addresses the practical\nchallenge of reconstructing complete objects from multi-pose image captures.\nGiven images of an object in one main pose and several auxiliary poses, PFGS\niteratively fuses each auxiliary set into a unified 3DGS representation of the\nmain pose. Our pose-aware fusion strategy combines global and local\nregistration to merge views effectively and refine the 3DGS model. While recent\nadvances in 3D foundation models have improved registration robustness and\nefficiency, they remain limited by high memory demands and suboptimal accuracy.\nPFGS overcomes these challenges by incorporating them more intelligently into\nthe registration process: it leverages background features for per-pose camera\npose estimation and employs foundation models for cross-pose registration. This\ndesign captures the best of both approaches while resolving background\ninconsistency issues. Experimental results demonstrate that PFGS consistently\noutperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,\nproducing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models."

These methods have been shown to generally lead to\ninconsistent or suboptimal results, as they do not directly maximize\nsegmentation metrics. To address this issue, a novel consistent segmentation\nframework, RankSEG, has been proposed, which includes RankDice and RankIoU\nspecifically designed to optimize the Dice and IoU metrics, respectively.\nAlthough RankSEG almost guarantees improved performance, it suffers from two\nmajor drawbacks. First, it is its computational expense-RankDice has a\ncomplexity of O(d log d) with a substantial constant factor (where d represents\nthe number of pixels), while RankIoU exhibits even higher complexity O(d^2),\nthus limiting its practical application. For instance, in LiTS, prediction with\nRankSEG takes 16.33 seconds compared to just 0.01 seconds with the argmax rule.\nSecond, RankSEG is only applicable to overlapping segmentation settings, where\nmultiple classes can occupy the same pixel, which contrasts with standard\nbenchmarks that typically assume non-overlapping segmentation. In this paper,\nwe overcome these two drawbacks via a reciprocal moment approximation (RMA) of\nRankSEG with the following contributions: (i) we improve RankSEG using RMA,\nnamely RankSEG-RMA, reduces the complexity of both algorithms to O(d) while\nmaintaining comparable performance; (ii) inspired by RMA, we develop a\npixel-wise score function that allows efficient implementation for\nnon-overlapping segmentation settings."

When evaluated on the\nDC2 Simulated Sky Survey -- a highly realistic synthetic dataset designed to\nmimic LSST data -- NPE systematically outperforms the standard LSST pipeline in\nlight source detection, flux measurement, star/galaxy classification, and\ngalaxy shape measurement. Additionally, NPE provides well-calibrated posterior\napproximations. These promising results, obtained using simulated data,\nillustrate the potential of NPE in the absence of model misspecification.\nAlthough some degree of model misspecification is inevitable in the application\nof NPE to real LSST images, there are a variety of strategies to mitigate its\neffects."

Recent works have\nsought to reduce their model size through layer-wise structured pruning.\nHowever, they tend to ignore retaining the capabilities in the pruned part. In\nthis work, we re-examine structured pruning paradigms and uncover several key\nlimitations: 1) notable performance degradation due to direct layer removal, 2)\nincompetent linear weight layer aggregation, and 3) the lack of effective\npost-training recovery mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose\nCoMe, including a progressive layer pruning framework with a\nConcatenation-based Merging technology and a hierarchical distillation\npost-training process. Specifically, we introduce a channel sensitivity metric\nthat utilizes activation intensity and weight norms for fine-grained channel\nselection. Subsequently, we employ a concatenation-based layer merging method\nto fuse the most critical channels across adjacent layers, enabling progressive\nmodel size reduction. Finally, we propose a hierarchical distillation protocol\nthat leverages the correspondences between the original and pruned model layers\nestablished during pruning, thereby enabling efficient knowledge transfer.\nExperiments on seven benchmarks show that CoMe achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance; when pruning 30% of LLaMA-2-7b's parameters, the pruned model\nretains 83% of its original average accuracy.

While effective\nfor high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited\ntraining efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision\ntasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack\nof clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis\nconfirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and\nunderstanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent\ndiffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent\ndiffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages\nself-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature\nspace with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features,\nwhile a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for\nhigh-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this\nsemantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As\na result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step\nsampling, and improves generative quality.

However, current methods\nhave two main drawbacks: (i) recognizability is only partially captured through\nsoft margin constraints, resulting in weaker quality representation and lower\ndiscrimination, especially for low-quality or ambiguous faces; (ii) mutual\noverlapping gradients between feature direction and magnitude introduce\nundesirable interactions during optimization, causing instability and confusion\nin hypersphere planning, which may result in poor generalization, and entangled\nrepresentations where recognizability and identity are not cleanly separated.\nTo address these issues, we introduce a hard margin strategy - Quality Control\nFace (QCFace), which overcomes the mutual overlapping gradient problem and\nenables the clear decoupling of recognizability from identity representation.\nBased on this strategy, a novel hard-margin-based loss function employs a\nguidance factor for hypersphere planning, simultaneously optimizing for\nrecognition ability and explicit recognizability representation.

Therefore, developing efficient methods for\ndisaster response and management is a critical task for relief teams. One of\nthe most essential components of effective response is the rapid collection of\ninformation about affected areas, damages, and victims. More data translates\ninto better coordination, faster rescue operations, and ultimately, more lives\nsaved. However, in some disasters, such as earthquakes, the communication\ninfrastructure is often partially or completely destroyed, making it extremely\ndifficult for victims to send distress signals and for rescue teams to locate\nand assist them in time. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as\nvaluable tools in such scenarios. In particular, a fleet of UAVs can be\ndispatched from a mobile station to the affected area to facilitate data\ncollection and establish temporary communication networks. Nevertheless,\nreal-world deployment of UAVs faces several challenges, with adverse weather\nconditions--especially wind--being among the most significant. To address this,\nwe develop a novel mathematical framework to determine the optimal location of\na mobile UAV station while explicitly accounting for the heterogeneity of the\nUAVs and the effect of wind. In particular, we generalize the Sylvester problem\nto introduce the Sylvester-Fermat-Torricelli (SFT) problem, which captures\ncomplex factors such as wind influence, UAV heterogeneity, and back-and-forth\nmotion within a unified framework. The proposed framework enhances the\npracticality of UAV-based disaster response planning by accounting for\nreal-world factors such as wind and UAV heterogeneity.
