We introduce\nOmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We\ncarefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation.\nFor model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for\nstrengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared\nomni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing\nrelative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii)\nConstrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in\nomni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that\ngenerates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that\nmodalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model,\nOmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal\nunderstanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while\nusing just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to\nQwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T.

To address this, we introduce BiomedXPro, an evolutionary framework\nthat leverages a large language model as both a biomedical knowledge extractor\nand an adaptive optimizer to automatically generate a diverse ensemble of\ninterpretable, natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis. Experiments\non multiple biomedical benchmarks show that BiomedXPro consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods, particularly in data-scarce few-shot\nsettings. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a strong semantic alignment\nbetween the discovered prompts and statistically significant clinical features,\ngrounding the model's performance in verifiable concepts.

BLIP3o-NEXT\nunifies text-to-image generation and image editing within a single\narchitecture, demonstrating strong image generation and image editing\ncapabilities. In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model,\nwe identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable\nperformance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales\nefficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of\nreinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image\ngeneration; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction\nfollowing and the consistency between generated and reference images can be\nsignificantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality\nand scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of\nmodel performance. Building upon these insights, BLIP3o-NEXT leverages an\nAutoregressive + Diffusion architecture in which an autoregressive model first\ngenerates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs, whose hidden\nstates are then used as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate\nhigh-fidelity images.

The traditional\ngraphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry,\nmaterial and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by\nthe multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and\nparameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based\nrelighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view\nOne-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new\ndiverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a\nhigh-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We\nleverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides\na rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets. The\ninput portrait is first embedded in the latent manifold of such a model through\nan encoder-based inversion process. Then a novel triplane-based reflectance\nnetwork trained on our lightstage data is used to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT\nimages to enable image-based relighting. Our reflectance network operates in\nthe latent space of the generative head model, crucially enabling a relatively\nsmall number of lightstage images to train the reflectance model. Combining the\ngenerated OLATs according to a given HDRI environment maps yields physically\naccurate environmental relighting results. Through quantitative and qualitative\nevaluations, we demonstrate that 3DPR outperforms previous methods,\nparticularly in preserving identity and in capturing lighting effects such as\nspecularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering.

Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches\nwith potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of\nspatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce\nneuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary\nVLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg)\nto impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL)\nformulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to\nexplore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically\nextracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them\nas first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel\nlearns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., \"cat\") and a spatial pseudo\ncategory (e.g., \"right of person\") simultaneously, enforcing relational\nconstraints (e.g., a \"cat\" pixel must lie to the right of a \"person\"). Finally,\nthese logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy\nlogic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally\nconsistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nterms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows\nclear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of\nonly introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters,\nvalidating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.",

Although neural\nrepresentation-based methods have shown promise in light field image\ncompression, most approaches rely on direct coordinate-to-pixel mapping through\nimplicit neural representation (INR), often neglecting the explicit modeling of\nscene structure.

The Audio-Visual Monitoring\nmodule extracts welfare indicators from synchronized video, audio, and feeding\ndata. Analytics & Alerting produces daily summaries and real-time\nnotifications, while Real-Time Egg Counting uses an edge vision model to\nautomate production tracking. Forecasting models predict egg yield and feed\nconsumption up to 10 days in advance, and the Recommendation Module integrates\nforecasts with weather data to guide environmental and operational adjustments.\n  This is among the first systems to combine low-cost sensing, edge analytics,\nand prescriptive AI to continuously monitor flocks, predict production, and\noptimize performance. Field trials demonstrate 100% egg-count accuracy on\nRaspberry Pi 5, robust anomaly detection, and reliable short-term forecasting.\nPoultryFI bridges the gap between isolated pilot tools and scalable, farm-wide\nintelligence, empowering producers to proactively safeguard welfare and\nprofitability.",

Unlike explicit\nharmful prompts, these subtle cues, often disguised as seemingly benign terms,\ncan unexpectedly trigger sexual content due to underlying model biases, raising\nsignificant ethical concerns. However, existing detection methods are primarily\ndesigned to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect\nthese implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent,\nrisk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable\ntrade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection\nand mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious\nintention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative\ncapabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we\nleverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a\nnoise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high\naccuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative\nguidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the\nprominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive\nnegative guidance for sexual mitigation.

This issue stems from the ill-posed optimization\nin 3DGS. During training, background and foreground Gaussians are blended via\nalpha-compositing and optimized solely against the input RGB images using a\nphotometric loss. As this process lacks an explicit constraint on surface\nopacity, the optimization may incorrectly assign transparency to opaque\nregions, resulting in view-inconsistent and falsely transparent. This issue is\ndifficult to detect in standard evaluation settings but becomes particularly\nevident in object-centric reconstructions under interactive viewing. Although\nother causes of view-inconsistency have been explored recently, false\ntransparency has not been explicitly identified. To the best of our knowledge,\nwe are the first to identify, characterize, and develop solutions for this\nartifact, an underreported artifact in 3DGS. Our strategy, NGS, encourages\nsurface Gaussians to adopt higher opacity by injecting opaque noise Gaussians\nin the object volume during training, requiring only minimal modifications to\nthe existing splatting process. To quantitatively evaluate false transparency\nin static renderings, we propose a transmittance-based metric that measures the\nseverity of this artifact. In addition, we introduce a customized, high-quality\nobject-centric scan dataset exhibiting pronounced transparency issues, and we\naugment popular existing datasets with complementary infill noise specifically\ndesigned to assess the robustness of 3D reconstruction methods to false\ntransparency.

Despite this need, existing medical AI systems\ndisrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret\nimages but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation\nmodels synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to\ngaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal\ncapabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws\ninspiration from diagnostic workflows through the\nObservation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation\nlevel, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that\nreformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational\nobservation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning\nthat systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis\nlevel, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for\nthe simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a\nsingle architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical\nimage understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation\nquality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified\narchitecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance\nvisual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally\nseparate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements\nacross diverse medical vision-language tasks.

We are motivated by the future of autonomy where quadrupeds will\nautonomously perform complex tasks despite real-world unknown uncertainty, such\nas unknown payload and uneven terrains. The algorithm uses random Fourier\nfeatures to approximate the residual dynamics in reproducing kernel Hilbert\nspaces.

It has broad applications across various real-world\napplications, including remote sensing element interpretation, ecological\nenvironment monitoring, and urban/rural planning. However, domain adaptation in\nremote sensing poses significant challenges due to differences in data, such as\nvariations in ground sampling distance, imaging modes from various sensors,\ngeographical landscapes, and environmental conditions. In recent years, deep\nlearning has emerged as a powerful tool for feature representation and\ncross-domain knowledge transfer, leading to widespread adoption in remote\nsensing tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of significant\nadvancements in deep learning based domain adaptation for remote sensing. We\nfirst introduce the preliminary knowledge to clarify key concepts, mathematical\nnotations, and the taxonomy of methodologies. We then organize existing\nalgorithms from multiple perspectives, including task categorization, input\nmode, supervision paradigm, and algorithmic granularity, providing readers with\na structured understanding of the field. Next, we review widely used datasets\nand summarize the performance of state-of-the-art methods to provide an\noverview of current progress. We also identify open challenges and potential\ndirections to guide future research in domain adaptation for remote sensing.\nCompared to previous surveys, this work addresses a broader range of domain\nadaptation tasks in remote sensing, rather than concentrating on a few\nsubfields.

For predictions of the risk of\nclinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context\ndirectly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall\nspecificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were\nreduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to\nthree prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single\nvisit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context\nfrom prior clinical data.

Our findings show that information collected over time\nprovides relevant context to enhance the specificity of medical risk\nprediction.

Traditional optimization-based methods are often constrained\nby cumbersome manual rules, while deep generative models face challenges in\nproducing content with richness and diversity. Furthermore, approaches that\nutilize large language models frequently lack robustness and fail to accurately\ncapture complex spatial relationships. To address these challenges, this paper\npresents a novel vision-guided 3D layout generation system. We first construct\na high-quality asset library containing 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D scene\nlayouts. Subsequently, we employ an image generation model to expand prompt\nrepresentations into images, fine-tuning it to align with our asset library. We\nthen develop a robust image parsing module to recover the 3D layout of scenes\nbased on visual semantics and geometric information. Finally, we optimize the\nscene layout using scene graphs and overall visual semantics to ensure logical\ncoherence and alignment with the images. Extensive user testing demonstrates\nthat our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of\nlayout richness and quality.

The\ndataset is derived from 127 World War II-era archival video segments containing\nclapperboards that record structured production metadata such as date,\nlocation, and camera-operator identity. ClapperText includes 9,813 annotated\nframes and 94,573 word-level text instances, 67% of which are handwritten and\n1,566 are partially occluded. Each instance includes transcription, semantic\ncategory, text type, and occlusion status, with annotations available as\nrotated bounding boxes represented as 4-point polygons to support spatially\nprecise OCR applications. Recognizing clapperboard text poses significant\nchallenges, including motion blur, handwriting variation, exposure\nfluctuations, and cluttered backgrounds, mirroring broader challenges in\nhistorical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded,\nnon-standard forms. We provide both full-frame annotations and cropped word\nimages to support downstream tasks. Using a consistent per-video evaluation\nprotocol, we benchmark six representative recognition and seven detection\nmodels under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite the small training\nset (18 videos), fine-tuning leads to substantial performance gains,\nhighlighting ClapperText's suitability for few-shot learning scenarios.

Most of these\napproaches rely on point clouds as observation inputs and construct scene\nrepresentations through point clouds feature learning, which enables them to\nachieve remarkable accuracy. However, the existing literature lacks an in-depth\nexploration of vision-only solutions that have significant potential. In this\npaper, we propose a Vision-Only and single-view Diffusion Policy learning\nmethod (VO-DP) that leverages pretrained visual foundation models to achieve\neffective fusion of semantic and geometric features. We utilize intermediate\nfeatures from VGGT incorporating semantic features from DINOv2 and geometric\nfeatures from Alternating Attention blocks. Features are fused via\ncross-attention and spatially compressed with a CNN to form the input to the\npolicy head. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VO-DP not only outperforms\nthe vision-only baseline DP significantly but also exhibits distinct\nperformance trends against the point cloud-based method DP3: in simulation\ntasks, VO-DP achieves an average success rate of 64.6% on par with DP3 64.0%\nand far higher than DP 34.8%, while in real-world tasks, it reaches 87.9%,\noutperforming both DP3 67.5% and DP 11.2% by a notable margin.

            "summary": "Traditionally, prediction and planning in autonomous driving (AD) have been\ntreated as separate, sequential modules. Recently, there has been a growing\nshift towards tighter integration of these components, known as Integrated\nPrediction and Planning (IPP), with the aim of enabling more informed and\nadaptive decision-making. However, it remains unclear to what extent this\nintegration actually improves planning performance. In this work, we\ninvestigate the role of prediction in IPP approaches, drawing on the widely\nadopted Val14 benchmark, which encompasses more common driving scenarios with\nrelatively low interaction complexity, and the interPlan benchmark, which\nincludes highly interactive and out-of-distribution driving situations. Our\nanalysis reveals that even access to perfect future predictions does not lead\nto better planning outcomes, indicating that current IPP methods often fail to\nfully exploit future behavior information. Instead, we focus on high-quality\nproposal generation, while using predictions primarily for collision checks. We\nfind that many imitation learning-based planners struggle to generate realistic\nand plausible proposals, performing worse than PDM - a simple lane-following\napproach. Motivated by this observation, we build on PDM with an enhanced\nproposal generation method, shifting the emphasis towards producing diverse but\nrealistic and high-quality proposals. This proposal-centric approach\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods, especially in out-of-distribution\nand highly interactive settings, where it sets new state-of-the-art results.",

This data limitation not only hinders\ngeneralization but also restricts the diversity of motion patterns captured\nduring training. Existing MER studies predominantly rely on simple spatial\naugmentations (e.g., flipping, rotation) and overlook temporal augmentation\nstrategies that can better exploit motion characteristics.

We introduce VDRive, a novel pipeline for end-to-end autonomous driving\nthat explicitly models state-action mapping to address these challenges,\nenabling interpretable and robust decision making. By leveraging the\nadvancement of the state understanding of the Vision Language Action Model\n(VLA) with generative diffusion policy-based action head, our VDRive guides the\ndriving contextually and geometrically. Contextually, VLA predicts future\nobservations through token generation pre-training, where the observations are\nrepresented as discrete codes by a Conditional Vector Quantized Variational\nAutoencoder (CVQ-VAE). Geometrically, we perform reinforcement learning\nfine-tuning of the VLA to predict future trajectories and actions based on\ncurrent driving conditions. VLA supplies the current state tokens and predicted\nstate tokens for the action policy head to generate hierarchical actions and\ntrajectories. During policy training, a learned critic evaluates the actions\ngenerated by the policy and provides gradient-based feedback, forming an\nactor-critic framework that enables a reinforcement-based policy learning\npipeline. Experiments show that our VDRive achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and nuScenes open-loop\nplanning.",

To\naddress this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive\nframework built upon our core philosophy: \"Select Less, Reason More.\" Our core\ncontribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework,\nwhich transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence.

Extensive experiments on five demanding\nvideo reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our EARL-trained model achieves new\nstate-of-the-art among open-source Video LLMs, simultaneously learning an\neffective and high-purity visual evidence selection policy.

In this work, we introduce the\nPredictive-Corrective (PC) paradigm, a framework that decouples the modeling\ntask to fundamentally accelerate learning. Building upon this paradigm, we\npropose a novel network, termed PCMambaNet. PCMambaNet is composed of two\nsynergistic modules. First, the Predictive Prior Module (PPM) generates a\ncoarse approximation at low computational cost, thereby anchoring the search\nspace. Specifically, the PPM leverages anatomical knowledge-bilateral\nsymmetry-to predict a 'focus map' of diagnostically relevant asymmetric\nregions. Next, the Corrective Residual Network (CRN) learns to model the\nresidual error, focusing the network's full capacity on refining these\nchallenging regions and delineating precise pathological boundaries. Extensive\nexperiments on high-resolution brain MRI segmentation demonstrate that\nPCMambaNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while converging within only 1-5\nepochs-a performance unattainable by conventional end-to-end models. This\ndramatic acceleration highlights that by explicitly incorporating domain\nknowledge to simplify the learning objective, PCMambaNet effectively mitigates\ndata inefficiency and overfitting.",

However, most existing\nmethods assume the object is captured in a single, static pose, resulting in\nincomplete reconstructions that miss occluded or self-occluded regions. We\nintroduce PFGS, a pose-aware 3DGS framework that addresses the practical\nchallenge of reconstructing complete objects from multi-pose image captures.\nGiven images of an object in one main pose and several auxiliary poses, PFGS\niteratively fuses each auxiliary set into a unified 3DGS representation of the\nmain pose. Our pose-aware fusion strategy combines global and local\nregistration to merge views effectively and refine the 3DGS model. While recent\nadvances in 3D foundation models have improved registration robustness and\nefficiency, they remain limited by high memory demands and suboptimal accuracy.\nPFGS overcomes these challenges by incorporating them more intelligently into\nthe registration process: it leverages background features for per-pose camera\npose estimation and employs foundation models for cross-pose registration. This\ndesign captures the best of both approaches while resolving background\ninconsistency issues. Experimental results demonstrate that PFGS consistently\noutperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,\nproducing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models.",

Current methods resort\nto integrating depth prediction to recover the spatial information for object\nquery decoding, which necessitates explicit supervision from LiDAR points\nduring the training phase. However, the predicted depth quality is still\nunsatisfactory such as depth discontinuity of object boundaries and\nindistinction of small objects, which are mainly caused by the sparse\nsupervision of projected points and the use of high-level image features for\ndepth prediction. Besides, cross-view consistency and scale invariance are also\noverlooked in previous methods. In this paper, we introduce Frequency-aware\nPositional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) to equip 2D image features with spatial\ninformation for 3D detection transformer decoder, which can be obtained through\nthree main modules. Specifically, the Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder\n(FSPE) constructs a feature pyramid by combining high-frequency edge clues and\nlow-frequency semantics from different levels respectively. Then the Cross-view\nScale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) estimates the pixel-level depth\ndistribution with cross-view and efficient channel attention mechanism.\nFinally, the Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) combines the 2D image features and\n3D position embeddings to generate the 3D depth-aware features for query\ndecoding. Additionally, hybrid depth supervision is adopted for complementary\ndepth learning from both metric and distribution aspects.

While the popular Forward-Backward\nrepresentations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we\nempirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation\nerrors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning\nsometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal\nperformance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot\nRL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that\nsimultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and\nrepresentation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in\nzero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable\nin-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a\ntask-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and\nmultimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE\nemploys expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to\ncapture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics.

First, we introduce an open-source\ncustom-built simulator for multi-material cutting that models coupling,\nfracture, and cutting forces, and supports reinforcement learning, enabling\nefficient training and rapid prototyping.

In the literature, most existing methods estimate\npixel-wise class probabilities, then apply argmax or thresholding to obtain the\nfinal prediction. These methods have been shown to generally lead to\ninconsistent or suboptimal results, as they do not directly maximize\nsegmentation metrics. To address this issue, a novel consistent segmentation\nframework, RankSEG, has been proposed, which includes RankDice and RankIoU\nspecifically designed to optimize the Dice and IoU metrics, respectively.\nAlthough RankSEG almost guarantees improved performance, it suffers from two\nmajor drawbacks. First, it is its computational expense-RankDice has a\ncomplexity of O(d log d) with a substantial constant factor (where d represents\nthe number of pixels), while RankIoU exhibits even higher complexity O(d^2),\nthus limiting its practical application. For instance, in LiTS, prediction with\nRankSEG takes 16.33 seconds compared to just 0.01 seconds with the argmax rule.\nSecond, RankSEG is only applicable to overlapping segmentation settings, where\nmultiple classes can occupy the same pixel, which contrasts with standard\nbenchmarks that typically assume non-overlapping segmentation. In this paper,\nwe overcome these two drawbacks via a reciprocal moment approximation (RMA) of\nRankSEG with the following contributions: (i) we improve RankSEG using RMA,\nnamely RankSEG-RMA, reduces the complexity of both algorithms to O(d) while\nmaintaining comparable performance; (ii) inspired by RMA, we develop a\npixel-wise score function that allows efficient implementation for\nnon-overlapping segmentation settings.",

However, existing facial landmark detection datasets often define\ndifferent numbers of landmarks, and most mainstream methods can only be trained\non a single dataset.

To address this issue, we\npropose Proto-Former, a unified, adaptive, end-to-end facial landmark detection\nframework that explicitly enhances dataset-specific facial structural\nrepresentations (i.e., prototype). Proto-Former overcomes the limitations of\nsingle-dataset training by enabling joint training across multiple datasets\nwithin a unified architecture. Specifically, Proto-Former comprises two key\ncomponents: an Adaptive Prototype-Aware Encoder (APAE) that performs adaptive\nfeature extraction and learns prototype representations, and a Progressive\nPrototype-Aware Decoder (PPAD) that refines these prototypes to generate\nprompts that guide the model's attention to key facial regions. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a novel Prototype-Aware (PA) loss, which achieves optimal path\nfinding by constraining the selection weights of prototype experts. This loss\nfunction effectively resolves the problem of prototype expert addressing\ninstability during multi-dataset training, alleviates gradient conflicts, and\nenables the extraction of more accurate facial structure features.

While existing\nmethods implicitly model label relationships through distance-based similarity,\nlacking explicit geometric definitions for different relationship types. To\naddress these limitations, we propose the first hyperbolic classification\nframework for SPMLL that represents each label as a hyperbolic ball rather than\na point or vector, enabling rich inter-label relationship modeling through\ngeometric ball interactions. Our ball-based approach naturally captures\nmultiple relationship types simultaneously: inclusion for hierarchical\nstructures, overlap for co-occurrence patterns, and separation for semantic\nindependence. Further, we introduce two key component innovations: a\ntemperature-adaptive hyperbolic ball classifier and a physics-inspired\ndouble-well regularization that guides balls toward meaningful configurations.\nTo validate our approach, extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets\n(MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, CUB-200-2011) demonstrate competitive\nperformance with superior interpretability compared to existing methods.\nFurthermore, statistical analysis reveals strong correlation between learned\nembeddings and real-world co-occurrence patterns, establishing hyperbolic\ngeometry as a more robust paradigm for structured classification under\nincomplete supervision.",

Effectively using recognizability to enhance feature\nrepresentation remains challenging. In deep FR, the loss function plays a\ncrucial role in shaping how features are embedded. However, current methods\nhave two main drawbacks: (i) recognizability is only partially captured through\nsoft margin constraints, resulting in weaker quality representation and lower\ndiscrimination, especially for low-quality or ambiguous faces; (ii) mutual\noverlapping gradients between feature direction and magnitude introduce\nundesirable interactions during optimization, causing instability and confusion\nin hypersphere planning, which may result in poor generalization, and entangled\nrepresentations where recognizability and identity are not cleanly separated.\nTo address these issues, we introduce a hard margin strategy - Quality Control\nFace (QCFace), which overcomes the mutual overlapping gradient problem and\nenables the clear decoupling of recognizability from identity representation.\nBased on this strategy, a novel hard-margin-based loss function employs a\nguidance factor for hypersphere planning, simultaneously optimizing for\nrecognition ability and explicit recognizability representation. Extensive\nexperiments confirm that QCFace not only provides robust and quantifiable\nrecognizability encoding but also achieves state-of-the-art performance in both\nverification and identification benchmarks compared to existing\nrecognizability-based losses.",

Therefore, developing efficient methods for\ndisaster response and management is a critical task for relief teams. One of\nthe most essential components of effective response is the rapid collection of\ninformation about affected areas, damages, and victims. More data translates\ninto better coordination, faster rescue operations, and ultimately, more lives\nsaved. However, in some disasters, such as earthquakes, the communication\ninfrastructure is often partially or completely destroyed, making it extremely\ndifficult for victims to send distress signals and for rescue teams to locate\nand assist them in time. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as\nvaluable tools in such scenarios. In particular, a fleet of UAVs can be\ndispatched from a mobile station to the affected area to facilitate data\ncollection and establish temporary communication networks. Nevertheless,\nreal-world deployment of UAVs faces several challenges, with adverse weather\nconditions--especially wind--being among the most significant. To address this,\nwe develop a novel mathematical framework to determine the optimal location of\na mobile UAV station while explicitly accounting for the heterogeneity of the\nUAVs and the effect of wind. In particular, we generalize the Sylvester problem\nto introduce the Sylvester-Fermat-Torricelli (SFT) problem, which captures\ncomplex factors such as wind influence, UAV heterogeneity, and back-and-forth\nmotion within a unified framework. The proposed framework enhances the\npracticality of UAV-based disaster response planning by accounting for\nreal-world factors such as wind and UAV heterogeneity. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that it can reduce wasted operational time by up to 84%, making\npost-disaster missions significantly more efficient and effective.",

To maximize the\ncapabilities of these systems, robots need to aggressively fly through tightly\nconstrained environments, such as dense forests and structurally unsafe\nbuildings, while minimizing flight time and avoiding obstacles. Existing\nmethods geometrically over-approximate the vehicle and obstacles, leading to\nconservative maneuvers and increased flight times. We eliminate these\nrestrictions by proposing PolyFly, an optimal global planner which considers a\nnon-conservative representation for aerial transportation by modeling each\nphysical component of the environment, and the robot (quadrotor, cable and\npayload), as independent polytopes. We further increase the model accuracy by\nincorporating the attitude of the physical components by constructing\norientation-aware polytopes. The resulting optimal control problem is\nefficiently solved by converting the polytope constraints into smooth\ndifferentiable constraints via duality theory. We compare our method against\nthe existing state-of-the-art approach in eight maze-like environments and show\nthat PolyFly produces faster trajectories in each scenario. We also\nexperimentally validate our proposed approach on a real quadrotor with a\nsuspended payload, demonstrating the practical reliability and accuracy of our\nmethod.",

While prior sensor fusion-based SLAM approaches have integrated\nvarious sensor modalities to improve their robustness, these algorithms are\nstill susceptible to estimation drift in challenging environments due to their\nreliance on unsuitable fusion strategies. Therefore, we propose a robust\nLiDAR-visual-inertial-kinematic odometry system that integrates information\nfrom multiple sensors, such as a camera, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit\n(IMU), and joint encoders, for visual and LiDAR-based odometry estimation. Our\nsystem employs a fusion-based pose estimation approach that runs\noptimization-based visual-inertial-kinematic odometry (VIKO) and filter-based\nLiDAR-inertial-kinematic odometry (LIKO) based on measurement availability. In\nVIKO, we utilize the footpreintegration technique and robust LiDAR-visual depth\nconsistency using superpixel clusters in a sliding window optimization. In\nLIKO, we incorporate foot kinematics and employ a point-toplane residual in an\nerror-state iterative Kalman filter (ESIKF). Compared with other sensor\nfusion-based SLAM algorithms, our approach shows robust performance across\npublic and longterm datasets.",

However, collecting\nhigh-quality diagnostic data remains difficult due to the rarity of these\nconditions, resulting in imbalanced and low-quality datasets that hinder model\nperformance. Moreover, no public efforts have been made to integrate multiple\nsources of information, such as imaging and clinical data, further limiting the\nability of AI models to support and enhance clinical decision-making. To\novercome these challenges, we introduce the Congenital Anomaly Recognition with\nDiagnostic Images and Unified Medical records (CARDIUM) dataset, the first\npublicly available multimodal dataset consolidating fetal ultrasound and\nechocardiographic images along with maternal clinical records for prenatal CHD\ndetection. Furthermore, we propose a robust multimodal transformer architecture\nthat incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to fuse feature representations\nfrom image and tabular data, improving CHD detection by 11% and 50% over image\nand tabular single-modality approaches, respectively, and achieving an F1 score\nof 79.8 $\\pm$ 4.8% in the CARDIUM dataset.

To address this\ngap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study across diverse image\nfoundation models, datasets, and distance normalization schemes. First, our\nanalysis shows that Mahalanobis-based methods aren't universally reliable.\nSecond, we define the ideal geometry for data representations and demonstrate\nthat spectral and intrinsic-dimensionality metrics can accurately predict a\nmodel's OOD performance. Finally, we analyze how normalization impacts OOD\nperformance. Building upon these studies, we propose radially scaled $\\ell_2$\nnormalization, a method that generalizes the standard $\\ell_2$ normalization\nrecently applied to Mahalanobis-based OOD detection. Our approach introduces a\ntunable parameter to directly control the radial geometry of the feature space,\nsystematically contracting or expanding representations to significantly\nimprove OOD detection performance.
