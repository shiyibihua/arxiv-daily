            "summary": "Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent\nvideos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond\nrealistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual\nperception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still\nremains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging\nvisual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to\ncomprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular\nVeo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including\nspatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically\ncharacterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,\nwe curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables\nin-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our\nfindings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning\npatterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and\nlocally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal\nreasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are\nnot yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging\nsigns as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.\nProject page: https://video-cof.github.io",

In this work, we advance\nthis technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically\nbased rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation.

Existing video-to-4D methods\ntypically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive\nand brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches\nmitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera\ntrajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby\ndepicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this\ntrajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene\ndynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a\npose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory\nprediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby\nseparating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video\ninpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising\nrealistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing\nregions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D\nannotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal\nautoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and\nextends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at\nbounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation\nand sparse reconstruction benchmarks.

Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework\nthat systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key\npillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a\nlarge-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that\nintegrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions\nfrom web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen\nmodels. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion\ntriplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose\nViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from\nMoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance\nefficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that\neliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong\ngeneralization.

In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion\nmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships\ndirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based\nhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into\nparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals.

We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction\napproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and\ndynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show\nthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,\nand produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the\nbaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes.

Accurate world models are essential for\nenabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic\nsettings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and\ndegrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation\nquality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or\nentangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask\nwhether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve\nworld-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly\naccurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing\na model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We\npropose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that\nconsecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent\nrepresentation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent\nrepresentations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.\nGRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales\nwith trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative\nbackbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,\nGRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that\nits benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric\nstructure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation\nlearning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering\nreliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.",

By incorporating a novel two-stage inference\nworkflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and\ncompare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on\nseveral recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,\nweaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These\nfindings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart\nunderstanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened\nin current models.",

HCP runs a short\nstochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, and then applies a one-step\nconsistency jump to produce the final action. To align this one-jump\ngeneration, HCP performs time-varying consistency distillation that combines a\ntrajectory-consistency objective to keep neighboring predictions coherent and a\ndenoising-matching objective to improve local fidelity.

Manual quality assessment\nis time-consuming and subjective, motivating the need for robust automated\nsolutions. In this work, we propose BRIQA (Balanced Reweighting in Image\nQuality Assessment), which addresses class imbalance in artifact severity\nlevels. BRIQA uses gradient-based loss reweighting to dynamically adjust\nper-class contributions and employs a rotating batching scheme to ensure\nconsistent exposure to underrepresented classes. Through experiments, no single\narchitecture performs best across all artifact types, emphasizing the\nimportance of architectural diversity. The rotating batching configuration\nimproves performance across metrics by promoting balanced learning when\ncombined with cross-entropy loss. BRIQA improves average macro F1 score from\n0.659 to 0.706, with notable gains in Noise (0.430), Zipper (0.098),\nPositioning (0.097), Contrast (0.217), Motion (0.022), and Banding (0.012)\nartifact severity classification.

LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains\nconstant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more\ndescriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to\nsuboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose\nthree heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the\nposterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated\ninto an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first\nexpose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using\nstochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic\nsupport adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic\ndeformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer\nlength and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the\nresulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy\nlearning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.",

While optical flow, a computer\nvision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,\nhas advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical\nproblems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical\nflow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,\nwhich limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based\napproaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in\ncomputer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We\npresent the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models\non RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and\nFl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer\naccuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the\nspatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the\nArctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing\nconsistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical\nflow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy\ncompared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote\nsensing.

Given a stream of asynchronous and\nspatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that\npreserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as\nvoxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames\nand voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches\ngives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show\nin our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate\nour tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and\nobject detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up\nto 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We\nachieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases\nwith absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for\nobject detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in\nevent-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the\nproperties of event cameras.",

It stands to\nreason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,\nstronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,\nwe present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow\nmatching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4\ndiverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results\nagainst 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,\ndemonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and\nperceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly\neffective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given\nlow-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that\nResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior\ndistribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,\nenabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can\nguide future users to reject uncertain predictions.",

We use FLYINGTRUST to compare\nrepresentative optimization-based and learning-based navigation approaches\nunder identical conditions, performing repeated trials per platform-scenario\ncombination and reporting uncertainty-aware metrics. The results reveal\nsystematic patterns: navigation success depends predictably on platform\ncapability and scene geometry, and different algorithms exhibit distinct\npreferences and failure modes across the evaluated conditions.

However,\ntheir generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain\nscenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to\nlarge distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation\nmechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or\nbespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across\ndiverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for\ncross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while\nrequiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to\ndecouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight\nmodules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual\nadapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a\nVisual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically\ninjected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone\nmodel. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without\nretraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on\nMedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA.

The traditional approach involves\nmanually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter\nversions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we\nintroduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization\ntechniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection\nproblem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video\nsummarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach\nemphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we\ndevelop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of\nvideo frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being\nselected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific\ndatasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of\n30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nacross various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,\nSpearman, and Kendall.",

However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,\nthe global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect\nthe high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine\nbones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,\nwhich deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network\n(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a\nscale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional\nlong-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the\nconsistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic\nlevel affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform\nsemantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a\nTransformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a\nfeature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method\nimproves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior\nsegmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,\nthe adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as\na promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal\nimage analysis.

Existing\napproaches, from vision-language-action (VLA) models to hierarchical\nframeworks, fall short due to their reliance on limited or dividual-agent\nmemory. This fundamentally constrains their ability to learn over long\nhorizons, scale to heterogeneous teams, or recover from failures, highlighting\nthe need for a unified memory representation. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable,\nand robust multi-robot collaboration. At the core of RoboOS-NeXT is the novel\nSpatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM), which integrates spatial scene\ngeometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared\nrepresentation. This memory-centric design is integrated into a\nbrain-cerebellum framework, where a high-level brain model performs global\nplanning by retrieving and updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute\nactions locally. This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution\nenables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent\nstate synchronization. We conduct extensive experiments spanning complex\ncoordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households. Our results\ndemonstrate that RoboOS-NeXT achieves superior performance across heterogeneous\nembodiments, validating its effectiveness in enabling lifelong, scalable, and\nrobust multi-robot collaboration.

Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability\nof pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous\nregions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.\nHowever, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can\nonly pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to\nidentify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment\nbetween image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving\nsub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose\nthe Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and\nfine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with\nautomatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel\nframework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,\nwhich consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and\nMulti-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics\ninto multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and\nconcatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and\nmulti-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align\nwith corresponding visual regions.

However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt\ncalibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on\nimproving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature\ndispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular\nseparation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular\nseparation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the\ncritical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel\nTPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the\ndistribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable\nprompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular\ndistance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach\nconsistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate\naverage calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through\nextensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,\nour approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural\ndistribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide\nextensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding\nof A-TPT.

In this article, we present the derivation of the theoretical\nfoundations for cooperative task spaces of multi-arm robotic systems based on\ngeometric primitives defined using conformal geometric algebra. Based on the\nsimilarity transformations of these cooperative geometric primitives, we derive\nan abstraction of complex robotic systems that enables representing these\nsystems in a way that directly corresponds to single-arm systems. By deriving\nthe associated analytic and geometric Jacobian matrices, we then show the\nstraightforward integration of our approach into classical control techniques\nrooted in operational space control. We demonstrate this using bimanual\nmanipulators, humanoids and multi-fingered hands in optimal control experiments\nfor reaching desired geometric primitives and in teleoperation experiments\nusing differential kinematics control. We then discuss how the geometric\nprimitives naturally embed nullspace structures into the controllers that can\nbe exploited for introducing secondary control objectives. This work,\nrepresents the theoretical foundations of this cooperative manipulation control\nframework, and thus the experiments are presented in an abstract way, while\ngiving pointers towards potential future applications.",

Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such\nas signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable\ninformation; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character\nrecognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image\nappears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion\n(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that\nare largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do\naddress text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,\noverlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,\nscene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in\npractical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for\nboth text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a\nvision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives\njointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by\nOCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and\nscene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these\ncomponents on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.\nAcross SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by\nup to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)\nwhile maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ.

To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early\ndetection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently\nestablished based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer\n(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of\nexisting methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One\npotential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of\nbackbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them\n(\\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global\nfeature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to\neffectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the\ntheory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm\ntransforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via\na set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the\naggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively\ntune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the\nperformance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly\navailable DR grading datasets.

We address this gap with a unified framework\nintegrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model.

            "summary": "Humanoids hold great potential for service, industrial, and rescue\napplications, in which robots must sustain whole-body stability while\nperforming intense, contact-rich interactions with the environment. However,\nenabling humanoids to generate human-like, adaptive responses under such\nconditions remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Thor, a\nhumanoid framework for human-level whole-body reactions in contact-rich\nenvironments. Based on the robot's force analysis, we design a force-adaptive\ntorso-tilt (FAT2) reward function to encourage humanoids to exhibit human-like\nresponses during force-interaction tasks. To mitigate the high-dimensional\nchallenges of humanoid control, Thor introduces a reinforcement learning\narchitecture that decouples the upper body, waist, and lower body. Each\ncomponent shares global observations of the whole body and jointly updates its\nparameters. Finally, we deploy Thor on the Unitree G1, and it substantially\noutperforms baselines in force-interaction tasks. Specifically, the robot\nachieves a peak pulling force of 167.7 N (approximately 48% of the G1's body\nweight) when moving backward and 145.5 N when moving forward, representing\nimprovements of 68.9% and 74.7%, respectively, compared with the\nbest-performing baseline. Moreover, Thor is capable of pulling a loaded rack\n(130 N) and opening a fire door with one hand (60 N). These results highlight\nThor's effectiveness in enhancing humanoid force-interaction capabilities.",

Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images\nby learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain\nlimited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection\nfurther affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex\nscenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion\nunder the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and\nvisible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the\nquantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,\nwhich leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational\nbottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and\ninformation decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal\ninformation, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural\ndetails. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion\nmodel is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical\nguidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at\ndifferent stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the\nintrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.\nExperimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nfusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple\ndatasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully\ndemonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing\ninspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and\ndetail quality.",

Building\non this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for\nestimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework\ncombines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch\nfeature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose\nestimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee\ngeometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses\nwhile preserving accurate self-contacts.

Another line of work adopts\nan explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all\nparts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to\ndegraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that\ncombines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding\nbox layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that\nimplicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little\ngeometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed\nfull-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,\neach part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,\nenabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a\ncenter-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when\nexchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby\nmaintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part\ndata, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to\ndate with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nFullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation.

Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall\nshort in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating\nperformance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the\nWaymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E).

To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail\nsituations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback\nScore (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between\npredicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted\ntrajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels.

Our research investigates how different\nlevels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse,\nextending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories\ninto a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view\nvideos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot),\nor high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we\ntriangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and\nuncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and\nqualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not\nlinear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in\neeriness and \"spine-tingling\" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,\nelicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and\nguilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots\ncompared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as\nanthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments\nof property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance\nproposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader\nsocietal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not\ndampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering\ncritical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.",

When these services end, the resulting harm raises\ncomplex questions of who bears responsibility when children's emotional bonds\nare broken. Using the Moxie shutdown as a case study through a qualitative\nsurvey of 72 U.S. participants, our findings show that the responsibility is\nviewed as a shared duty across the robot company, parents, developers, and\ngovernment. However, these attributions varied by political ideology and\nparental status of whether they have children. Participants' perceptions of\nwhether the robot service should continue are highly polarized; supporters\npropose technical, financial, and governmental pathways for continuity, while\nopponents cite business realities and risks of unhealthy emotional dependency.\nUltimately, this research contributes an empirically grounded shared\nresponsibility framework for safeguarding child-robot companionship by\ndetailing how accountability is distributed and contested, informing concrete\ndesign and policy implications to mitigate the emotional harm of robot\ndiscontinuation.",

By\nrepresenting the robot's physical topology as a graph, the proposed GNN-based\npolicy captures coupling among components, enabling faster and more stable\nlearning than conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) policies. The method is\nvalidated on a physical 3-bar tensegrity robot across three locomotion\nprimitives, including straight-line tracking and bidirectional turning. It\nshows superior sample efficiency, robustness to noise and stiffness variations,\nand improved trajectory accuracy. Notably, the learned policies transfer\ndirectly from simulation to hardware without fine-tuning, achieving stable\nreal-world locomotion. These results demonstrate the advantages of\nincorporating structural priors into reinforcement learning for tensegrity\nrobot control.",

Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound\n(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear\nas cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can\nprovide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly\ntrained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert\nannotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this\nchallenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)\nframework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an\nintra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of\nframes, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate\nvarious image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL\nand introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model\nperformance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation\nstrategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist\nand elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It\noutperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and\nconventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice\ncoefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential\nof FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well\nsuited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.",

This study investigates the\neffect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''\ncapabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language\ninference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,\nwe illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a\nmodel is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit\nfrom injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a\nmodel may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur\nacross different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention\npattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above\nfindings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of\ndebiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing\niterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights\nobtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.\nOur findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better\ndebiasing methods.",
