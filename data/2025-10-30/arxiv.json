      "summary": "Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent\nvideos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond\nrealistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual\nperception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still\nremains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging\nvisual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to\ncomprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular\nVeo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including\nspatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically\ncharacterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,\nwe curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables\nin-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our\nfindings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning\npatterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and\nlocally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal\nreasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are\nnot yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging\nsigns as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.\nProject page: https://video-cof.github.io"

      "summary": "There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation\nand 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a\npromising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce\nimmersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance\nthis technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically\nbased rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to\nrepurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,\nand PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize\nappearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we\npresent OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and\nefficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for\na broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,\ngeneration, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic\npanorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse\nindoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene\ngeneration, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic\nvirtual world generation."

Existing video-to-4D methods\ntypically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive\nand brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches\nmitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera\ntrajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby\ndepicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this\ntrajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene\ndynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a\npose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory\nprediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby\nseparating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video\ninpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising\nrealistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing\nregions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D\nannotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal\nautoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and\nextends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at\nbounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation\nand sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and\nqualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and\nimproved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,\nadvancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos."

Standard image retrieval techniques are\ninefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is\ninsufficient.

This paper introduces a\nhybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large\ngeographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification\ntask during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly\nencode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with\nembeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of\nground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas\nspanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our\napproach can localize within 200m more than 68\\% of queries of a dataset\ncovering a large part of Europe.

In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most\nnotably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization\nin modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can\nleverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework\nthat systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key\npillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a\nlarge-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that\nintegrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions\nfrom web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen\nmodels. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion\ntriplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose\nViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from\nMoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance\nefficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that\neliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong\ngeneralization.

Existing methods\nto model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic\nhierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability\nacross different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion\nmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships\ndirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based\nhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into\nparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy\ninference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent\nelemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies\nthrough graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction\napproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and\ndynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show\nthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,\nand produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the\nbaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,\ndata-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation\napplicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

      "summary": "A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.\nGiven past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the\nembodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for\nenabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic\nsettings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and\ndegrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation\nquality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or\nentangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask\nwhether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve\nworld-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly\naccurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing\na model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We\npropose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that\nconsecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent\nrepresentation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent\nrepresentations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.\nGRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales\nwith trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative\nbackbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,\nGRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that\nits benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric\nstructure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation\nlearning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering\nreliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module."

Manual quality assessment\nis time-consuming and subjective, motivating the need for robust automated\nsolutions. In this work, we propose BRIQA (Balanced Reweighting in Image\nQuality Assessment), which addresses class imbalance in artifact severity\nlevels. BRIQA uses gradient-based loss reweighting to dynamically adjust\nper-class contributions and employs a rotating batching scheme to ensure\nconsistent exposure to underrepresented classes. Through experiments, no single\narchitecture performs best across all artifact types, emphasizing the\nimportance of architectural diversity. The rotating batching configuration\nimproves performance across metrics by promoting balanced learning when\ncombined with cross-entropy loss. BRIQA improves average macro F1 score from\n0.659 to 0.706, with notable gains in Noise (0.430), Zipper (0.098),\nPositioning (0.097), Contrast (0.217), Motion (0.022), and Banding (0.012)\nartifact severity classification.

LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains\nconstant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more\ndescriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to\nsuboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose\nthree heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the\nposterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated\ninto an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first\nexpose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using\nstochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic\nsupport adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic\ndeformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer\nlength and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the\nresulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy\nlearning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance."

While optical flow, a computer\nvision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,\nhas advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical\nproblems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical\nflow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,\nwhich limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based\napproaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in\ncomputer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We\npresent the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models\non RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and\nFl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer\naccuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the\nspatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the\nArctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing\nconsistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical\nflow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy\ncompared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote\nsensing.

The traditional approach involves\nmanually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter\nversions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming.

To achieve this, we\ndevelop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of\nvideo frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being\nselected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific\ndatasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of\n30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns.

However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,\nthe global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect\nthe high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine\nbones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,\nwhich deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network\n(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a\nscale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional\nlong-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the\nconsistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic\nlevel affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform\nsemantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a\nTransformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a\nfeature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method\nimproves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior\nsegmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution\nenables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent\nstate synchronization.

Current TPT approaches primarily focus on\nimproving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature\ndispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular\nseparation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular\nseparation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the\ncritical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel\nTPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the\ndistribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable\nprompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular\ndistance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach\nconsistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate\naverage calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through\nextensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets.

With reinforcement learning agents and a curriculum learning\napproach, the trained agent may be a stepping stone towards application of\nreinforcement learning agents in automation of the forestry forwarder. The\nagent learnt grasping a log in a random position from grapple's random position\nand transport it to the bed with 94% success rate of the best performing agent."

Since these complex systems often have a very high number of\ndegrees of freedom coordinating their movements is notoriously difficult to\nmodel. In this article, we present the derivation of the theoretical\nfoundations for cooperative task spaces of multi-arm robotic systems based on\ngeometric primitives defined using conformal geometric algebra. Based on the\nsimilarity transformations of these cooperative geometric primitives, we derive\nan abstraction of complex robotic systems that enables representing these\nsystems in a way that directly corresponds to single-arm systems. By deriving\nthe associated analytic and geometric Jacobian matrices, we then show the\nstraightforward integration of our approach into classical control techniques\nrooted in operational space control. We demonstrate this using bimanual\nmanipulators, humanoids and multi-fingered hands in optimal control experiments\nfor reaching desired geometric primitives and in teleoperation experiments\nusing differential kinematics control. We then discuss how the geometric\nprimitives naturally embed nullspace structures into the controllers that can\nbe exploited for introducing secondary control objectives. This work,\nrepresents the theoretical foundations of this cooperative manipulation control\nframework, and thus the experiments are presented in an abstract way, while\ngiving pointers towards potential future applications."

Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such\nas signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable\ninformation; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character\nrecognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image\nappears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion\n(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that\nare largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do\naddress text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,\noverlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,\nscene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in\npractical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for\nboth text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a\nvision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives\njointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by\nOCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and\nscene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these\ncomponents on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.\nAcross SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by\nup to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)\nwhile maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ.

To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early\ndetection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently\nestablished based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer\n(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of\nexisting methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One\npotential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of\nbackbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them\n(\\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global\nfeature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to\neffectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the\ntheory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm\ntransforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via\na set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the\naggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively\ntune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the\nperformance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly\navailable DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our\nhybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the\nstate-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability\nfor feature fusion and decision-making."

To address this, we propose Thor, a\nhumanoid framework for human-level whole-body reactions in contact-rich\nenvironments. Based on the robot's force analysis, we design a force-adaptive\ntorso-tilt (FAT2) reward function to encourage humanoids to exhibit human-like\nresponses during force-interaction tasks. To mitigate the high-dimensional\nchallenges of humanoid control, Thor introduces a reinforcement learning\narchitecture that decouples the upper body, waist, and lower body. Each\ncomponent shares global observations of the whole body and jointly updates its\nparameters. Finally, we deploy Thor on the Unitree G1, and it substantially\noutperforms baselines in force-interaction tasks. Specifically, the robot\nachieves a peak pulling force of 167.7 N (approximately 48% of the G1's body\nweight) when moving backward and 145.5 N when moving forward, representing\nimprovements of 68.9% and 74.7%, respectively, compared with the\nbest-performing baseline.

Researchers have investigated various\nmethods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including\nblur kernels and optical flow.

In this paper, we\npropose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework\nusing Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion\nrepresentations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality\nfrom a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key\ncomponents: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale\nfeature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new\ntraining method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained\nmotion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a\nmotion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory.

      "summary": "Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture\nthe same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce\nEgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized\negocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural\nlanguage. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal\nVerification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but\nconsistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of\nexisting Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with\nresults far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively\nfinetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved\nconsistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For\nimprovements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework\nthat effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging\nconsistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its\nsuperiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view\nconsistency. All resources will be made publicly available."

      "summary": "Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion\nmodels, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial\ninputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations\nreveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing\ndiffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,\nespecially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)\ncontent. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted\nMulti-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the\ninput image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the\nprompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by\nsolely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods\nthat primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.\nConsequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal\ndiffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with\nfixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and\nstyle transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of\nPReMA."

Our research investigates how different\nlevels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse,\nextending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories\ninto a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view\nvideos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot),\nor high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we\ntriangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and\nuncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and\nqualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not\nlinear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in\neeriness and \"spine-tingling\" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,\nelicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and\nguilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots\ncompared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as\nanthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments\nof property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance\nproposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader\nsocietal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not\ndampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering\ncritical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks."

When these services end, the resulting harm raises\ncomplex questions of who bears responsibility when children's emotional bonds\nare broken. Using the Moxie shutdown as a case study through a qualitative\nsurvey of 72 U.S. participants, our findings show that the responsibility is\nviewed as a shared duty across the robot company, parents, developers, and\ngovernment. However, these attributions varied by political ideology and\nparental status of whether they have children. Participants' perceptions of\nwhether the robot service should continue are highly polarized; supporters\npropose technical, financial, and governmental pathways for continuity, while\nopponents cite business realities and risks of unhealthy emotional dependency.\nUltimately, this research contributes an empirically grounded shared\nresponsibility framework for safeguarding child-robot companionship by\ndetailing how accountability is distributed and contested, informing concrete\ndesign and policy implications to mitigate the emotional harm of robot\ndiscontinuation."

This paper introduces a\nmorphology-aware reinforcement learning framework that integrates a graph\nneural network (GNN) into the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. By\nrepresenting the robot's physical topology as a graph, the proposed GNN-based\npolicy captures coupling among components, enabling faster and more stable\nlearning than conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) policies. The method is\nvalidated on a physical 3-bar tensegrity robot across three locomotion\nprimitives, including straight-line tracking and bidirectional turning. It\nshows superior sample efficiency, robustness to noise and stiffness variations,\nand improved trajectory accuracy. Notably, the learned policies transfer\ndirectly from simulation to hardware without fine-tuning, achieving stable\nreal-world locomotion. These results demonstrate the advantages of\nincorporating structural priors into reinforcement learning for tensegrity\nrobot control."

      "summary": "Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric\npopulations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound\n(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear\nas cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can\nprovide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly\ntrained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert\nannotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this\nchallenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)\nframework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an\nintra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of\nframes, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate\nvarious image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL\nand introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model\nperformance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation\nstrategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist\nand elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It\noutperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and\nconventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice\ncoefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential\nof FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well\nsuited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce."

These limitations are particularly\napparent in real-life driving scenarios where state-of-the-art algorithms\nstruggle to safely or reliably complete overtaking manoeuvres. This is\nimportant, as reliable navigation around other vehicles is vital for safe\nautonomous wheel-to-wheel racing. The F1Tenth Competition provides a useful\nopportunity for developing wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms on a standardised\nphysical platform. The competition format makes it possible to evaluate\novertaking and wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms against the state-of-the-art.\nThis research presents a novel racing and overtaking agent capable of learning\nto reliably navigate a track and overtake opponents in both simulation and\nreality. The agent was deployed on an F1Tenth vehicle and competed against\nopponents running varying competitive algorithms in the real world. The results\ndemonstrate that the agent's training against opponents enables deliberate\novertaking behaviours with an overtaking rate of 87% compared 56% for an agent\ntrained just to race."

However, its effect on model's\nrobustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on\nout-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the\neffect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''\ncapabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language\ninference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,\nwe illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a\nmodel is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit\nfrom injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a\nmodel may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur\nacross different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention\npattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above\nfindings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of\ndebiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing\niterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights\nobtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.\nOur findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better\ndebiasing methods."
