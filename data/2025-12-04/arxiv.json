      "summary": "We show that deep neural networks trained across diverse tasks exhibit remarkably similar low-dimensional parametric subspaces. We provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that demonstrates that neural networks systematically converge to shared spectral subspaces regardless of initialization, task, or domain. Through mode-wise spectral analysis of over 1100 models - including 500 Mistral-7B LoRAs, 500 Vision Transformers, and 50 LLaMA-8B models - we identify universal subspaces capturing majority variance in just a few principal directions. By applying spectral decomposition techniques to the weight matrices of various architectures trained on a wide range of tasks and datasets, we identify sparse, joint subspaces that are consistently exploited, within shared architectures across diverse tasks and datasets. Our findings offer new insights into the intrinsic organization of information within deep networks and raise important questions about the possibility of discovering these universal subspaces without the need for extensive data and computational resources. Furthermore, this inherent structure has significant implications for model reusability, multi-task learning, model merging, and the development of training and inference-efficient algorithms, potentially reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale neural models."

      "summary": "Recent advances in illumination control extend image-based methods to video, yet still facing a trade-off between lighting fidelity and temporal consistency. Moving beyond relighting, a key step toward generative modeling of real-world scenes is the joint control of camera trajectory and illumination, since visual dynamics are inherently shaped by both geometry and lighting. To this end, we present Light-X, a video generation framework that enables controllable rendering from monocular videos with both viewpoint and illumination control. 1) We propose a disentangled design that decouples geometry and lighting signals: geometry and motion are captured via dynamic point clouds projected along user-defined camera trajectories, while illumination cues are provided by a relit frame consistently projected into the same geometry. These explicit, fine-grained cues enable effective disentanglement and guide high-quality illumination. 2) To address the lack of paired multi-view and multi-illumination videos, we introduce Light-Syn, a degradation-based pipeline with inverse-mapping that synthesizes training pairs from in-the-wild monocular footage. This strategy yields a dataset covering static, dynamic, and AI-generated scenes, ensuring robust training. Extensive experiments show that Light-X outperforms baseline methods in joint camera-illumination control and surpasses prior video relighting methods under both text- and background-conditioned settings."

In this work, we leverage the theory of optimal control and propose VGG-Flow, a gradient-matching-based method for finetuning pretrained flow matching models. The key idea behind this algorithm is that the optimal difference between the finetuned velocity field and the pretrained one should be matched with the gradient field of a value function. This method not only incorporates first-order information from the reward model but also benefits from heuristic initialization of the value function to enable fast adaptation. Empirically, we show on a popular text-to-image flow matching model, Stable Diffusion 3, that our method can finetune flow matching models under limited computational budgets while achieving effective and prior-preserving alignment."

      "summary": "Segmentation of magnetic resonance images (MRI) facilitates analysis of human brain development by delineating anatomical structures. However, in infants and young children, accurate segmentation is challenging due to development and imaging constraints. Pediatric brain MRI is notoriously difficult to acquire, with inconsistent availability of imaging modalities, substantial non-head anatomy in the field of view, and frequent motion artifacts. This has led to specialized segmentation models that are often limited to specific image types or narrow age groups, or that are fragile for more variable images such as those acquired clinically. We address this method fragmentation with BabySeg, a deep learning brain segmentation framework for infants and young children that supports diverse MRI protocols, including repeat scans and image types unavailable during training. Our approach builds on recent domain randomization techniques, which synthesize training images far beyond realistic bounds to promote dataset shift invariance. We also describe a mechanism that enables models to flexibly pool and interact features from any number of input scans. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance that matches or exceeds the accuracy of several existing methods for various age cohorts and input configurations using a single model, in a fraction of the runtime required by many existing tools."

      "summary": "Synthesizing high-fidelity frozen 3D scenes from monocular Mannequin-Challenge (MC) videos is a unique problem distinct from standard dynamic scene reconstruction. Instead of focusing on modeling motion, our goal is to create a frozen scene while strategically preserving subtle dynamics to enable user-controlled instant selection. To achieve this, we introduce a novel application of dynamic Gaussian splatting: the scene is modeled dynamically, which retains nearby temporal variation, and a static scene is rendered by fixing the model's time parameter. However, under this usage, monocular capture with sparse temporal supervision introduces artifacts like ghosting and blur for Gaussians that become unobserved or occluded at weakly supervised timestamps. We propose Splannequin, an architecture-agnostic regularization that detects two states of Gaussian primitives, hidden and defective, and applies temporal anchoring. Under predominantly forward camera motion, hidden states are anchored to their recent well-observed past states, while defective states are anchored to future states with stronger supervision. Our method integrates into existing dynamic Gaussian pipelines via simple loss terms, requires no architectural changes, and adds zero inference overhead. This results in markedly improved visual quality, enabling high-fidelity, user-selectable frozen-time renderings, validated by a 96% user preference.

However, existing approaches remain limited, either treating the model merely as a standalone generator or relying on abstract textual planning. To this end, we propose Draft-as-CoT (DraCo), a novel interleaved reasoning paradigm that fully leverages both textual and visual contents in CoT for better planning and verification. Our method first generates a low-resolution draft image as preview, providing more concrete and structural visual planning and guidance. Then, we employ the model's inherent understanding capability to verify potential semantic misalignments between the draft and input prompt, and performs refinement through selective corrections with super-resolution. In this way, our approach addresses two fundamental challenges: the coarse-grained nature of textual planning and the difficulty in generating rare attribute combinations. To support training, we curate DraCo-240K, aiming to enhance three atomic capabilities spanning general correction, instance manipulation, and layout reorganization. Supported by DraCo-CFG, a specialized classifier-free guidance (CFG) strategy for interleaved reasoning, DraCo achieves a tremendous increase on GenEval (+8%), Imagine-Bench (+0.91), and GenEval++ (+3%), significantly outperforming direct generation and other generation methods empowered by CoT."

We present ARM-Thinker, an A}gentic multimodal Reward Model that autonomously invokes external tools (e.g., image cropping, doc page retrieval) to ground judgments in verifiable evidence, replacing static, non-interactive reward scoring. This enables the model to verify fine-grained visual details, cross-reference multi-page evidence, and validate reasoning claims, which are capabilities absent in existing reward models. We train ARM-Thinker with multi-stage reinforcement learning, jointly optimizing tool-calling decisions and judgment accuracy. To evaluate agentic reward modeling, we introduce ARMBench-VL, comprising three benchmarks that assess fine-grained visual grounding (image-level tools), multi-page document understanding (retrieval tools), and instruction following (text-level verification). ARM-Thinker achieves +16.2% average improvement on reward modeling benchmarks, +9.6% on tool-use tasks, and outperforms baselines on multimodal math and logical reasoning benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that agentic capabilities significantly enhance both accuracy and interpretability of reward models."

Existing methods often treat long-horizon actions as linguistic sequences and apply trajectory-level optimization methods such as Trajectory-wise Preference Optimization (TPO) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), leading to coarse credit assignment and unstable training. However, unlike language, where a unified semantic meaning is preserved despite flexible sentence order, action trajectories progress through causally chained stages with different learning difficulties. This motivates progressive stage optimization. Thereby, we present Stage-Aware Reinforcement (STARE), a module that decomposes a long-horizon action trajectory into semantically meaningful stages and provides dense, interpretable, and stage-aligned reinforcement signals. Integrating STARE into TPO and PPO, we yield Stage-Aware TPO (STA-TPO) and Stage-Aware PPO (STA-PPO) for offline stage-wise preference and online intra-stage interaction, respectively. Further building on supervised fine-tuning as initialization, we propose the Imitation -> Preference -> Interaction (IPI), a serial fine-tuning pipeline for improving action accuracy in VLA models. Experiments on SimplerEnv and ManiSkill3 demonstrate substantial gains, achieving state-of-the-art success rates of 98.0 percent on SimplerEnv and 96.4 percent on ManiSkill3 tasks."

      "summary": "Long context reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated enhancement of their cognitive capabilities via chain-of-thought (CoT) inference. Training such models is usually done via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in reasoning based problems, like math and programming. However, RLVR is limited by several bottlenecks, such as, lack of dense reward, and inadequate sample efficiency. As a result, it requires significant compute resources in post-training phase. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose \\textbf{Semantic Soft Bootstrapping (SSB)}, a self-distillation technique, in which the same base language model plays the role of both teacher and student, but receives different semantic contexts about the correctness of its outcome at training time. The model is first prompted with a math problem and several rollouts are generated. From them, the correct and most common incorrect response are filtered, and then provided to the model in context to produce a more robust, step-by-step explanation with a verified final answer. This pipeline automatically curates a paired teacher-student training set from raw problem-answer data, without any human intervention. This generation process also produces a sequence of logits, which is what the student model tries to match in the training phase just from the bare question alone. In our experiment, Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We then tested its accuracy on MATH500, and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our experiments show a jump of 10.6%, and 10% improvements in accuracy, respectively, over group relative policy optimization (GRPO), which is a commonly used RLVR algorithm.

While effective for unconditional or text-to-image generation, corrupting phase components destroys spatial structure, making it ill-suited for tasks requiring geometric consistency, such as re-rendering, simulation enhancement, and image-to-image translation. We introduce Phase-Preserving Diffusion φ-PD, a model-agnostic reformulation of the diffusion process that preserves input phase while randomizing magnitude, enabling structure-aligned generation without architectural changes or additional parameters. We further propose Frequency-Selective Structured (FSS) noise, which provides continuous control over structural rigidity via a single frequency-cutoff parameter. φ-PD adds no inference-time cost and is compatible with any diffusion model for images or videos. Across photorealistic and stylized re-rendering, as well as sim-to-real enhancement for driving planners, φ-PD produces controllable, spatially aligned results. When applied to the CARLA simulator, φ-PD improves CARLA-to-Waymo planner performance by 50\\%. The method is complementary to existing conditioning approaches and broadly applicable to image-to-image and video-to-video generation.

However, most existing approaches typically lack explicit frequency modeling and rely on fixed or heuristic optimization schedules, which limit the generalization across heterogeneous degradation. To address these limitations, we propose EvoIR, an AiOIR-specific framework that introduces evolutionary frequency modulation for dynamic and adaptive image restoration. Specifically, EvoIR employs the Frequency-Modulated Module (FMM) that decomposes features into high- and low-frequency branches in an explicit manner and adaptively modulates them to enhance both structural fidelity and fine-grained details. Central to EvoIR, an Evolutionary Optimization Strategy (EOS) iteratively adjusts frequency-aware objectives through a population-based evolutionary process, dynamically balancing structural accuracy and perceptual fidelity. Its evolutionary guidance further mitigates gradient conflicts across degradation and accelerates convergence. By synergizing FMM and EOS, EvoIR yields greater improvements than using either component alone, underscoring their complementary roles. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that EvoIR outperforms state-of-the-art AiOIR methods."

In this paper, we introduce a new class of omni video-text models that integrate ideas from recent LM reasoning advances to address this challenge. More specifically, we present TV2TV, a unified generative modeling framework which decomposes video generation into an interleaved text and video generation process. TV2TV jointly learns language modeling (next-token prediction) and video flow matching (next-frame prediction) using a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. At inference time, TV2TV decides when to alternate between generating text and video frames, allowing the model to \"think in words\" about subsequent content before ``acting in pixels'' to produce frames. This design offloads much of the responsibility for deciding what should happen next to the language modeling tower, enabling improved visual quality and prompt alignment of generated videos. It also enables fine-grained controllability, allowing users to modify the video generation trajectory through text interventions at any point in the process. In controlled experiments on video game data, TV2TV demonstrates substantial improvements in both visual quality and controllability. TV2TV also scales to natural videos, as we show by augmenting sports videos with interleaved natural language action descriptions using vision-language models (VLMs). Training TV2TV on this corpus yields strong visual quality and prompt alignment, showcasing the model's ability to reason about and generate complex real-world action sequences. Together, these results highlight TV2TV as a promising step toward video generation with open-ended textual reasoning and control."

To realize this potential, a key research question remains open: how can a humanoid execute the human actions from generated videos in a zero-shot manner? This challenge arises because generated videos are often noisy and exhibit morphological distortions that make direct imitation difficult compared to real video. To address this, we introduce a two-stage pipeline. First, we lift video pixels into a 4D human representation and then retarget to the humanoid morphology. Second, we propose GenMimic-a physics-aware reinforcement learning policy conditioned on 3D keypoints, and trained with symmetry regularization and keypoint-weighted tracking rewards. As a result, GenMimic can mimic human actions from noisy, generated videos. We curate GenMimicBench, a synthetic human-motion dataset generated using two video generation models across a spectrum of actions and contexts, establishing a benchmark for assessing zero-shot generalization and policy robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate improvements over strong baselines in simulation and confirm coherent, physically stable motion tracking on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot without fine-tuning.

This article is a self-contained primer on diffusion over general state spaces, unifying continuous domains and discrete/categorical structures under one lens. We develop the discrete-time view (forward noising via Markov kernels and learned reverse dynamics) alongside its continuous-time limits -- stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ and continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) on finite alphabets -- and derive the associated Fokker--Planck and master equations. A common variational treatment yields the ELBO that underpins standard training losses. We make explicit how forward corruption choices -- Gaussian processes in continuous spaces and structured categorical transition kernels (uniform, masking/absorbing and more) in discrete spaces -- shape reverse dynamics and the ELBO. The presentation is layered for three audiences: newcomers seeking a self-contained intuitive introduction; diffusion practitioners wanting a global theoretical synthesis; and continuous-diffusion experts looking for an analogy-first path into discrete diffusion. The result is a unified roadmap to modern diffusion methodology across continuous domains and discrete sequences, highlighting a compact set of reusable proofs, identities, and core theoretical principles."

However, the reasoning processes of these models remain largely opaque; they typically output only final predictions without revealing the intermediate steps or fine-grained evidence (e.g., pixels, locations) that lead to the result. This contrasts with human intelligence, which naturally operates through a chain of visual reasoning. To address this limitation, we introduce the Visual Reasoning Tracer (VRT) task, which requires models to not only localize the target object but also explicitly predict the intermediate objects that form the reasoning path. To advance research in this area, we contribute: (1) VRT-Bench, a human-annotated benchmark for evaluating visual reasoning; (2) a new metric for assessing the quality of reasoning traces; and (3) VRT-80k, a large-scale dataset for reasoning model training. Our experiments reveal that while existing models often produce the correct final output, they struggle to ground their intermediate reasoning. In contrast, models trained on VRT-80k achieve substantial improvements in tracing the reasoning path."

We show that the boundaries of this manifold can be discovered in a fully self-supervised manner through Monte Carlo sampling, even when the governing equations of the system are unknown.\n  We provide theoretical guarantees, practical estimators of knowledge boundaries, and empirical validations across three domains: electromechanical railway point machines, electrochemical battery discharge curves, and physiological ECG signals.\n  Our results demonstrate that deterministic functional topology offers a unified mathematical foundation for perception, representation, and world-model construction, explaining why biological learners and self-supervised AI models can generalize from limited observations."

However, one typically sets them using heuristic approaches without formal near-optimality guarantees. Recent work by Gupta and Roughgarden studies how to learn a good step-size in gradient descent. However, like most of the literature with theoretical guarantees for gradient-based optimization, their results rely on strong assumptions on the function class including convexity and smoothness which do not hold in typical applications. In this work, we develop novel analytical tools for provably tuning hyperparameters in gradient-based algorithms that apply to non-convex and non-smooth functions. We obtain matching sample complexity bounds for learning the step-size in gradient descent shown for smooth, convex functions in prior work (up to logarithmic factors) but for a much broader class of functions. Our analysis applies to gradient descent on neural networks with commonly used activation functions (including ReLU, sigmoid and tanh). We extend our framework to tuning multiple hyperparameters, including tuning the learning rate schedule, simultaneously tuning momentum and step-size, and pre-training the initialization vector. Our approach can be used to bound the sample complexity for minimizing both the validation loss as well as the number of gradient descent iterations."

We find that naively applying StreamingLLM-style attention sinks to video diffusion leads to fidelity degradation and motion stagnation. To overcome this, we introduce Deep Forcing, which consists of two training-free mechanisms that address this without any fine-tuning. Specifically, 1) Deep Sink dedicates half of the sliding window to persistent sink tokens and re-aligns their temporal RoPE phase to the current timeline, stabilizing global context during long rollouts. 2) Participative Compression performs importance-aware KV cache pruning that preserves only tokens actively participating in recent attention while safely discarding redundant and degraded history, minimizing error accumulation under out-of-distribution length generation. Together, these components enable over 12x extrapolation (e.g. 5s-trained to 60s+ generation) with better imaging quality than LongLive, better aesthetic quality than RollingForcing, almost maintaining overall consistency, and substantial gains in dynamic degree, all while maintaining real-time generation. Our results demonstrate that training-free KV-cache management can match or exceed training-based approaches for autoregressively streaming long-video generation."

Second, contact information, which can be obtained from videos and physical interactions, provides sparse constraints on the boundary of the geometry. We combine the two sources of information through contact-guided 3D generation. The guidance formulation is inspired by drag-based editing in generative models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that our approach improves the reconstruction compared to pure 3D generation and contact-based optimization."

Our approach leverages multi-LLM collaboration guided by Chemistry-inspired interaction modeling, enabling ensembles that are effective (exploiting complementary strengths), stable (producing consistent quality), and calibrated (minimizing interference and error amplification). We evaluate our Chemistry-based Multi-LLM collaboration strategy on real-world clinical scenarios to investigate whether such interaction-aware ensembles can generate credible, patient-specific medication recommendations.

To address these limitations, we propose 4DLangVGGT, the first Transformer-based feed-forward unified framework for 4D language grounding, that jointly integrates geometric perception and language alignment within a single architecture. 4DLangVGGT has two key components: the 4D Visual Geometry Transformer, StreamVGGT, which captures spatio-temporal geometric representations of dynamic scenes; and the Semantic Bridging Decoder (SBD), which projects geometry-aware features into a language-aligned semantic space, thereby enhancing semantic interpretability while preserving structural fidelity. Unlike prior methods that depend on costly per-scene optimization, 4DLangVGGT can be jointly trained across multiple dynamic scenes and directly applied during inference, achieving both deployment efficiency and strong generalization. This design significantly improves the practicality of large-scale deployment and establishes a new paradigm for open-vocabulary 4D scene understanding. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D datasets demonstrate that our approach not only generalizes effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 2% gains under per-scene training and 1% improvements under multi-scene training.

We investigate four classical or quantum sequence models, including the Quantum Kernel-based Long Short-Term Memory (QK-LSTM), as learned optimizers in a \"learning to learn\" paradigm. Our numerical experiments on the Max-Cut problem demonstrate that the QK-LSTM optimizer achieves superior performance, obtaining the highest approximation ratios and exhibiting the fastest convergence rate across all tested problem sizes (n=10 to 13). Crucially, the QK-LSTM model achieves perfect parameter transferability by synthesizing a single, fixed set of near-optimal parameters, leading to a remarkable sustained acceleration of convergence even when generalizing to larger problems. This capability, enabled by the compact and expressive power of the quantum kernel architecture, underscores its effectiveness. The QK-LSTM, with only 43 trainable parameters, substantially outperforms the classical LSTM (56 parameters) and other quantum sequence models, establishing a robust pathway toward highly efficient parameter initialization for variational quantum algorithms in the NISQ era."

In this work, we propose the Quantum-inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Long Short-Term Memory (QKAN-LSTM), which integrates Data Re-Uploading Activation (DARUAN) modules into the gating structure of LSTMs. Each DARUAN acts as a quantum variational activation function (QVAF), enhancing frequency adaptability and enabling an exponentially enriched spectral representation without multi-qubit entanglement. The resulting architecture preserves quantum-level expressivity while remaining fully executable on classical hardware. Empirical evaluations on three datasets, Damped Simple Harmonic Motion, Bessel Function, and Urban Telecommunication, demonstrate that QKAN-LSTM achieves superior predictive accuracy and generalization with a 79% reduction in trainable parameters compared to classical LSTMs. We extend the framework to the Jiang-Huang-Chen-Goan Network (JHCG Net), which generalizes KAN to encoder-decoder structures, and then further use QKAN to realize the latent KAN, thereby creating a Hybrid QKAN (HQKAN) for hierarchical representation learning. The proposed HQKAN-LSTM thus provides a scalable and interpretable pathway toward quantum-inspired sequential modeling in real-world data environments."

In this paper we propose a novel architecture, which address these above challenges through semantic-guided hierarchical synthesis. Our approach starts with a method that organizes and synthesizes information based on meaning, followed by refining the texture. This process gives clear insights into the facial structure before we move on to creating detailed images. In the first stage, we blend two techniques: one that focuses on local features with CNNs and global features with Vision Transformers. This helped us create clear and detailed semantic layouts. In the second stage, we use a Multi-Modal Texture Generator to refine these layouts by pulling in information from different scales, ensuring everything looks cohesive and consistent. The architecture naturally handles arbitrary mask configurations through dynamic attention without maskspecific training. Experiment on two datasets CelebA-HQ and FFHQ shows that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, showing improvements in metrics like LPIPS, PSNR, and SSIM.

Among these techniques, Speculative Decoding accelerates inference by employing a fast but inaccurate draft model to autoregressively propose tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a more capable target model. However, due to unnecessary rejections caused by token mismatches in semantically equivalent steps, traditional token-level Speculative Decoding struggles in reasoning tasks. Although recent works have shifted to step-level semantic verification, which improve efficiency by accepting or rejecting entire reasoning steps, existing step-level methods still regenerate many rejected steps with little improvement, wasting valuable target compute. To address this challenge, we propose Arbitrage, a novel step-level speculative generation framework that routes generation dynamically based on the relative advantage between draft and target models. Instead of applying a fixed acceptance threshold, Arbitrage uses a lightweight router trained to predict when the target model is likely to produce a meaningfully better step. This routing approximates an ideal Arbitrage Oracle that always chooses the higher-quality step, achieving near-optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, Arbitrage consistently surpasses prior step-level Speculative Decoding baselines, reducing inference latency by up to $\\sim2\\times$ at matched accuracy."

To overcome these limitations we introduce RAMEN, a resolution-adjustable multimodal encoder that learns a shared visual representation across EO data in a fully sensor-agnostic manner. RAMEN treats the modality and spatial and temporal resolutions as key input data features, enabling coherent analysis across modalities within a unified latent space. Its main methodological contribution is to define spatial resolution as a controllable output parameter, giving users direct control over the desired level of detail at inference and allowing explicit trade-offs between spatial precision and computational cost. We train a single, unified transformer encoder reconstructing masked multimodal EO data drawn from diverse sources, ensuring generalization across sensors and resolutions. Once pretrained, RAMEN transfers effectively to both known and unseen sensor configurations and outperforms larger state-of-the-art models on the community-standard PANGAEA benchmark, containing various multi-sensor and multi-resolution downstream tasks.

It is now widely used for large-scale, ML-based systems in research, education, and consumer surveys. However, characterizing the discrepancy between simulators and ground truth remains challenging for increasingly complex, machine-learning-based systems. We propose a computationally tractable method to estimate the quantile function of the discrepancy between the simulated and ground-truth outcome distributions. Our approach focuses on output uncertainty and treats the simulator as a black box, imposing no modeling assumptions on its internals, and hence applies broadly across many parameter families, from Bernoulli and multinomial models to continuous, vector-valued settings. The resulting quantile curve supports confidence interval construction for unseen scenarios, risk-aware summaries of sim-to-real discrepancy (e.g., VaR/CVaR), and comparison of simulators' performance. We demonstrate our methodology in an application assessing LLM simulation fidelity on the WorldValueBench dataset spanning four LLMs."

Existing approaches, though partially address these issues, often struggle to generalize without massive synthetic data. To address these challenges, we propose HTR-ConvText, a model designed to capture fine-grained, stroke-level local features while preserving global contextual dependencies. In the feature extraction stage, we integrate a residual Convolutional Neural Network backbone with a MobileViT with Positional Encoding block. This enables the model to both capture structural patterns and learn subtle writing details. We then introduce the ConvText encoder, a hybrid architecture combining global context and local features within a hierarchical structure that reduces sequence length for improved efficiency. Additionally, an auxiliary module injects textual context to mitigate the weakness of Connectionist Temporal Classification. Evaluations on IAM, READ2016, LAM and HANDS-VNOnDB demonstrate that our approach achieves improved performance and better generalization compared to existing methods, especially in scenarios with limited training samples and high handwriting diversity."

Existing perceptual codecs primarily rely on pre-trained image generative priors to restore high-frequency details, but their frame-wise nature lacks temporal modeling and inevitably leads to perceptual flickering. To address this, GNVC-VD introduces a unified flow-matching latent refinement module that leverages a video diffusion transformer to jointly enhance intra- and inter-frame latents through sequence-level denoising, ensuring consistent spatio-temporal details. Instead of denoising from pure Gaussian noise as in video generation, GNVC-VD initializes refinement from decoded spatio-temporal latents and learns a correction term that adapts the diffusion prior to compression-induced degradation. A conditioning adaptor further injects compression-aware cues into intermediate DiT layers, enabling effective artifact removal while maintaining temporal coherence under extreme bitrate constraints. Extensive experiments show that GNVC-VD surpasses both traditional and learned codecs in perceptual quality and significantly reduces the flickering artifacts that persist in prior generative approaches, even below 0.01 bpp, highlighting the promise of integrating video-native generative priors into neural codecs for next-generation perceptual video compression."

This paper introduces the Temporal Data Kernel Perspective Space (TDKPS), which jointly embeds agents across time, and proposes several novel hypothesis tests for detecting behavioral change at the agent- and group-level in black-box multi-agent systems. We characterize the empirical properties of our proposed tests, including their sensitivity to key hyperparameters, in simulations motivated by a multi-agent system of evolving digital personas. Finally, we demonstrate via natural experiment that our proposed tests detect changes that correlate sensitively, specifically, and significantly with a real exogenous event.

A contact-implicit formulation is used to model distributed frictional interactions during sidewinding, and validated through MATLAB Simscape simulations and physical experiments on rigid ground and loose sand. To capture terrain deformation effects, Project Chrono's Soil Contact Model (SCM) is integrated with the articulated multibody dynamics, enabling prediction of slip, sinkage, and load redistribution that reduce stride efficiency on deformable substrates. For high-energy rolling locomotion on steep slopes, the Chrono DEM Engine is used to simulate particle-resolved granular interactions, revealing soil failure, intermittent lift-off, and energy dissipation mechanisms not captured by rigid models. Together, these methods span real-time control-oriented simulation and high-fidelity granular physics. Results demonstrate that rigid-ground models provide accurate short-horizon motion prediction, while continuum and particle-based terrain modeling becomes necessary for reliable mobility analysis in soft and highly dynamic environments. This work establishes a hierarchical simulation pipeline that advances robust, terrain-aware locomotion for robots operating in challenging unstructured settings."

However, previous training relies on a large amount of annotation data for supervision, and the labeling of depth maps is costly. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new self-supervised method for training depth completion networks. Our method simulates the depth deficits of transparent objects within non-transparent regions and utilizes the original depth map as ground truth for supervision. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to supervised approach, and pre-training with our method can improve the model performance when the training samples are small."

We systematically analyze existing reflection removal data sources for diversity, scalability, and photorealism. To address the shortage of suitable data, we construct a physically based rendering (PBR) pipeline in Blender, built around the Principled BSDF, to synthesize realistic glass materials and reflection effects. Efficient LoRA-based adaptation of the foundation model, combined with the proposed synthetic data, achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks.

However, its original implementation demands a considerable amount of memory, which restricts its deployment in resource-constrained environments such as embedded systems. To address this issue, we propose a GPU-oriented dynamic memory assignment strategy that optimizes the memory usage of the dilation operation.

These algorithms enable us to efficiently calculate a distance metric for neural architectures and to generate a set of hybrid offspring from two parent models. This facilitates the deployment of crossover-based search heuristics, allows us to perform a thorough analysis on the architectural loss landscape, and track population diversity during search. We highlight how our method vastly improves computational complexity over previous work and enables us to efficiently compute shortest paths between architectures. When instantiating the crossover in evolutionary searches, we achieve competitive results, outperforming competing methods.

Our framework encapsulates three core capabilities that successful LLM-agents will need: \\textbf{metacognition} (accurate self-assessment of skills), \\textbf{competitive awareness} (modeling rivals and market dynamics), and \\textbf{long-horizon strategic planning}. We illustrate our framework through a tractable simulated gig economy where agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) compete for jobs, develop skills, and adapt their strategies under competitive pressure. Our simulations illustrate how LLM agents explicitly prompted with reasoning capabilities learn to strategically self-improve and demonstrate superior adaptability to changing market conditions. At the market level, our simulations reproduce classic macroeconomic phenomena found in human labor markets, while controlled experiments reveal potential AI-driven economic trends, such as rapid monopolization and systemic price deflation. This work provides a foundation to further explore the economic properties of AI-driven labour markets, and a conceptual framework to study the strategic reasoning capabilities in agents competing in the emerging economy."

Despite substantial advances in diffusion model theory, the theoretical understanding of guided diffusion samplers remains severely limited. We make progress by developing a unified algorithmic and theoretical framework that accommodates both diffusion guidance and reward-guided diffusion. Aimed at fine-tuning diffusion models to improve certain rewards, we propose injecting a reward guidance term -- constructed from the difference between the original and reward-reweighted scores -- into the backward diffusion process, and rigorously quantify the resulting reward improvement over the unguided counterpart. As a key application, our framework shows that classifier-free guidance (CFG) decreases the expected reciprocal of the classifier probability, providing the first theoretical characterization of the specific performance metric that CFG improves for general target distributions. When applied to reward-guided diffusion, our framework yields a new sampler that is easy-to-train and requires no full diffusion trajectories during training. Numerical experiments further corroborate our theoretical findings."

We introduce a 1,024 prompt benchmark spanning four levels of linguistic complexity and evaluate demographic bias across multiple attributes in a systematic manner. Our analysis identifies system prompts, the predefined instructions guiding LVLMs, as a primary driver of biased behavior. Through decoded intermediate representations, token-probability diagnostics, and embedding-association analyses, we reveal how system prompts encode demographic priors that propagate into image synthesis. To this end, we propose FairPro, a training-free meta-prompting framework that enables LVLMs to self-audit and construct fairness-aware system prompts at test time. Experiments on two LVLM-based T2I models, SANA and Qwen-Image, show that FairPro substantially reduces demographic bias while preserving text-image alignment. We believe our findings provide deeper insight into the central role of system prompts in bias propagation and offer a practical, deployable approach for building more socially responsible T2I systems."

CDVAE comes with theoretical guarantees on valid latent adjustment and generalization bounds for ITE error. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that CDVAE outperforms baselines, and that state-of-the-art models greatly improve when augmented with its latent substitutes, approaching oracle performance without access to true adjustment variables.\n  The second contribution proposes an efficient framework for long-term counterfactual regression based on RNNs enhanced with Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) and InfoMax. It captures long-range dependencies under time-varying confounding while avoiding the computational cost of transformers, achieving state-of-the-art results and introducing CPC into causal inference.\n  The third contribution advances CRL by addressing how latent causes manifest in observed variables. We introduce a model-agnostic interpretability layer based on the geometry of the decoder Jacobian. A sparse self-expression prior induces modular, possibly overlapping groups of observed features aligned with shared latent influences. We provide recovery guarantees in both disjoint and overlapping settings and show that meaningful latent-to-observed structure can be recovered without anchor features or single-parent assumptions.

Conventional deep learning approaches require large annotated datasets, which are costly and often imbalanced across disease categories, limiting their reliability in practice. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses this challenge by enabling models to generalize from only a few labeled samples per class. In this study,we propose a balanced few-shot episodic learning framework tailored to the Retinal Fundus Multi-Disease Image Dataset (RFMiD). Focusing on the ten most represented classes, which still show substantial imbalance between majority diseases (e.g., Diabetic Retinopathy, Macular Hole) and minority ones (e.g., Optic Disc Edema, Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion), our method integrates three key components: (i) balanced episodic sampling, ensuring equal participation of all classes in each 5-way 5-shot episode; (ii) targeted augmentation, including Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and color/geometry transformations, to improve minority-class di- versity; and (iii) a ResNet-50 encoder pretrained on ImageNet, selected for its superior ability to capture fine-grained retinal features. Prototypes are computed in the embedding space and classification is performed with cosine similarity for improved stability. Trained on 100 episodes and evaluated on 1,000 test episodes, our framework achieves substantial accuracy gains and reduces bias toward majority classes, with notable improvements for underrepresented diseases.

By leveraging the growing availability of environmental sensing data, this treatise investigates pilot-free channel inference that estimates complete CSI directly from multimodal observations, including camera images, LiDAR point clouds, and GPS coordinates. In contrast to prior studies that rely on predefined channel models, we develop a data-driven framework that formulates the sensing-to-channel mapping as a cross-modal flow matching problem. The framework fuses multimodal features into a latent distribution within the channel domain, and learns a velocity field that continuously transforms the latent distribution toward the channel distribution. To make this formulation tractable and efficient, we reformulate the problem as an equivalent conditional flow matching objective and incorporate a modality alignment loss, while adopting low-latency inference mechanisms to enable real-time CSI estimation. In experiments, we build a procedural data generator based on Sionna and Blender to support realistic modeling of sensing scenes and wireless propagation. System-level evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over pilot- and sensing-based benchmarks in both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency for the downstream beamforming task."

Existing 2D approaches typically treat spatial axes independently, failing to decouple this false sequential proximity from true spatial distance. To restore the 2D spatial manifold, we introduce Geometric Positional Embedding (GeoPE), a framework that extends rotations to 3D Euclidean space using quaternions. To overcome non-commutativity and ensure symmetry, GeoPE constructs a unified rotational operator by computing the geometric mean in the Lie algebra. This creates a geometrically coupled encoding that effectively separates spatial dimensions.

Our Hybrid-Diffusion method learns to trigger such TAPs during inference. We validate the method on challenging real-world tasks: Vial Aspiration, Open-Container Liquid Transfer, and container unscrewing.

      "summary": "The main focus of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) is studying how large Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) can be more efficiently solved when addressed in a modular way, by combining partial solutions computed for smaller subtasks. Despite their very intuitive role for learning, most notions of MDP abstractions proposed in the HRL literature have limited expressive power or do not possess formal efficiency guarantees. This work addresses these fundamental issues by defining Realizable Abstractions, a new relation between generic low-level MDPs and their associated high-level decision processes. The notion we propose avoids non-Markovianity issues and has desirable near-optimality guarantees. Indeed, we show that any abstract policy for Realizable Abstractions can be translated into near-optimal policies for the low-level MDP, through a suitable composition of options. As demonstrated in the paper, these options can be expressed as solutions of specific constrained MDPs. Based on these findings, we propose RARL, a new HRL algorithm that returns compositional and near-optimal low-level policies, taking advantage of the Realizable Abstraction given in the input. We show that RARL is Probably Approximately Correct, it converges in a polynomial number of samples, and it is robust to inaccuracies in the abstraction."

To analysis whether LLMs can learn these features effectively and apply them to important nature language related tasks, we introduce a novel multilingual genre classification dataset derived from Project Gutenberg, a large-scale digital library offering free access to thousands of public domain literary works, comprising thousands of sentences per binary task (poetry vs. novel;drama vs. poetry;drama vs. novel) in six languages (English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese). We augment each with three explicit linguistic feature sets (syntactic tree structures, metaphor counts, and phonetic metrics) to evaluate their impact on classification performance. Experiments demonstrate that although LLM classifiers can learn latent linguistic structures either from raw text or from explicitly provided features, different features contribute unevenly across tasks, which underscores the importance of incorporating more complex linguistic signals during model training."

A critical observation of our study is the impact of the topology of the base distributions on the modelled posteriors. We find that standard unimodal base distributions fail to capture disconnected support, resulting in spurious probability bridges between modes. We demonstrate that initializing the flow with a Gaussian Mixture Model that matches the cardinality of the target modes significantly improves reconstruction fidelity, as measured by some distance and divergence metrics."

Our analysis reveals that only a small fraction of actions are critical in determining the final outcome. Building on this insight, we propose CARL, a critical-action-focused reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for multi-step agents. CARL achieves focused training through providing action-level optimization signals for high-criticality actions while excluding low-criticality actions from model update. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARL achieves both stronger performance and higher efficiency during training and inference across diverse evaluation settings."

To address this, we propose LiteVGGT, achieving up to 10x speedup and substantial memory reduction, enabling efficient processing of 1000-image scenes. We derive two key insights for 3D reconstruction: (1) tokens from local image regions have inherent geometric correlations, leading to high similarity and computational redundancy; (2) token similarity across adjacent network layers remains stable, allowing for reusable merge decisions. Guided by these, we design a simple yet efficient strategy, dubbed geometry-aware cached token merging. We analyze each token's geometric importance, optimizing anchor token selection to better preserve key information for reconstruction. We also cache and reuse merge indices across layers, substantially reducing latency with minimal accuracy impact. This strategy retains VGGT's core performance, enabling efficient fine-tuning and FP8 quantization for further gains.

They promise to contain a wealth of previously unseen Greek and Latin texts, but are extremely fragile and thus most cannot be unrolled physically. A solution to access these texts is virtual unrolling, where the papyrus surface is digitally traced out in a CT scan of the scroll, to create a flattened representation. This tracing is very laborious to do manually in gigavoxel-sized scans, so automated approaches are desirable. We present the first top-down method that automatically fits a surface model to a CT scan of a severely damaged scroll. We take a novel approach that globally fits an explicit parametric model of the deformed scroll to existing neural network predictions of where the rolled papyrus likely passes. Our method guarantees the resulting surface is a single continuous 2D sheet, even passing through regions where the surface is not detectable in the CT scan. We conduct comprehensive experiments on high-resolution CT scans of two scrolls, showing that our approach successfully unrolls large regions, and exceeds the performance of the only existing automated unrolling method suitable for this data."

This indicates the preceding semantics potentially benefit texture generation by providing a semantic anchor. Recent advances have integrated semantic priors from pretrained visual encoders to further enhance LDMs, yet they still denoise semantic and VAE-encoded texture synchronously, neglecting such ordering. Observing these, we propose Semantic-First Diffusion (SFD), a latent diffusion paradigm that explicitly prioritizes semantic formation. SFD first constructs composite latents by combining a compact semantic latent, which is extracted from a pretrained visual encoder via a dedicated Semantic VAE, with the texture latent. The core of SFD is to denoise the semantic and texture latents asynchronously using separate noise schedules: semantics precede textures by a temporal offset, providing clearer high-level guidance for texture refinement and enabling natural coarse-to-fine generation. On ImageNet 256x256 with guidance, SFD achieves FID 1.06 (LightningDiT-XL) and FID 1.04 (1.0B LightningDiT-XXL), while achieving up to 100x faster convergence than the original DiT. SFD also improves existing methods like ReDi and VA-VAE, demonstrating the effectiveness of asynchronous, semantics-led modeling. Project page and code: https://yuemingpan.github.io/SFD.github.io/."

We formulate the problem as a cooperative Markov game and propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework in which each operating room (OR) is an agent trained with centralized training and decentralized execution. All agents share a policy trained via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which maps rich system states to actions, while a within-epoch sequential assignment protocol constructs conflict-free joint schedules across ORs. A mixed-integer pre-schedule provides reference starting times for electives; we impose type-specific quadratic delay penalties relative to these references and a terminal overtime penalty, yielding a single reward that captures throughput, timeliness, and staff workload. In simulations reflecting a realistic hospital mix (six ORs, eight surgery types, random urgent and emergency arrivals), the learned policy outperforms six rule-based heuristics across seven metrics and three evaluation subsets, and, relative to an ex post MIP oracle, quantifies optimality gaps. Policy analytics reveal interpretable behavior-prioritizing emergencies, batching similar cases to reduce setups, and deferring lower-value electives. We also derive a suboptimality bound for the sequential decomposition under simplifying assumptions. We discuss limitations-including OR homogeneity and the omission of explicit staffing constraints-and outline extensions. Overall, the approach offers a practical, interpretable, and tunable data-driven complement to optimization for real-time OR scheduling."

Three planned reference trajectories are compared against a free-driving baseline (NOREF) to assess trade-offs between lap time (LT) and steering effort (SE): NOM, the nominal time-optimal trajectory; TLC, a track-limit-robust trajectory obtained by tightening margins to the track edges; and FLC, a friction-limit-robust trajectory obtained by tightening against axle and tire saturation. All trajectories share the same minimum lap-time objective with a small steering-smoothness regularizer and are evaluated by two professional drivers using a high-performance car on a virtual track. The trajectories derive from a disturbance-aware minimum-lap-time framework recently proposed by the authors, where worst-case disturbance growth is propagated over a finite horizon and used to tighten tire-friction and track-limit constraints, preserving performance while providing probabilistic safety margins. LT and SE are used as performance indicators, while RMS lateral deviation, speed error, and drift angle characterize driving style. Results show a Pareto-like LT-SE trade-off: NOM yields the shortest LT but highest SE; TLC minimizes SE at the cost of longer LT; FLC lies near the efficient frontier, substantially reducing SE relative to NOM with only a small LT increase. Removing trajectory guidance (NOREF) increases both LT and SE, confirming that reference trajectories improve pace and control efficiency. Overall, the findings highlight reference-based and disturbance-aware planning, especially FLC, as effective tools for training and for achieving fast yet stable trajectories."

Typically, the worst-case error of the best basis set decays only as fast as $Θ\\(n^{-1/d}\\)$, where $n$ is the number of basis functions and $d$ is the input dimension. However, there are many examples of high-dimensional pattern recognition problems (such as face recognition) where linear combinations of small sets of features do solve the problem well. Hence these function classes do not suffer from the ``curse of dimensionality'' associated with more general classes. It is natural then, to look for characterizations of high-dimensional function classes that nevertheless are approximated well by linear combinations of small sets of features. In this paper we give a general result relating the error of approximation of a function class to the covering number of its ``convex core''. For one-hidden-layer neural networks, covering numbers of the class of functions computed by a single hidden node upper bound the covering numbers of the convex core. Hence, using standard results we obtain upper bounds on the approximation rate of neural network classes."

Based on these insights, we propose ReflexFlow, a simple and effective reflexive refinement of the Flow Matching learning objective that dynamically corrects exposure bias. ReflexFlow consists of two components: (1) Anti-Drift Rectification (ADR), which reflexively adjusts prediction targets for biased inputs utilizing a redesigned loss under training-time scheduled sampling; and (2) Frequency Compensation (FC), which reflects on missing low-frequency components and compensates them by reweighting the loss using exposure bias. ReflexFlow is model-agnostic, compatible with all Flow Matching frameworks, and improves generation quality across datasets. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, and ImageNet-256 show that ReflexFlow outperforms prior approaches in mitigating exposure bias, achieving a 35.65% reduction in FID on CelebA-64."

      "summary": "Multimodal Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), have become integral to critical applications ranging from autonomous decision-making to automated document processing. As these systems scale, they rely heavily on preprocessing pipelines to handle diverse inputs efficiently. However, this dependency on standard preprocessing operations, specifically image downscaling, creates a significant yet often overlooked security vulnerability. While intended for computational optimization, scaling algorithms can be exploited to conceal malicious visual prompts that are invisible to human observers but become active semantic instructions once processed by the model. Current adversarial strategies remain largely static, failing to account for the dynamic nature of modern agentic workflows. To address this gap, we propose Chameleon, a novel, adaptive adversarial framework designed to expose and exploit scaling vulnerabilities in production VLMs. Unlike traditional static attacks, Chameleon employs an iterative, agent-based optimization mechanism that dynamically refines image perturbations based on the target model's real-time feedback. This allows the framework to craft highly robust adversarial examples that survive standard downscaling operations to hijack downstream execution. We evaluate Chameleon against Gemini 2.5 Flash model. Our experiments demonstrate that Chameleon achieves an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.5% across varying scaling factors, significantly outperforming static baseline attacks which average only 32.1%. Furthermore, we show that these attacks effectively compromise agentic pipelines, reducing decision-making accuracy by over 45% in multi-step tasks. Finally, we discuss the implications of these vulnerabilities and propose multi-scale consistency checks as a necessary defense mechanism."

Existing methods struggle to generalize to clinical volumes, due to pose ambiguities induced by inherent anatomical symmetries, as well as low resolution, noise, and artifacts. In contrast, E(3)-Pose captures anatomical symmetries and rigid pose equivariance by construction, and yields robust estimates of the fetal head pose. Our experiments on publicly available and representative clinical fetal MRI datasets demonstrate the superior robustness and generalization of our method across domains.

      "summary": "Object detection constitutes the primary task within the domain of computer vision. It is utilized in numerous domains. Nonetheless, object detection continues to encounter the issue of catastrophic forgetting. The model must be retrained whenever new products are introduced, utilizing not only the new products dataset but also the entirety of the previous dataset. The outcome is obvious: increasing model training expenses and significant time consumption. In numerous sectors, particularly retail checkout, the frequent introduction of new products presents a great challenge. This study introduces You Only Train Once (YOTO), a methodology designed to address the issue of catastrophic forgetting by integrating YOLO11n for object localization with DeIT and Proxy Anchor Loss for feature extraction and metric learning. For classification, we utilize cosine similarity between the embedding features of the target product and those in the Qdrant vector database. In a case study conducted in a retail store with 140 products, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves encouraging accuracy, whether for detecting new or existing products. Furthermore, without retraining, the training duration difference is significant. We achieve almost 3 times the training time efficiency compared to classical object detection approaches. This efficiency escalates as additional new products are added to the product database. The average inference time is 580 ms per image containing multiple products, on an edge device, validating the proposed framework's feasibility for practical use."

      "summary": "Real-time tracking of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on edge devices faces a fundamental resolution-speed conflict. Downsampling high-resolution imagery to standard detector input sizes causes small target features to collapse below detectable thresholds. Yet processing native 1080p frames on resource-constrained platforms yields insufficient throughput for smooth gimbal control. We propose SDG-Track, a Sparse Detection-Guided Tracker that adopts an Observer-Follower architecture to reconcile this conflict. The Observer stream runs a high-capacity detector at low frequency on the GPU to provide accurate position anchors from 1920x1080 frames. The Follower stream performs high-frequency trajectory interpolation via ROI-constrained sparse optical flow on the CPU. To handle tracking failures from occlusion or model drift caused by spectrally similar distractors, we introduce Dual-Space Recovery, a training-free re-acquisition mechanism combining color histogram matching with geometric consistency constraints. Experiments on a ground-to-air tracking station demonstrate that SDG-Track achieves 35.1 FPS system throughput while retaining 97.2\\% of the frame-by-frame detection precision. The system successfully tracks agile FPV drones under real-world operational conditions on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano. Our paper code is publicly available at https://github.com/Jeffry-wen/SDG-Track"

To address this limitation, we propose SP-Det, a novel self-prompted detection framework that automatically generates rich textual context to guide multi-label lesion detection without requiring expert annotations. Specifically, we introduce an expert-free dual-text prompt generator (DTPG) that leverages two complementary textual modalities: semantic context prompts that capture global pathological patterns and disease beacon prompts that focus on disease-specific manifestations. Moreover, we devise a bidirectional feature enhancer (BFE) that synergistically integrates comprehensive diagnostic context with disease-specific embeddings to significantly improve feature representation and detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on two chest X-ray datasets with diverse thoracic disease categories demonstrate that our SP-Det framework outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods while completely eliminating the dependency on expert-annotated prompts compared to existing promptable architectures."

The induced sequence of positive operators is monotone, admits an exact residual decomposition, and converges to the classical shorted operator. Transporting this dynamic to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces yields a corresponding family of kernels that converges to the largest kernel dominated by the original one and annihilating the given subspace. In the finite-sample setting, the associated Gram operators inherit a structured residual decomposition that leads to a canonical form of kernel ridge regression and a principled way to enforce nuisance invariance. This gives a unified operator-analytic approach to invariant kernel construction and structured regularization in data analysis."

Existing prompting strategies rely on static correlations rather than generative interpretations of dynamic behavior, lacking critical global and instance-specific context. To address this, we propose STELLA (Semantic-Temporal Alignment with Language Abstractions), a framework that systematically mines and injects structured supplementary and complementary information. STELLA employs a dynamic semantic abstraction mechanism that decouples input series into trend, seasonality, and residual components. It then translates intrinsic behavioral features of these components into Hierarchical Semantic Anchors: a Corpus-level Semantic Prior (CSP) for global context and a Fine-grained Behavioral Prompt (FBP) for instance-level patterns. Using these anchors as prefix-prompts, STELLA guides the LLM to model intrinsic dynamics. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that STELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long- and short-term forecasting, showing superior generalization in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our dynamically generated semantic anchors."

Existing approaches, whether end-to-end semantic parsing or stepwise agent-based reasoning, often suffer from structural inaccuracies and prohibitive computational costs, particularly when processing intricate queries over large knowledge graphs. To address these limitations, we introduce SEAL, a novel two-stage semantic parsing framework grounded in self-evolving agentic learning. In the first stage, a large language model (LLM) extracts a minimal S-expression core that captures the essential semantics of the input query. This core is then refined by an agentic calibration module, which corrects syntactic inconsistencies and aligns entities and relations precisely with the underlying knowledge graph. The second stage employs template-based completion, guided by question-type prediction and placeholder instantiation, to construct a fully executable S-expression. This decomposition not only simplifies logical form generation but also significantly enhances structural fidelity and linking efficiency. Crucially, SEAL incorporates a self-evolving mechanism that integrates local and global memory with a reflection module, enabling continuous adaptation from dialog history and execution feedback without explicit retraining. Extensive experiments on the SPICE benchmark demonstrate that SEAL achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in multi-hop reasoning, comparison, and aggregation tasks. The results validate notable gains in both structural accuracy and computational efficiency, underscoring the framework's capacity for robust and scalable conversational reasoning."

The construction allows to create large well-spaced vector collections in spaces of minimal possible dimension. If the number of classes is known or approximately predictable, one can choose sufficient enough vector collection size. If one needs to significantly extend the number of classes, one can extend the collection in the same latent space, or to incorporate the collection into collection of higher dimensions with same spacing between vectors. Also, regular symmetric structure of constructed vector collections can significantly simplify problems of search for nearest cluster centers or embeddings in the latent space.

We observe and define agentic upward deception, a phenomenon in which an agent facing environmental constraints conceals its failure and performs actions that were not requested without reporting. To assess its prevalence, we construct a benchmark of 200 tasks covering five task types and eight realistic scenarios in a constrained environment, such as broken tools or mismatched information sources. Evaluations of 11 popular LLMs reveal that these agents typically exhibit action-based deceptive behaviors, such as guessing results, performing unsupported simulations, substituting unavailable information sources, and fabricating local files. We further test prompt-based mitigation and find only limited reductions, suggesting that it is difficult to eliminate and highlighting the need for stronger mitigation strategies to ensure the safety of LLM-based agents."

In contrast, wearable bioimpedance sensing can cheaply and unobtrusively measure ground-truth skin-to-skin contact. Consequently, we propose a novel framework that combines visual pose estimators with bioimpedance sensing to capture the 3D pose of people by taking self-contact into account. Our method, BioTUCH, initializes the pose using an off-the-shelf estimator and introduces contact-aware pose optimization during measured self-contact: reprojection error and deviations from the input estimate are minimized while enforcing vertex proximity constraints. We validate our approach using a new dataset of synchronized RGB video, bioimpedance measurements, and 3D motion capture. Testing with three input pose estimators, we demonstrate an average of 11.7% improvement in reconstruction accuracy. We also present a miniature wearable bioimpedance sensor that enables efficient large-scale collection of contact-aware training data for improving pose estimation and generation using BioTUCH.

In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{LineAR}, a novel, training-free progressive key-value (KV) cache compression pipeline for autoregressive image generation. By fully exploiting the intrinsic characteristics of visual attention, LineAR manages the cache at the line level using a 2D view, preserving the visual dependency regions while progressively evicting less-informative tokens that are harmless for subsequent line generation, guided by inter-line attention. LineAR enables efficient autoregressive (AR) image generation by utilizing only a few lines of cache, achieving both memory savings and throughput speedup, while maintaining or even improving generation quality. Extensive experiments across six autoregressive image generation models, including class-conditional and text-to-image generation, validate its effectiveness and generality. LineAR improves ImageNet FID from 2.77 to 2.68 and COCO FID from 23.85 to 22.86 on LlamaGen-XL and Janus-Pro-1B, while retaining only 1/6 KV cache. It also improves DPG on Lumina-mGPT-768 with just 1/8 KV cache.

The results revealed that all current benchmarks assess isolated component capabilities, including data analysis quality, hypothesis validity, and experimental protocol design. However, authentic research collaboration requires integrated workflows spanning multiple sessions, with contextual memory, adaptive dialogue, and constraint propagation. This gap implies that systems excelling on component benchmarks may fail as practical research co-pilots. A process-oriented evaluation framework is proposed that addresses four critical dimensions absent from current benchmarks: dialogue quality, workflow orchestration, session continuity, and researcher experience. These dimensions are essential for evaluating AI systems as research co-pilots rather than as isolated task executors."

We introduce Source-Shielded Updates (SSU), a selective parameter update strategy that proactively preserves source knowledge. Using a small set of source data and a parameter importance scoring method, SSU identifies parameters critical to maintaining source abilities. It then applies a column-wise freezing strategy to protect these parameters before adaptation. Experiments across five typologically diverse languages and 7B and 13B models demonstrate that SSU successfully mitigates catastrophic forgetting. It reduces performance degradation on monolingual source tasks to just 3.4% (7B) and 2.8% (13B) on average, a stark contrast to the 20.3% and 22.3% from full fine-tuning. SSU also achieves target-language performance highly competitive with full fine-tuning, outperforming it on all benchmarks for 7B models and the majority for 13B models."

Accompanying this implementation, we provide the first comprehensive survey of causality-driven jailbreak studies and empirically evaluate the framework on multiple open-weight models and safety-critical benchmarks including jailbreaks, hallucination detection, backdoor identification, and fairness evaluation. Our results reveal that: (1) targeted interventions on causally critical components can reliably modify safety behavior; (2) safety-related mechanisms are highly localized (i.e., concentrated in early-to-middle layers with only 1--2\\% of neurons exhibiting causal influence); and (3) causal features extracted from our framework achieve over 95\\% detection accuracy across multiple threat types.\n  By bridging theoretical causality analysis and practical model safety, our framework establishes a reproducible foundation for research on causality-based attacks, interpretability, and robust attack detection and mitigation in LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Amadeuszhao/SOK_Casuality."

Although \"generalizable\" is the ultimate target once and for all, with limited training forgeries and domains, it appears idealistic to expect generalization that covers entirely unseen variations, especially given the diversity of real-world deepfakes. Therefore, introducing large-scale multi-domain data for training can be feasible and important for real-world applications. However, within such a multi-domain scenario, the differences between multiple domains, rather than the subtle real/fake distinctions, dominate the feature space. As a result, despite detectors being able to relatively separate real and fake within each domain (i.e., high AUC), they struggle with single-image real/fake judgments in domain-unspecified conditions (i.e., low ACC). In this paper, we first define a new research paradigm named Multi-In-Domain Face Forgery Detection (MID-FFD), which includes sufficient volumes of real-fake domains for training. Then, the detector should provide definitive real-fake judgments to the domain-unspecified inputs, which simulate the frame-by-frame independent detection scenario in the real world. Meanwhile, to address the domain-dominant issue, we propose a model-agnostic framework termed DevDet (Developer for Detector) to amplify real/fake differences and make them dominant in the feature space. DevDet consists of a Face Forgery Developer (FFDev) and a Dose-Adaptive detector Fine-Tuning strategy (DAFT). Experiments demonstrate our superiority in predicting real-fake under the MID-FFD scenario while maintaining original generalization ability to unseen data."

We address the question of how to tokenize buildings by unifying heterogeneous feature sets of architectural elements into sequences while preserving compositional structure. Such feature sets are represented as a sparse attribute-feature matrix that captures room properties. We then design a unified embedding module that learns joint representations of categorical and possibly correlated continuous feature groups. Lastly, we train a single Transformer backbone in two modes: an encoder-only pathway that yields high-fidelity room embeddings, and an encoder-decoder pipeline for autoregressive prediction of room entities, referred to as Data-Driven Entity Prediction (DDEP). Experiments across retrieval and generative layout synthesis show that SBM learns compact room embeddings that reliably cluster by type and topology, enabling strong semantic retrieval. In DDEP mode, SBM produces functionally sound layouts, with fewer collisions and boundary violations and improved navigability."

However, existing datasets and generative pipelines rarely provide consistent off-trajectory observations, limiting large-scale evaluation and training. While recent generative models demonstrate strong visual realism, they struggle to jointly achieve interpolation consistency and extrapolation realism without per-scene optimization. To address this, we propose FreeGen, a feed-forward reconstruction-generation co-training framework for free-viewpoint driving scene synthesis. The reconstruction model provides stable geometric representations to ensure interpolation consistency, while the generation model performs geometry-aware enhancement to improve realism at unseen viewpoints. Through co-training, generative priors are distilled into the reconstruction model to improve off-trajectory rendering, and the refined geometry in turn offers stronger structural guidance for generation. Experiments demonstrate that FreeGen achieves state-of-the-art performance for free-viewpoint driving scene synthesis."

Although relevant to areas such as cryptography, crystallography, and medical imaging, the problem remains unresolved: beyond a few special dimensions, neither optimal packings nor tight upper bounds are known. Even a major breakthrough in dimension $n=8$, later recognised with a Fields Medal, underscores its difficulty. A leading technique for upper bounds, the three-point method, reduces the problem to solving large, high-precision semidefinite programs (SDPs). Because each candidate SDP may take days to evaluate, standard data-intensive AI approaches are infeasible. We address this challenge by formulating SDP construction as a sequential decision process, the SDP game, in which a policy assembles SDP formulations from a set of admissible components. Using a sample-efficient model-based framework that combines Bayesian optimisation with Monte Carlo Tree Search, we obtain new state-of-the-art upper bounds in dimensions $4-16$, showing that model-based search can advance computational progress in longstanding geometric problems. Together, these results demonstrate that sample-efficient, model-based search can make tangible progress on mathematically rigid, evaluation limited problems, pointing towards a complementary direction for AI-assisted discovery beyond large-scale LLM-driven exploration."

However, MOS is a scalar that collapses heterogeneous user expectations, ignores service-level objectives, and is difficult to compare across deployment graphs. We propose a contract-driven QoE auditing framework: each service graph G is evaluated under a set of human-interpretable experience contracts C, yielding a contract-level satisfaction vector Q(G, C). We show that (i) classical MOS regression is a special case with a degenerate contract set, (ii) contract-driven quality is more stable than MOS under graph view transformations (e.g., pooling by system vs. by system type), and (iii) the effective sample complexity of learning contracts is governed by contract semantics rather than merely the dimensionality of C. We instantiate the framework on URGENT2024 MOS (6.9k speech utterances with raw rating vectors) and SingMOS v1 (7,981 singing clips; 80 systems). On URGENT, we train a contract-aware neural auditor on self-supervised WavLM embeddings; on SingMOS, we perform contract-driven graph auditing using released rating vectors and metadata without decoding audio. Empirically, our auditor matches strong MOS predictors in MOS accuracy while providing calibrated contract probabilities; on SingMOS, Q(G, C) exhibits substantially smaller cross-view drift than raw MOS and graph-only baselines; on URGENT, difficulty curves reveal that mis-specified \"simple\" contracts can be harder to learn than richer but better aligned contract sets."

It has demonstrated strong generative capabilities and attracted significant attention as a simulation-free flow-based framework capable of learning exact data densities. Motivated by these advances, we propose LatentFM, a flow-based model operating in the latent space for medical image segmentation. To model the data distribution, we first design two variational autoencoders (VAEs) to encode both medical images and their corresponding masks into a lower-dimensional latent space. We then estimate a conditional velocity field that guides the flow based on the input image. By sampling multiple latent representations, our method synthesizes diverse segmentation outputs whose pixel-wise variance reliably captures the underlying data distribution, enabling both highly accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions. Furthermore, we generate confidence maps that quantify the model certainty, providing clinicians with richer information for deeper analysis. We conduct experiments on two datasets, ISIC-2018 and CVC-Clinic, and compare our method with several prior baselines, including both deterministic and generative approach models. Through comprehensive evaluations, both qualitative and quantitative results show that our approach achieves superior segmentation accuracy while remaining highly efficient in the latent space."

However, existing methods struggle with accurately modeling in-the-wild scenes affected by transient objects and illuminations, leading to artifacts in the rendered images. We identify that the Gaussian densification process, while enhancing scene detail capture, unintentionally contributes to these artifacts by growing additional Gaussians that model transient disturbances and illumination variations. To address this, we propose RobustSplat++, a robust solution based on several critical designs. First, we introduce a delayed Gaussian growth strategy that prioritizes optimizing static scene structure before allowing Gaussian splitting/cloning, mitigating overfitting to transient objects in early optimization. Second, we design a scale-cascaded mask bootstrapping approach that first leverages lower-resolution feature similarity supervision for reliable initial transient mask estimation, taking advantage of its stronger semantic consistency and robustness to noise, and then progresses to high-resolution supervision to achieve more precise mask prediction. Third, we incorporate the delayed Gaussian growth strategy and mask bootstrapping with appearance modeling to handling in-the-wild scenes including transients and illuminations. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods, clearly demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our method."

Despite prior work on collecting large-scale datasets, there still remains a significant gap to robust spatial generalization. We identify a key limitation: individual trajectories, regardless of their length, are typically collected from a \\emph{single, static spatial configuration} of the environment. This includes fixed object and target spatial positions as well as unchanging camera viewpoints, which significantly restricts the diversity of spatial information available for learning. To address this critical bottleneck in data efficiency, we propose \\textbf{MOtion-Based Variability Enhancement} (\\emph{MOVE}), a simple yet effective data collection paradigm that enables the acquisition of richer spatial information from dynamic demonstrations. Our core contribution is an augmentation strategy that injects motion into any movable objects within the environment for each demonstration. This process implicitly generates a dense and diverse set of spatial configurations within a single trajectory. We conduct extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world environments to validate our approach. For example, in simulation tasks requiring strong spatial generalization, \\emph{MOVE} achieves an average success rate of 39.1\\%, a 76.1\\% relative improvement over the static data collection paradigm (22.2\\%), and yields up to 2--5$\\times$ gains in data efficiency on certain tasks.

Extensive experiments have shown that EMMA-4B can significantly outperform state-of-the-art unified multimodal approaches (e.g., BAGEL-7B) in both efficiency and performance, while also achieving competitive results compared to recent multimodal understanding and generation experts (e.g., Qwen3-VL and Qwen-Image).

However, previous approaches for building models of RNN dynamics that explain behaviour required iterative refinement of architectures and/or optimisation objectives, resulting in a piecemeal, and mostly heuristic, human-in-the-loop process. Here, we offer an alternative approach that automates the discovery of viable RNN mechanisms by explicitly training RNNs to reproduce behaviour, including the same characteristic errors and suboptimalities, that humans and animals produce in a cognitive task. Achieving this required two main innovations. First, as the amount of behavioural data that can be collected in experiments is often too limited to train RNNs, we use a non-parametric generative model of behavioural responses to produce surrogate data for training RNNs. Second, to capture all relevant statistical aspects of the data, we developed a novel diffusion model-based approach for training RNNs. To showcase the potential of our approach, we chose a visual working memory task as our test-bed, as behaviour in this task is well known to produce response distributions that are patently multimodal (due to swap errors). The resulting network dynamics correctly qualitative features of macaque neural data. Importantly, these results were not possible to obtain with more traditional approaches, i.e., when only a limited set of behavioural signatures (rather than the full richness of behavioural response distributions) were fitted, or when RNNs were trained for task optimality (instead of reproducing behaviour). Our approach also yields novel predictions about the mechanism of swap errors, which can be readily tested in experiments. These results suggest that fitting RNNs to rich patterns of behaviour provides a powerful way to automatically discover mechanisms of important cognitive functions."

However, existing native approaches are constrained by the absence of a powerful and versatile latent representation, which severely limits the fidelity and generality of their generated textures. We identify this representation gap as the principal barrier to further progress. We introduce LaFiTe, a framework that addresses this challenge by learning to generate textures as a 3D generative sparse latent color field. At its core, LaFiTe employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode complex surface appearance into a sparse, structured latent space, which is subsequently decoded into a continuous color field. This representation achieves unprecedented fidelity, exceeding state-of-the-art methods by >10 dB PSNR in reconstruction, by effectively disentangling texture appearance from mesh topology and UV parameterization. Building upon this strong representation, a conditional rectified-flow model synthesizes high-quality, coherent textures across diverse styles and geometries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaFiTe not only sets a new benchmark for 3D-native texturing but also enables flexible downstream applications such as material synthesis and texture super-resolution, paving the way for the next generation of 3D content creation workflows."

However, these systems introduce novel and evolving security challenges, including prompt injection attacks, context poisoning, model manipulation, and opaque agent-to-agent communication, that are not effectively captured by traditional threat modeling frameworks. In this paper, we introduce ASTRIDE, an automated threat modeling platform purpose-built for AI agent-based systems. ASTRIDE extends the classical STRIDE framework by introducing a new threat category, A for AI Agent-Specific Attacks, which encompasses emerging vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, unsafe tool invocation, and reasoning subversion, unique to agent-based applications. To automate threat modeling, ASTRIDE combines a consortium of fine-tuned vision-language models (VLMs) with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM to perform end-to-end analysis directly from visual agent architecture diagrams, such as data flow diagrams(DFDs). LLM agents orchestrate the end-to-end threat modeling automation process by coordinating interactions between the VLM consortium and the reasoning LLM. Our evaluations demonstrate that ASTRIDE provides accurate, scalable, and explainable threat modeling for next-generation intelligent systems. To the best of our knowledge, ASTRIDE is the first framework to both extend STRIDE with AI-specific threats and integrate fine-tuned VLMs with a reasoning LLM to fully automate diagram-driven threat modeling in AI agent-based applications."

In this paper, we describe Pick-to-Learn (P2L) for Systems and Control, a framework that allows any data-driven control method to be equipped with state-of-the-art safety and performance guarantees. P2L enables the use of all available data to jointly synthesize and certify the design, eliminating the need to set aside data for calibration or validation purposes. In presenting a comprehensive version of P2L for systems and control, this paper demonstrates its effectiveness across a range of core problems, including optimal control, reachability analysis, safe synthesis, and robust control. In many of these applications, P2L delivers designs and certificates that outperform commonly employed methods, and shows strong potential for broad applicability in diverse practical settings."

      "summary": "Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) remains constrained in practical deployment due to its strong dependence on accurate phoneme-level alignment and manually annotated melody contours, requirements that are resource-intensive and hinder scalability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a melody-driven SVS framework capable of synthesizing arbitrary lyrics following any reference melody, without relying on phoneme-level alignment. Our method builds on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, enhanced with a dedicated melody extraction module that derives melody representations directly from reference audio. To ensure robust melody encoding, we employ a teacher model to guide the optimization of the melody extractor, alongside an implicit alignment mechanism that enforces similarity distribution constraints for improved melodic stability and coherence. Additionally, we refine duration modeling using weakly annotated song data and introduce a Flow-GRPO reinforcement learning strategy with a multi-objective reward function to jointly enhance pronunciation clarity and melodic fidelity. Experiments show that our model achieves superior performance over existing approaches in both objective measures and subjective listening tests, especially in zero-shot and lyric adaptation settings, while maintaining high audio quality without manual annotation. This work offers a practical and scalable solution for advancing data-efficient singing voice synthesis. To support reproducibility, we release our inference code and model checkpoints."

      "summary": "Drones are becoming indispensable in many application domains. In data-driven missions, besides sensing, the drone must process the collected data at runtime to decide whether additional action must be taken on the spot, before moving to the next point of interest. If processing does not reveal an event or situation that requires such an action, the drone has waited in vain instead of moving to the next point. If, however, the drone starts moving to the next point and it turns out that a follow-up action is needed at the previous point, it must spend time to fly-back. To take this decision, we propose different machine-learning methods based on branch prediction and reinforcement learning. We evaluate these methods for a wide range of scenarios where the probability of event occurrence changes with time. Our results show that the proposed methods consistently outperform the regression-based method proposed in the literature and can significantly improve the worst-case mission time by up to 4.1x. Also, the achieved median mission time is very close, merely up to 2.7% higher, to that of a method with perfect knowledge of the current underlying event probability at each point of interest."

However, research studies in robotics and autonomous navigation often rely on controlled simulations or isolated field trials. The absence of a realistic common benchmark represents a significant limitation for the diffusion of robust autonomous systems under real complex agricultural conditions. Vineyards pose significant challenges due to their dynamic nature, and they are increasingly drawing attention from both academic and industrial stakeholders interested in automation. In this context, we introduce the TEMPO-VINE dataset, a large-scale multi-temporal dataset specifically designed for evaluating sensor fusion, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and place recognition techniques within operational vineyard environments. TEMPO-VINE is the first multi-modal public dataset that brings together data from heterogeneous LiDARs of different price levels, AHRS, RTK-GPS, and cameras in real trellis and pergola vineyards, with multiple rows exceeding 100 m in length. In this work, we address a critical gap in the landscape of agricultural datasets by providing researchers with a comprehensive data collection and ground truth trajectories in different seasons, vegetation growth stages, terrain and weather conditions. The sequence paths with multiple runs and revisits will foster the development of sensor fusion, localization, mapping and place recognition solutions for agricultural fields. The dataset, the processing tools and the benchmarking results will be available at the dedicated webpage upon acceptance."

Where $ε$-machines capture the predictive temporal structure and intrinsic computation of ABM-generated time series, diffusion models characterize high-dimensional cross-sectional distributions, learn underlying data manifolds, and enable synthetic generation of plausible population-level outcomes. We provide a formal analysis demonstrating that the two approaches operate on distinct mathematical domains -- processes vs. distributions -- and show that their combination yields a two-axis representation of ABM behavior based on temporal organization and distributional geometry. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to integrate computational mechanics with score-based generative modeling for the structural analysis of ABM outputs, thereby situating ABM characterization within the broader landscape of modern machine-learning methods for density estimation and intrinsic computation. The framework is validated using the same elder-caregiver ABM dataset introduced in the companion paper, and we provide precise definitions and propositions formalizing the mathematical complementarity between $ε$-machines and diffusion models. This establishes a principled methodology for jointly analyzing temporal predictability and high-dimensional distributional structure in complex simulation models."

This integrated approach facilitates richer environmental interactions and robust task performance. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of recent advances in ECD. We first formalize the concept of ECD and position it within related fields. We then introduce a hierarchical taxonomy: a lower layer that breaks down agent design into three fundamental components-controlling brain, body morphology, and task environment-and an upper layer that integrates these components into four major ECD frameworks: bi-level, single-level, generative, and open-ended. This taxonomy allows us to synthesize insights from more than one hundred recent studies. We further review notable benchmarks, datasets, and applications in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Finally, we identify significant challenges and offer insights into promising future research directions.

In a nutshell, XIL algorithms select a number of items on which an AI model made a decision (e.g. images and their tags) and present them to users, together with corresponding explanations (e.g. image regions that drive the model's decision). Then, users supply corrective feedback for the explanations, which the algorithm uses to improve the model. Despite showing promise in debugging tasks, recent studies have raised concerns that explanatory interaction may trigger order effects, a well-known cognitive bias in which the sequence of presented items influences users' trust and, critically, the quality of their feedback. We argue that these studies are not entirely conclusive, as the experimental designs and tasks employed differ substantially from common XIL use cases, complicating interpretation. To clarify the interplay between order effects and explanatory interaction, we ran two larger-scale user studies (n = 713 total) designed to mimic common XIL tasks. Specifically, we assessed order effects both within and between debugging sessions by manipulating the order in which correct and wrong explanations are presented to participants. Order effects had a limited, through significant impact on users' agreement with the model (i.e., a behavioral measure of their trust), and only when examined withing debugging sessions, not between them. The quality of users' feedback was generally satisfactory, with order effects exerting only a small and inconsistent influence in both experiments. Overall, our findings suggest that order effects do not pose a significant issue for the successful employment of XIL approaches. More broadly, our work contributes to the ongoing efforts for understanding human factors in AI."

Such memory-based personalization is also key in on-device settings that allow users to keep their conversations and data private. However, memory-augmented systems typically rely on LLMs that are too costly for local on-device deployment. Even though Small Language Models (SLMs) are more suitable for on-device inference than LLMs, they cannot achieve sufficient performance. Additionally, these LLM-based systems lack native visual capabilities, limiting their applicability in multimodal contexts. In this paper, we introduce (i) MemLoRA, a novel memory system that enables local deployment by equipping SLMs with specialized memory adapters, and (ii) its vision extension MemLoRA-V, which integrates small Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) to memory systems, enabling native visual understanding. Following knowledge distillation principles, each adapter is trained separately for specific memory operations$\\unicode{x2013}$knowledge extraction, memory update, and memory-augmented generation. Equipped with memory adapters, small models enable accurate on-device memory operations without cloud dependency.

To evaluate visual understanding operations instead, we extend LoCoMo with challenging Visual Question Answering tasks that require direct visual reasoning. On this, our VLM-integrated MemLoRA-V shows massive improvements over caption-based approaches (81.3 vs. 23.7 accuracy) while keeping strong performance in text-based tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of our method in multimodal contexts."

The generation stage generates samples that are then used to infer learnable experiences for training. We observe that the generation stage is the bottleneck of the entire execution process and consider it a key point for optimization. Specifically, we realize the first attempt to integrate speculative decoding into the RLHF generation stage and propose RLHFSpec, an RLHF system that accelerates generation execution with adaptive speculative decoding and sample reallocation. To fully exploit the performance potential provided by speculative decoding, especially dealing with the dynamic workload of the generation stage, RLHFSpec proposes a workload-aware drafting strategy selection mechanism, which selects the near-optimal strategy by jointly considering the verification cost and the number of accepted tokens. Moreover, RLHFSpec also proposes sample reallocation to fully utilize the GPU resources, and optimizes it with an efficient sample migration mechanism. The experimental results show that the RLHFSpec can achieve higher throughput in the generation stage compared to state-of-the-art works. Moreover, due to the effective alleviation of the generation bottleneck, RLHFSpec also shows significant performance speedup in the entire RLHF execution."

To evaluate robustness, we construct a synthetic dataset that incorporates atmospheric effects and diverse noise patterns, representative of realistic InSAR observations. Experiments show that the proposed model leverages the conditional prior while reducing the effect of diverse noise patterns, achieving on average a 10.11\\% reduction in NRMSE compared to SNAPHU. It also achieves better reconstruction quality in difficult cases such as dyke intrusions."

Core methodological topics include loss-function design, parameter-estimation principles, ordinary least squares, gradient-based optimization algorithms and their variants, as well as regularization techniques such as Ridge and LASSO regression. Through detailed mathematical derivations, illustrative examples, and intuitive visual explanations, the materials help students understand not only how regression models are constructed and optimized, but also how they reveal the underlying relationships between features and response variables.

Here we introduce GateMod, an interpretable theoretically grounded computational model linking the emergence of gating to the underlying decision-making task, and to a neural circuit architecture. We first develop GateFrame, a normative framework casting policy gating into the minimization of the free energy. This framework, relating gating rules to task, applies broadly across neuroscience, cognitive and computational sciences. We then derive GateFlow, a continuous-time energy based dynamics that provably converges to GateFrame optimal solution. Convergence, exponential and global, follows from a contractivity property that also yields robustness and other desirable properties. Finally, we derive a neural circuit from GateFlow, GateNet. This is a soft-competitive recurrent circuit whose components perform local and contextual computations consistent with known dendritic and neural processing motifs. We evaluate GateMod across two different settings: collective behaviors in multi-agent systems and human decision-making in multi-armed bandits. In all settings, GateMod provides interpretable mechanistic explanations of gating and quantitatively matches or outperforms established models. GateMod offers a unifying framework for neural policy gating, linking task objectives, dynamical computation, and circuit-level mechanisms. It provides a framework to understand gating in natural agents beyond current explanations and to equip machines with this ability."

In this paper, we present OsmT, an open-source tag-aware language model specifically designed to bridge natural language and Overpass Query Language (OverpassQL), a structured query language for accessing large-scale OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. To enhance the accuracy and structural validity of generated queries, we introduce a Tag Retrieval Augmentation (TRA) mechanism that incorporates contextually relevant tag knowledge into the generation process. This mechanism is designed to capture the hierarchical and relational dependencies present in the OSM database, addressing the topological complexity inherent in geospatial query formulation. In addition, we define a reverse task, OverpassQL-to-Text, which translates structured queries into natural language explanations to support query interpretation and improve user accessibility. We evaluate OsmT on a public benchmark against strong baselines and observe consistent improvements in both query generation and interpretation. Despite using significantly fewer parameters, our model achieves competitive accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of open-source pre-trained language models in bridging natural language and structured query languages within schema-rich geospatial environments."

While many existing approaches rely on semantic segmentation to guide depth completion, they often overlook the benefits of object-level understanding. In this work, we introduce an instance-aware depth completion framework that explicitly integrates binary instance masks as spatial priors to refine depth predictions. Our model combines four main components: a frozen YOLO V11 instance segmentation branch, a U-Net-based depth completion backbone, a cross-attention fusion module, and an attention-guided prediction head. The instance segmentation branch generates per-image foreground masks that guide the depth branch via cross-attention, allowing the network to focus on object-centric regions during refinement. We validate our method on the Virtual KITTI 2 dataset, showing that it achieves lower RMSE compared to both a U-Net-only baseline and previous semantic-guided methods, while maintaining competitive MAE. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively enhances depth accuracy near object boundaries, occlusions, and thin structures. Our findings suggest that incorporating instance-aware cues offers a promising direction for improving depth completion without relying on dense semantic labels."

A consistency-oriented training scheme, combining modality pretraining with preference-based alignment, further enforces coherence between emotional intent and driving actions.

To address this issue, we observe that if domain-invariant features are utilized during policy training in simulation, and the same features can be extracted and provided as the input to policy during real-world deployment, the domain gap can be effectively bridged, leading to significantly improved policy generalization. Accordingly, we propose Semantic 2D Gaussian Splatting (S2GS), a novel representation method that extracts object-centric, domain-invariant spatial features. S2GS constructs multi-view 2D semantic fields and projects them into a unified 3D space via feature-level Gaussian splatting. A semantic filtering mechanism removes irrelevant background content, ensuring clean and consistent inputs for policy learning. To evaluate the effectiveness of S2GS, we adopt Diffusion Policy as the downstream learning algorithm and conduct experiments in the ManiSkill simulation environment, followed by real-world deployment. Results demonstrate that S2GS significantly improves sim-to-real transferability, maintaining high and stable task performance in real-world scenarios."

Previous research has demonstrated that recurrent architectures can only approximately track and enumerate sequences of events, and it remains unclear whether modern deep learning systems, including LLMs, can deploy systematic counting procedures over sequences of discrete symbols. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the sequential enumeration abilities of five state-of-the-art LLMs, including proprietary, open-source, and reasoning models. We probe LLMs in sequential naming and production tasks involving lists of letters and words, adopting a variety of prompting instructions to explore the role of chain-of-thought in the spontaneous emerging of counting strategies. We also evaluate open-source models with the same architecture but increasing size to see whether the mastering of counting principles follows scaling laws, and we analyze the embedding dynamics during sequential enumeration to investigate the emergent encoding of numerosity. We find that some LLMs are indeed capable of deploying counting procedures when explicitly prompted to do so, but none of them spontaneously engage in counting when simply asked to enumerate the number of items in a sequence. Our results suggest that, despite their impressive emergent abilities, LLMs cannot yet robustly and systematically deploy counting procedures, highlighting a persistent gap between neural and symbolic approaches to compositional generalization."

This work proposes an AI Fluid Scientist framework that autonomously executes the complete experimental workflow: hypothesis generation, experimental design, robotic execution, data analysis, and manuscript preparation. We validate this through investigation of vortex-induced vibration (VIV) and wake-induced vibration (WIV) in tandem cylinders. Our work has four key contributions: (1) A computer-controlled circulating water tunnel (CWT) with programmatic control of flow velocity, cylinder position, and forcing parameters (vibration frequency and amplitude) with data acquisition (displacement, force, and torque). (2) Automated experiments reproduce literature benchmarks (Khalak and Williamson [1999] and Assi et al. [2013, 2010]) with frequency lock-in within 4% and matching critical spacing trends. (3) The framework with Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) discovers more WIV amplitude response phenomena, and uses a neural network to fit physical laws from data, which is 31% higher than that of polynomial fitting. (4) The framework with multi-agent with virtual-real interaction system executes hundreds of experiments end-to-end, which automatically completes the entire process of scientific research from hypothesis generation, experimental design, experimental execution, data analysis, and manuscript preparation. It greatly liberates human researchers and improves study efficiency, providing new paradigm for the development and research of experimental fluid mechanics."

Recent advances indicate that generative large models pre-trained on massive datasets, can achieve outstanding performance arexhibit exceptional performance across diverse downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. To exploit the rich semantic knowledge embedded in large models and enable adaptive transmission over lossy channels, we propose a Large Speech Model enabled Semantic Communication (LargeSC) system. Simultaneously achieving adaptive compression and robust transmission over lossy channels remains challenging, requiring trade-offs among compression efficiency, speech quality, and latency. In this work, we employ the Mimi as a speech codec, converting speech into discrete tokens compatible with existing network architectures. We propose an adaptive controller module that enables adaptive transmission and in-band Unequal Error Protection (UEP), dynamically adjusting to both speech content and packet loss probability under bandwidth constraints. Additionally, we employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to finetune the Moshi foundation model for generative recovery of lost speech tokens. Simulation results show that the proposed system supports bandwidths ranging from 550 bps to 2.06 kbps, outperforms conventional baselines in speech quality under high packet loss rates and achieves an end-to-end latency of approximately 460 ms, thereby demonstrating its potential for real-time deployment."

Early Exiting Neural Networks (EENN) have emerged as a promising solution, allowing dynamic termination of inference based on input complexity to enhance efficiency. Despite their potential, EENN performance is highly influenced by the heterogeneity of edge accelerators and the constraints imposed by quantization, affecting accuracy, energy efficiency, and latency. Yet, research on the automatic optimization of EENN design for edge hardware remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose a hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework that systematically integrates the effects of quantization and hardware resource allocation to optimize the placement of early exit points within a network backbone. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate that our NAS framework can discover architectures that achieve over a 50\\% reduction in computational costs compared to conventional static networks, making them more suitable for deployment in resource-constrained edge environments."

In this article, we propose a stochastic, continuous-time approximation to SGDo with additive noise based on a Young differential equation driven by a stochastic process we call an \"epoched Brownian motion\". We show its usefulness by proving the almost sure convergence of the continuous-time approximation for strongly convex objectives and learning rate schedules of the form $u_t = \\frac{1}{(1+t)^β}, β\\in (0,1)$. Moreover, we compute an upper bound on the asymptotic rate of almost sure convergence, which is as good or better than previous results for SGDo."

      "summary": "Arbitrary-scale super-resolution (ASSR) overcomes the limitation of traditional super-resolution (SR) methods that operate only at fixed scales (e.g., 4x), enabling a single model to handle arbitrary magnification. Most existing ASSR approaches rely on implicit neural representation (INR), but its regression-driven feature extraction and aggregation intrinsically limit the ability to synthesize fine details, leading to low realism. Recent diffusion-based realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) models leverage powerful pre-trained diffusion priors and show impressive results at the 4x setting. We observe that they can also achieve ASSR because the diffusion prior implicitly adapts to scale by encouraging high-realism generation. However, without explicit scale control, the diffusion process cannot be properly adjusted for different magnification levels, resulting in excessive hallucination or blurry outputs, especially under ultra-high scales. To address these issues, we propose OmniScaleSR, a diffusion-based realistic arbitrary-scale SR framework designed to achieve both high fidelity and high realism. We introduce explicit, diffusion-native scale control mechanisms that work synergistically with implicit scale adaptation, enabling scale-aware and content-aware modulation of the diffusion process. In addition, we incorporate multi-domain fidelity enhancement designs to further improve reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on bicubic degradation benchmarks and real-world datasets show that OmniScaleSR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both fidelity and perceptual realism, with particularly strong performance at large magnification factors.

We establish the well-posedness of the associated system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations and provide a characterization of the optimal policy. The policy improvement and the convergence of the policy iterations are rigorously established by analyzing the system of equations. We also show the convergence of the value function in the exploratory formulation towards the value function in the classical formulation as the temperature parameter vanishes. Finally, a reinforcement learning algorithm is devised and implemented by invoking the policy evaluation based on the martingale characterization. Our numerical examples with the aid of neural networks illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed RL algorithm."

The method applies to architectures whose first layer is fully connected. From the second layer onward, it accommodates multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) of arbitrary width and depth, convolutional and recurrent networks, attention mechanisms, residual connections, and dropout. The procedure also accommodates stochastic gradient descent with data-independent initializations and learning rates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to provide a theoretical guarantee of FDR control for feature selection within such a general deep learning setting.\n  Our analysis is built upon a multi-index data-generating model and an asymptotic regime in which the feature dimension $n$ diverges faster than the latent dimension $q^{*}$, while the sample size, the number of training iterations, the network depth, and hidden layer widths are left unrestricted. Under this setting, we show that each coordinate of the gradient-based feature-importance vector admits a marginal normal approximation, thereby supporting the validity of asymptotic FDR control. As a theoretical limitation, we assume $\\mathbf{B}$-right orthogonal invariance of the design matrix, and we discuss broader generalizations. We also present numerical experiments that underscore the theoretical findings."

Trinity addresses this with a lightweight coordinator that orchestrates collaboration among large language models (LLMs). The coordinator, comprising a compact language model (approximately $0.6$B parameters) and a lightweight head (approximately $10$K parameters), is optimized with an evolutionary strategy for efficient and adaptive delegation. Trinity processes queries over multiple turns, where at each turn the coordinator assigns one of three roles (Thinker, Worker, or Verifier) to a selected LLM, effectively offloading complex skill acquisition from the coordinator itself. Experiments show that Trinity consistently outperforms individual models and existing methods across coding, math, reasoning, and domain knowledge tasks, and generalizes robustly to out-of-distribution tasks. On standard benchmarks, Trinity achieves state-of-the-art results, including a score of 86.2% on LiveCodeBench. Theoretical and empirical analyses identify two main factors behind this performance: (1) the coordinator's hidden-state representations provide rich contextualization of inputs, and (2) under high dimensionality and strict budget constraints, the separable Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy offers advantages over reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and random search by exploiting potential block-epsilon-separability."

These capabilities are highly aligned with the functionalities required in SASs, suggesting a strong potential to employ GenAI to enhance SASs. However, the specific benefits and challenges of employing GenAI in SASs remain unclear. Yet, providing a comprehensive understanding of these benefits and challenges is complex due to several reasons: limited publications in the SAS field, the technological and application diversity within SASs, and the rapid evolution of GenAI technologies. To that end, this paper aims to provide researchers and practitioners a comprehensive snapshot that outlines the potential benefits and challenges of employing GenAI's within SAS. Specifically, we gather, filter, and analyze literature from four distinct research fields and organize them into two main categories to potential benefits: (i) enhancements to the autonomy of SASs centered around the specific functions of the MAPE-K feedback loop, and (ii) improvements in the interaction between humans and SASs within human-on-the-loop settings. From our study, we outline a research roadmap that highlights the challenges of integrating GenAI into SASs. The roadmap starts with outlining key research challenges that need to be tackled to exploit the potential for applying GenAI in the field of SAS.

Existing methods distill few-step video diffusion models with sliding window attention, using initial frames as sink tokens to maintain attention performance and reduce error accumulation. However, video frames become overly dependent on these static tokens, resulting in copied initial frames and diminished motion dynamics. To address this, we introduce Reward Forcing, a novel framework with two key designs. First, we propose EMA-Sink, which maintains fixed-size tokens initialized from initial frames and continuously updated by fusing evicted tokens via exponential moving average as they exit the sliding window. Without additional computation cost, EMA-Sink tokens capture both long-term context and recent dynamics, preventing initial frame copying while maintaining long-horizon consistency. Second, to better distill motion dynamics from teacher models, we propose a novel Rewarded Distribution Matching Distillation (Re-DMD). Vanilla distribution matching treats every training sample equally, limiting the model's ability to prioritize dynamic content. Instead, Re-DMD biases the model's output distribution toward high-reward regions by prioritizing samples with greater dynamics rated by a vision-language model. Re-DMD significantly enhances motion quality while preserving data fidelity. We include both quantitative and qualitative experiments to show that Reward Forcing achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks while enabling high-quality streaming video generation at 23.1 FPS on a single H100 GPU."

MAMA operates on synthetic documents containing labeled Personally Identifiable Information (PII) entities, from which we generate sanitized task instructions. We execute a two-phase protocol: Engram (seeding private information into a target agent's memory) and Resonance (multi-round interaction where an attacker attempts extraction). Over up to 10 interaction rounds, we quantify leakage as the fraction of ground-truth PII recovered from attacking agent outputs via exact matching. We systematically evaluate six common network topologies (fully connected, ring, chain, binary tree, star, and star-ring), varying agent counts $n\\in\\{4,5,6\\}$, attacker-target placements, and base models. Our findings reveal consistent patterns: fully connected graphs exhibit maximum leakage while chains provide strongest protection; shorter attacker-target graph distance and higher target centrality significantly increase vulnerability; leakage rises sharply in early rounds before plateauing; model choice shifts absolute leakage rates but preserves topology rankings; temporal/locational PII attributes leak more readily than identity credentials or regulated identifiers. These results provide the first systematic mapping from architectural choices to measurable privacy risk, yielding actionable guidance: prefer sparse or hierarchical connectivity, maximize attacker-target separation, limit node degree and network radius, avoid shortcuts bypassing hubs, and implement topology-aware access controls."

Existing image editing benchmarks generally suffer from limited task scopes, insufficient evaluation dimensions, and heavy reliance on manual annotations, which significantly constrain their scalability and practical applicability. To address this, we propose \\textbf{I2I-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark for image-to-image editing models, which features (i) diverse tasks, encompassing 10 task categories across both single-image and multi-image editing tasks, (ii) comprehensive evaluation dimensions, including 30 decoupled and fine-grained evaluation dimensions with automated hybrid evaluation methods that integrate specialized tools and large multimodal models (LMMs), and (iii) rigorous alignment validation, justifying the consistency between our benchmark evaluations and human preferences. Using I2I-Bench, we benchmark numerous mainstream image editing models, investigating the gaps and trade-offs between editing models across various dimensions. We will open-source all components of I2I-Bench to facilitate future research."

      "summary": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) of multiple intersections. Existing approaches typically follow either a fully centralized or a fully decentralized design. Fully centralized approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and reliance on a single learning server, whereas purely decentralized approaches operate under severe partial observability and lack explicit coordination resulting in suboptimal performance. These limitations motivate region-based MARL, where the network is partitioned into smaller, tightly coupled intersections that form regions, and training is organized around these regions. This paper introduces a Semi-Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (SEMI-CTDE) architecture for multi intersection ATSC. Within each region, SEMI-CTDE performs centralized training with regional parameter sharing and employs composite state and reward formulations that jointly encode local and regional information. The architecture is highly transferable across different policy backbones and state-reward instantiations. Building on this architecture, we implement two models with distinct design objectives. A multi-perspective experimental analysis of the two implemented SEMI-CTDE-based models covering ablations of the architecture's core elements including rule based and fully decentralized baselines shows that they achieve consistently superior performance and remain effective across a wide range of traffic densities and distributions."

      "summary": "Earth observation (EO) models are frequently trained under implicit sampling policies that optimize global accuracy but provide no explicit guarantees on who (which regions, classes, or mission-critical strata) is being served throughout training. This paper introduces a contract-governed training paradigm for EO in which training samples are grouped into service contracts -- semantically meaningful units such as (dataset, region, rare-crop indicator) -- and each contract is assigned a target service share. We instantiate this paradigm as an Observed Service Agreement Graph (OSAG), a lightweight governance layer that (i) monitors contract-level exposure (coverage) during optimization, (ii) drives empirical coverage toward target shares via contract-normalized sampling weights, and (iii) exposes explicit accuracy-governance trade-offs through two knobs: a sampling mixture coefficient alpha and a contract-regularization weight lambda_C. We provide a compact theory in a toy setting: OSAG sampling concentrates empirical coverage to targets; coverage deviations upper-bound service-risk deviations; and contract design (coarse vs. fine) modulates governance cost. Experiments on AVIRIS hyperspectral scenes (Indian Pines plus Salinas) and multispectral Sentinel-2 EuroSAT demonstrate that OSAG can substantially reduce priority coverage error while maintaining global accuracy and improving high-priority accuracy. A EuroSAT coarse-vs-fine contract ablation further evidences how semantically refined contracts can reduce the accuracy cost per unit of governance improvement."

However, these models still struggle to effectively perceive and exploit rich temporal information in videos when responding to user queries. Therefore, they often generate descriptions of events that are temporal inconsistent or causally implausible, causing severe hallucination issues. While most prior studies have focused on spatial hallucinations (e.g. object mismatches), temporal reasoning in video understanding remains relatively underexplored. To address this issue, we propose Self-Diagnostic Contrastive Decoding (SEASON), a training-free method that adaptively enhances temporal and spatial faithfulness for each output token. It achieves this by dynamically diagnosing each token's hallucination tendency and applying adaptive contrastive decoding against its corresponding temporal and spatial negatives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEASON outperforms all existing training-free hallucination mitigation approaches on three hallucination examination benchmarks, while further improves VideoLLMs across four general video understanding benchmarks. The code will be released upon acceptance."

However, these methods rely on a costly gradient orthogonalization step. Even efficient iterative approximations such as Newton-Schulz remain expensive, typically requiring dozens of matrix multiplications to converge. We introduce a preconditioning procedure that accelerates Newton-Schulz convergence and reduces its computational cost. We evaluate its impact and show that the overhead of our preconditioning can be made negligible. Furthermore, the faster convergence it enables allows us to remove one iteration out of the usual five without degrading approximation quality. Our publicly available implementation achieves up to a 2.8x speedup in the Newton-Schulz approximation. We also show that this has a direct impact on end-to-end training runtime with 5-10% improvement in realistic training scenarios across two efficiency-focused tasks. On challenging language or vision tasks, we validate that our method maintains equal or superior model performance while improving runtime. Crucially, these improvements require no hyperparameter tuning and can be adopted as a simple drop-in replacement. Our code is publicly available on github."

However, this transition has been revisited with the advent of Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD), which re-emphasizes the importance of logit knowledge through advanced decoupling and weighting strategies. While DKD marks a significant advancement, its underlying mechanisms merit deeper exploration. As a response, we rethink DKD from a predictive distribution perspective. First, we introduce an enhanced version, the Generalized Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (GDKD) loss, which offers a more versatile method for decoupling logits. Then we pay particular attention to the teacher model's predictive distribution and its impact on the gradients of GDKD loss, uncovering two critical insights often overlooked: (1) the partitioning by the top logit considerably improves the interrelationship of non-top logits, and (2) amplifying the focus on the distillation loss of non-top logits enhances the knowledge extraction among them. Utilizing these insights, we further propose a streamlined GDKD algorithm with an efficient partition strategy to handle the multimodality of teacher models' predictive distribution. Our comprehensive experiments conducted on a variety of benchmarks, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet, Tiny-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, and Cityscapes, demonstrate GDKD's superior performance over both the original DKD and other leading knowledge distillation methods.

To better understand how they encode spatiotemporal information, we analyze the internal representations of Video Diffusion Transformer (VDiT). Our analysis reveals that attention heads act as minimal functional units with distinct specializations for matching, semantic understanding, and positional encoding. Additionally, we find that the low-frequency components in VDiT features are crucial for establishing correspondences, whereas the high-frequency components tend to introduce noise. Building on these insights, we propose a head- and frequency-aware feature selection strategy that jointly selects the most informative attention head and low-frequency components to enhance tracking performance. Specifically, our method extracts discriminative features through single-step denoising, applies feature selection, and employs soft-argmax localization with forward-backward consistency checks for correspondence estimation. Extensive experiments on TAP-Vid benchmarks demonstrate that HeFT achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot tracking performance, approaching the accuracy of supervised methods while eliminating the need for annotated training data. Our work further underscores the promise of video diffusion models as powerful foundation models for a wide range of downstream tasks, paving the way toward unified visual foundation models."

A number of recent studies have demonstrated convincing reconstruction of intelligible speech from surface electrocorticographic (ECoG) or intracortical recordings by predicting a series of phonemes or words and using downstream language models to obtain meaningful sentences. A current challenge is to reconstruct speech in a streaming mode by directly regressing cortical signals into acoustic speech. While this has been achieved recently using intracortical data, further work is needed to obtain comparable results with surface ECoG recordings. In particular, optimizing neural decoders becomes critical in this case. Here we present an offline speech decoding pipeline based on an encoder-decoder deep neural architecture, integrating Vision Transformers and contrastive learning to enhance the direct regression of speech from ECoG signals. The approach is evaluated on two datasets, one obtained with clinical subdural electrodes in an epileptic patient, and another obtained with the fully implantable WIMAGINE epidural system in a participant of a motor BCI trial. To our knowledge this presents a first attempt to decode speech from a fully implantable and wireless epidural recording system offering perspectives for long-term use."

To this end, we develop a formal framework for score matching on finite point processes via Janossy measures and, within this framework, introduce an (autoregressive) weighted score-matching estimator, whose statistical properties we analyze in classical parametric settings. For general nonparametric (e.g., deep) point process models, we show that score matching alone does not uniquely identify the ground-truth distribution due to subtle normalization issues, and we propose a simple survival-classification augmentation that yields a complete, integration-free training objective for any intensity-based point process model for spatio-temporal case. Experiments on synthetic and real-world temporal and spatio-temporal datasets, demonstrate that our method accurately recovers intensities and achieves performance comparable to MLE with better efficiency."

In the absence of expert demonstrations, training LLM agents has relied on policy gradient methods that optimize LLM policies with respect to an (often sparse) reward function. However, in long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, learning from trajectory-level rewards can be noisy, leading to training that is unstable and has high sample complexity. Furthermore, policy improvement hinges on discovering better actions through exploration, which can be difficult when actions lie in natural language space. In this paper, we propose Natural Language Actor-Critic (NLAC), a novel actor-critic algorithm that trains LLM policies using a generative LLM critic that produces natural language rather than scalar values. This approach leverages the inherent strengths of LLMs to provide a richer and more actionable training signal; particularly, in tasks with large, open-ended action spaces, natural language explanations for why an action is suboptimal can be immensely useful for LLM policies to reason how to improve their actions, without relying on random exploration. Furthermore, our approach can be trained off-policy without policy gradients, offering a more data-efficient and stable alternative to existing on-policy methods. We present results on a mixture of reasoning, web browsing, and tool-use with dialogue tasks, demonstrating that NLAC shows promise in outperforming existing training approaches and offers a more scalable and stable training paradigm for LLM agents."

We introduce a zero-shot pipeline that simultaneously (i) detects if an image contains harmful content, (ii) identifies each critical element involved, and (iii) localizes those elements with pixel-accurate masks - all in one pass. The system first applies foundation segmentation model (SAM) to generate candidate object masks and refines them into larger independent regions. Each region is scored for malicious relevance by a vision-language model using open-vocabulary prompts; these scores weight a fusion step that produces a consolidated malicious object map. An ensemble across multiple segmenters hardens the pipeline against adaptive attacks that target any single segmentation method. Evaluated on a newly-annotated 790-image dataset spanning drug, sexual, violent and extremist content, our method attains 85.8% element-level recall, 78.1% precision and a 92.1% segment-success rate - exceeding direct zero-shot VLM localization by 27.4% recall at comparable precision. Against PGD adversarial perturbations crafted to break SAM and VLM, our method's precision and recall decreased by no more than 10%, demonstrating high robustness against attacks.

In this work, we focus on a minimal requirement for EQA agents, abstention: knowing when to withhold an answer. From an initial study of 500 human queries, we find that 32.4% contain missing or underspecified context. Drawing on this initial study and cognitive theories of human communication errors, we derive five representative categories requiring abstention: actionability limitation, referential underspecification, preference dependence, information unavailability, and false presupposition. We augment OpenEQA by having annotators transform well-posed questions into ambiguous variants outlined by these categories. The resulting dataset, AbstainEQA, comprises 1,636 annotated abstention cases paired with 1,636 original OpenEQA instances for balanced evaluation. Evaluating on AbstainEQA, we find that even the best frontier model only attains 42.79% abstention recall, while humans achieve 91.17%. We also find that scaling, prompting, and reasoning only yield marginal gains, and that fine-tuned models overfit to textual cues. Together, these results position abstention as a fundamental prerequisite for reliable interaction in embodied settings and as a necessary basis for effective clarification."

To address these challenges, this paper introduces \\emph{QoSDiff}, a novel embedding learning framework that bypasses the prerequisite of explicit graph construction. Specifically, it leverages a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to recover intrinsic latent structures from noisy initializations. To further capture high-order interactions, we propose an adversarial interaction module that integrates a bidirectional hybrid attention mechanism. This adversarial paradigm dynamically distinguishes informative patterns from noise, enabling a dual-perspective modeling of intricate user--service associations.

Currently, SAM3 relies on external multi-modal agents to convert complex instructions into NPs and then conduct iterative mask filtering. However, these NP-level concepts remain overly coarse, often failing to precisely represent a specific instance. In this work, we present SAM3-I, an enhanced framework that unifies concept-level understanding and instruction-level reasoning within the SAM family. SAM3-I introduces an instruction-aware cascaded adaptation mechanism that progressively aligns expressive instruction semantics with SAM3's existing vision-language representations, enabling direct instruction-following segmentation without sacrificing its original concept-driven capabilities. Furthermore, we design a structured instruction taxonomy spanning concept, simple, and complex levels, and develop a scalable data engine to construct a dataset with diverse instruction-mask pairs. Experiments show that SAM3-I delivers appealing performance, demonstrating that SAM3 can be effectively extended to follow natural-language instructions while preserving its strong concept grounding.

The STEN employs intensity-aware multi-head cross-attention to adaptively enhance important regions for both template and search branches. The DSFAM enhances multi-scale UAV target features by integrating local details with global features, utilizing spatial attention guidance within the search frame. The DCFAM effectively integrates the mixed template generated from STEN in the template branch and original template, avoiding excessive background interference with the template and thereby enhancing the emphasis on UAV target region features within the search frame. Furthermore, to enhance the feature extraction capabilities of the network for IRUT without adding extra computational burden, we propose a novel tracking-specific target-aware contextual attention knowledge distiller. It transfers the target prior from the teacher network to the student model, significantly improving the student network's focus on informative regions at each hierarchical level of the backbone network. Extensive experiments on real infrared UAV datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art target trackers under complex backgrounds while achieving a real-time tracking speed."

Such privately adapted LLMs are regarded as either personal privacy assets or corporate intellectual property. Therefore, protecting model weights and maintaining strict confidentiality during deployment and distribution have become critically important. However, existing model formats and deployment frameworks provide little to no built-in support for confidentiality, access control, or secure integration with trusted hardware. Current methods for securing model deployment either rely on computationally expensive cryptographic techniques or tightly controlled private infrastructure. Although these approaches can be effective in specific scenarios, they are difficult and costly for widespread deployment.\n  In this paper, we introduce CryptoTensors, a secure and format-compatible file structure for confidential LLM distribution. Built as an extension to the widely adopted Safetensors format, CryptoTensors incorporates tensor-level encryption and embedded access control policies, while preserving critical features such as lazy loading and partial deserialization. It enables transparent decryption and automated key management, supporting flexible licensing and secure model execution with minimal overhead. We implement a proof-of-concept library, benchmark its performance across serialization and runtime scenarios, and validate its compatibility with existing inference frameworks, including Hugging Face Transformers and vLLM. Our results highlight CryptoTensors as a light-weight, efficient, and developer-friendly solution for safeguarding LLM weights in real-world and widespread deployments."

MPPI has been widely applied as a GPU-accelerated random search method to deterministic direct single-shooting optimal control problems arising in model predictive control (MPC) formulations. MPPI offers several key advantages, including flexibility, robustness, ease of implementation, and inherent parallelizability. However, its performance can deteriorate in high-dimensional settings since the optimal control problem is solved via Monte Carlo sampling. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an enhanced MPPI method that incorporates a Jacobian reconstruction technique and the second-order Generalized Gauss-Newton method. This novel approach is called \\textit{Gauss-Newton accelerated MPPI}. The numerical results show that the Gauss-Newton accelerated MPPI approach substantially improves MPPI scalability and computational efficiency while preserving the key benefits of the classical MPPI framework, making it a promising approach even for high-dimensional problems."

However, obtaining a complete multi-phase series is often clinically unfeasible due to radiation concerns or scanning limitations, leading to the \"missing modality\" problem. Existing deep learning approaches typically treat missing phases as absent independent channels, ignoring the inherent temporal continuity of hemodynamics. In this work, we propose Time Attenuated Representation Disentanglement (TARDis), a novel physics-aware framework that redefines missing modalities as missing sample points on a continuous Time-Attenuation Curve. TARDis explicitly disentangles the latent feature space into a time-invariant static component (anatomy) and a time-dependent dynamic component (perfusion). We achieve this via a dual-path architecture: a quantization-based path using a learnable embedding dictionary to extract consistent anatomical structures, and a probabilistic path using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder to model dynamic enhancement conditioned on the estimated scan time. This design allows the network to hallucinate missing hemodynamic features by sampling from the learned latent distribution. Extensive experiments on a large-scale private abdominal CT dataset (2,282 cases) and two public datasets demonstrate that TARDis significantly outperforms state-of-the-art incomplete modality frameworks. Notably, our method maintains robust diagnostic performance even in extreme data-sparsity scenarios, highlighting its potential for reducing radiation exposure while maintaining diagnostic precision."

Temp-SCONE introduces a confidence-driven regularization loss based on Average Thresholded Confidence (ATC), penalizing instability in predictions across time steps while preserving SCONE's energy-margin separation. Experiments on dynamic datasets demonstrate that Temp-SCONE significantly improves robustness under temporal drift, yielding higher corrupted-data accuracy and more reliable OOD detection compared to SCONE. On distinct datasets without temporal continuity, Temp-SCONE maintains comparable performance, highlighting the importance and limitations of temporal regularization. Our theoretical insights on temporal stability and generalization error further establish Temp-SCONE as a step toward reliable OWL in evolving dynamic environments."

We use a mask segmentation neural network to identify visible parts, followed by retrieving labeled template meshes. These meshes undergo pose optimization to determine the most suitable template. Then, we propose to simplify the parts of the transformed template mesh to primitive shapes like cuboids or cylinders. Finally, we design a search algorithm to find correspondences in the scene based on local and global proportions. We develop baselines for comparison that consider all possible combinations, and choose the highest scoring combination for common metrics used in foreground maps and mask accuracy. Our approach achieves comparable results to the baselines for two different scenes, and we show qualitative results for an implementation in a real-world scenario."

The standard approach for data-agnostic uncertainty quantification is to use conformal prediction (CP), a well-established framework to build uncertainty models with proven statistical guarantees that do not assume any shape for the error distribution of the surrogate model. However, since the classic statistical guarantee offered by CP is given in terms of bounds for the marginal coverage, for small calibration set sizes (which are frequent in realistic surrogate modelling that aims to quantify error at different regions), the potentially strong dispersion of the coverage distribution around its average negatively impacts the reliability of the uncertainty model, often obtaining coverages below the expected value, resulting in a less applicable framework. After providing a gentle presentation of uncertainty quantification for surrogate models for machine learning practitioners, in this paper we bridge the gap by proposing a new statistical guarantee that offers probabilistic information for the coverage of a single conformal predictor. We show that the proposed framework converges to the standard solution offered by CP for large calibration set sizes and, unlike the classic guarantee, still offers reliable information about the coverage of a conformal predictor for small data sizes. We illustrate and validate the methodology in a suite of examples, and implement an open access software solution that can be used alongside common conformal prediction libraries to obtain uncertainty models that fulfil the new guarantee."

The development and validation of those DL models relies heavily on the availability of high-quality, large-scale datasets.

This review provides a comprehensive guide to the critical steps in dataset creation, including: 1) image acquisition, 2) selection of annotation software, and 3) annotation creation. In addition to ensuring a sufficiently large number of images, it is crucial to address sources of image variability (domain shifts) - such as those related to slide preparation and digitization - that could lead to algorithmic errors if not adequately represented in the training data. Key quality criteria for annotations are the three \"C\"s: correctness, completeness, and consistency. This review explores methods to enhance annotation quality through the use of advanced techniques that mitigate the limitations of single annotators. To support dataset creators, a standard operating procedure (SOP) is provided as supplemental material, outlining best practices for dataset development. Furthermore, the article underscores the importance of open datasets in driving innovation and enhancing reproducibility of DL research.

SQDF is further enhanced with three innovations: a discount factor for proper credit assignment in the denoising process, the integration of consistency models to refine Q-function estimates, and the use of an off-policy replay buffer to improve mode coverage and manage the reward-diversity trade-off. Our experiments demonstrate that SQDF achieves superior target rewards while preserving diversity in text-to-image alignment.

To move closer to the optimal frontier, we study reward-filtered sequential inference, a simple procedure that selectively incorporates only high-reward generations into the context. This mechanism concentrates computation on superior policy candidates and suppresses inferior ones. On the theoretical side, we show that reward-filtered sequential inference yields strictly stronger guarantees than standard TTC paradigms. On the empirical side, we evaluate such an inference strategy across diverse benchmarks and observe consistent improvements over widely used approaches, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of our framework."

Our ablation study confirms the enhanced robustness of our RM, as evidenced by its strong cross-lingual generalization.

However, progress in both Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and world models is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse training data. A promising solution is to \"robotize\" web-scale human videos, which has been proven effective for policy training. However, these solutions mainly \"overlay\" robot arms to egocentric videos, which cannot handle complex full-body motions and scene occlusions in third-person videos, making them unsuitable for robotizing humans. To bridge this gap, we introduce X-Humanoid, a generative video editing approach that adapts the powerful Wan 2.2 model into a video-to-video structure and finetunes it for the human-to-humanoid translation task. This finetuning requires paired human-humanoid videos, so we designed a scalable data creation pipeline, turning community assets into 17+ hours of paired synthetic videos using Unreal Engine. We then apply our trained model to 60 hours of the Ego-Exo4D videos, generating and releasing a new large-scale dataset of over 3.6 million \"robotized\" humanoid video frames. Quantitative analysis and user studies confirm our method's superiority over existing baselines: 69% of users rated it best for motion consistency, and 62.1% for embodiment correctness."

These features are dynamically fused with adaptive prioritization to enhance classification performance. Additionally, we introduce a curated dataset comprising 3,542 video segments derived from 202 individuals to support training and evaluation.

However, training these agents through direct, continuous interaction with diverse tools is often prohibitively expensive, slow, and introduces additional development and maintenance overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce the Generalist Tool Model (GTM), a 1.5-billion-parameter model that learns to act as a universal tool simulator. With only prompt-level configuration, GTM accesses tool functionalities along with input arguments and generates outputs that faithfully mimic real tool execution, providing a fast and cost-effective solution that eliminates development overhead. To build GTM, we propose the Context-Aware Response Generation (CARG) pipeline, which synthesizes comprehensive training data covering over 20,000 tools across 300 domains including physics, medicine, robotics, and finance. Through this pipeline, GTM learns to produce not only syntactically correct outputs but also logically coherent and contextually appropriate responses. Experiments demonstrate that GTM produces high-quality outputs with strong consistency and reliability. Besides when used in real reinforcement learning scenarios for agent training, GTM exhibits significantly faster simulation speed compared to real tools while maintaining comparable output quality, along with remarkable generalization and domain adaptability. Our results establish GTM as a foundational component for developing future AI agents, enabling efficient and scalable training of tool-augmented systems."

In this paper, we introduce a new task, Object Retexture, which transfers local textures from a reference object to a target object in images or videos. To perform this task, a straightforward solution is to use ControlNet conditioned on the source structure and the reference texture. However, this approach suffers from limited controllability for two reasons: conditioning on the raw reference image introduces unwanted structural information, and it fails to disentangle the visual texture and structure information of the source. To address this problem, we propose Refaçade, a method that consists of two key designs to achieve precise and controllable texture transfer in both images and videos. First, we employ a texture remover trained on paired textured/untextured 3D mesh renderings to remove appearance information while preserving the geometry and motion of source videos. Second, we disrupt the reference global layout using a jigsaw permutation, encouraging the model to focus on local texture statistics rather than the global layout of the object. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior visual quality, precise editing, and controllability, outperforming strong baselines in both quantitative and human evaluations.

However, they often fail in scenarios requiring a deeper understanding of physical dynamics. This limitation primarily arises from their reliance on appearance-based matching. Incorporating physical motion modeling is crucial for deeper video understanding, but presents three key challenges: (1) motion signals are often entangled with appearance variations, making it difficult to extract clean physical cues; (2) effective motion modeling requires not only continuous-time motion representations but also capturing physical dynamics; and (3) collecting accurate annotations for physical attributes is costly and often impractical. To address these issues, we propose PhyVLLM, a physical-guided video-language framework that explicitly incorporates physical motion into Video LLMs. Specifically, PhyVLLM disentangles visual appearance and object motion through a dual-branch encoder. To model physical dynamics over time, we incorporate a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) module, which generates differentiable physical dynamic representations. The resulting motion-aware representations are projected into the token space of a pretrained LLM, enabling physics reasoning without compromising the model's original multimodal capabilities. To circumvent the need for explicit physical labels, PhyVLLM employs a self-supervised manner to model the continuous evolution of object motion. Experimental results demonstrate that PhyVLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Video LLMs on both physical reasoning and general video understanding tasks, highlighting the advantages of incorporating explicit physical modeling."

While previous work has explored model-level and instance-level explainable graph learning, there has been limited investigation into explainable graph representation learning. In this paper, we focus on representation-level explainable graph learning and ask a fundamental question: What specific information about a graph is captured in graph representations? Our approach is inspired by graph kernels, which evaluate graph similarities by counting substructures within specific graph patterns. Although the pattern counting vector can serve as an explainable representation, it has limitations such as ignoring node features and being high-dimensional. To address these limitations, we introduce a framework (PXGL-GNN) for learning and explaining graph representations through graph pattern analysis. We start by sampling graph substructures of various patterns. Then, we learn the representations of these patterns and combine them using a weighted sum, where the weights indicate the importance of each graph pattern's contribution. We also provide theoretical analyses of our methods, including robustness and generalization. In our experiments, we show how to learn and explain graph representations for real-world data using pattern analysis. Additionally, we compare our method against multiple baselines in both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks to demonstrate its effectiveness."

However, existing methods encounter several fundamental limitations: 1) neglecting class-level semantic alignment and excessively pursuing pair-wise sample alignment; 2) lacking either pseudo-label reliability consideration or geometric guidance for assessing label correctness; 3) directly quantizing original features affected by domain shift, undermining the quality of learned hash codes. In view of these limitations, we propose Prototype-Based Semantic Consistency Alignment (PSCA), a two-stage framework for effective domain adaptive retrieval. In the first stage, a set of orthogonal prototypes directly establishes class-level semantic connections, maximizing inter-class separability while gathering intra-class samples. During the prototype learning, geometric proximity provides a reliability indicator for semantic consistency alignment through adaptive weighting of pseudo-label confidences. The resulting membership matrix and prototypes facilitate feature reconstruction, ensuring quantization on reconstructed rather than original features, thereby improving subsequent hash coding quality and seamlessly connecting both stages. In the second stage, domain-specific quantization functions process the reconstructed features under mutual approximation constraints, generating unified binary hash codes across domains. Extensive experiments validate PSCA's superior performance across multiple datasets."

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Identity Clue Refinement and Enhancement (ICRE) network to mine and utilize the implicit discriminative knowledge inherent in modality-specific attributes. Initially, we design a Multi-Perception Feature Refinement (MPFR) module that aggregates shallow features from shared branches, aiming to capture modality-specific attributes that are easily overlooked. Then, we propose a Semantic Distillation Cascade Enhancement (SDCE) module, which distills identity-aware knowledge from the aggregated shallow features and guide the learning of modality-invariant features. Finally, an Identity Clues Guided (ICG) Loss is proposed to alleviate the modality discrepancies within the enhanced features and promote the learning of a diverse representation space. Extensive experiments across multiple public datasets clearly show that our proposed ICRE outperforms existing SOTA methods."

Among various types of sensing media, WiFi signals offer advantages such as widespread availability, low hardware cost, and strong robustness to environmental conditions like light, temperature, and humidity. By analyzing Wi-Fi signals in the environment, it is possible to capture dynamic changes of the human body and accomplish sensing applications such as gesture recognition. Although many existing gesture sensing solutions perform well in-domain but lack cross-domain capabilities (i.e., recognition performance in untrained environments). To address this, we extract Doppler spectra from the channel state information (CSI) received by all receivers and concatenate each Doppler spectrum along the same time axis to generate fused images with multi-angle information as input features. Furthermore, inspired by the convolutional block attention module (CBAM), we propose a gesture recognition network that integrates a multi-semantic spatial attention mechanism with a self-attention-based channel mechanism. This network constructs attention maps to quantify the spatiotemporal features of gestures in images, enabling the extraction of key domain-independent features. Additionally, ResNet18 is employed as the backbone network to further capture deep-level features. To validate the network performance, we evaluate the proposed network on the public Widar3 dataset, and the results show that it not only maintains high in-domain accuracy of 99.72%, but also achieves high performance in cross-domain recognition of 97.61%, significantly outperforming existing best solutions."

Current approaches to adapting pretrained models, including full-parameter and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, still rely heavily on task-specific training on downstream tasks. Therefore, zero-shot segmentation has gained increasing attention, especially with foundation models such as SAM demonstrating promising generalization capabilities. However, SAM still faces notable limitations on medical datasets due to domain shifts, making efficient zero-shot enhancement an urgent research goal. To address these challenges, we propose BA-TTA-SAM, a task-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that significantly enhances the zero-shot segmentation performance of SAM via test-time adaptation. This framework integrates two key mechanisms: (1) The encoder-level Gaussian prompt injection embeds Gaussian-based prompts directly into the image encoder, providing explicit guidance for initial representation learning. (2) The cross-layer boundary-aware attention alignment exploits the hierarchical feature interactions within the ViT backbone, aligning deep semantic responses with shallow boundary cues. Experiments on four datasets, including ISIC, Kvasir, BUSI, and REFUGE, show an average improvement of 12.4\\% in the DICE score compared with SAM's zero-shot segmentation performance. The results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in medical image segmentation. Our framework significantly enhances the generalization ability of SAM, without requiring any source-domain training data. Extensive experiments on publicly available medical datasets strongly demonstrate the superiority of our framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/Emilychenlin/BA-TTA-SAM."

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer strong semantic priors and cross-modal generalization, while world models (WMs) provide actionable latent dynamics for prediction and control. Their combination holds promise for open-ended embodied intelligence, yet introduces two key challenges: (1) establishing a tight coupling between the semantic intent from MLLMs and the dynamic state representations within the WM's latent space, and (2) achieving task-aware adaptability that supports multi-task learning and cross-environment generalization. To address these limitations, we propose BiTAgent, a task-aware dynamic joint framework that enables bidirectional coupling between MLLMs and WMs. BiTAgent establishes two complementary pathways: a forward path that injects MLLM representations into the WM's latent space for semantically guided imagination, and a backward path where WM-generated feedback refines the MLLM's semantic space via dense text-conditioned rewards. This bidirectional interaction is realized through three synergistic components: Task-Aware Dynamic Joint Learning, Task-Aware Behavior Learning, and MLLM-WM Joint Optimization, which together harmonize semantic reasoning and dynamic prediction. Extensive experiments across multi-task and cross-environment settings demonstrate superior stability and generalization over state-of-the-art baselines, marking a step toward open-ended embodied learning."

However, due to the distinct characteristics of infrared images, existing foundation models such as Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained on visible data perform suboptimal in infrared image interpretation tasks. To bridge this gap, an infrared foundation model known as InfMAE was developed and pre-trained on large-scale infrared datasets. Despite its effectiveness, InfMAE still faces several limitations, including the omission of informative tokens, insufficient modeling of global associations, and neglect of non-uniform noise. In this paper, we propose a Dual-domain Guided Infrared foundation model based on MAE (DuGI-MAE). First, we design a deterministic masking strategy based on token entropy, preserving only high-entropy tokens for reconstruction to enhance informativeness. Next, we introduce a Dual-Domain Guidance (DDG) module, which simultaneously captures global token relationships and adaptively filters non-uniform background noise commonly present in infrared imagery. To facilitate large-scale pretraining, we construct Inf-590K, a comprehensive infrared image dataset encompassing diverse scenes, various target types, and multiple spatial resolutions. Pretrained on Inf-590K, DuGI-MAE demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across various downstream tasks, including infrared object detection, semantic segmentation, and small target detection. Experimental results validate the superiority of the proposed method over both supervised and self-supervised comparison methods. Our code is available in the supplementary material."

In this work, we present UltraImage, a principled framework that addresses both issues. Through frequency-wise analysis of positional embeddings, we identify that repetition arises from the periodicity of the dominant frequency, whose period aligns with the training resolution. We introduce a recursive dominant frequency correction to constrain it within a single period after extrapolation. Furthermore, we find that quality degradation stems from diluted attention and thus propose entropy-guided adaptive attention concentration, which assigns higher focus factors to sharpen local attention for fine detail and lower ones to global attention patterns to preserve structural consistency. Experiments show that UltraImage consistently outperforms prior methods on Qwen-Image and Flux (around 4K) across three generation scenarios, reducing repetition and improving visual fidelity. Moreover, UltraImage can generate images up to 6K*6K without low-resolution guidance from a training resolution of 1328p, demonstrating its extreme extrapolation capability.

This paper introduces a constrained ensemble control framework for parameterized, heterogeneous robotic systems operating under state and environmental constraints, such as obstacle avoidance. We develop a moment kernel transform that maps the parameterized ensemble dynamics to the moment system in a kernel space, enabling the characterization of population-level behavior. The state-space constraints, such as polyhedral waypoints to be visited and obstacles to be avoided, are also transformed into the moment space, leading to a unified formulation for safe, large-scale ensemble control. Expressive signal temporal logic specifications are employed to encode complex visit-avoid tasks, which are achieved through a single shared controller synthesized from our constrained ensemble control formulation. Simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in safely and efficiently controlling robotic ensembles within constrained environments."

Task-oriented diffusion models have significantly advanced action-to-motion, text-to-motion, and audio-to-motion applications. In this paper, we investigate fundamental questions regarding motion representations and loss functions in a controlled study, and we enumerate the impacts of various decisions in the workflow of the generative motion diffusion model. To answer these questions, we conduct empirical studies based on a proxy motion diffusion model (MDM). We apply v loss as the prediction objective on MDM (vMDM), where v is the weighted sum of motion data and noise. We aim to enhance the understanding of latent data distributions and provide a foundation for improving the state of conditional motion diffusion models. First, we evaluate the six common motion representations in the literature and compare their performance in terms of quality and diversity metrics. Second, we compare the training time under various configurations to shed light on how to speed up the training process of motion diffusion models. Finally, we also conduct evaluation analysis on a large motion dataset. The results of our experiments indicate clear performance differences across motion representations in diverse datasets. Our results also demonstrate the impacts of distinct configurations on model training and suggest the importance and effectiveness of these decisions on the outcomes of motion diffusion models."

Although there exist considerable methods that focus on local information from convolutional neural network models or global information from transformer models, the single-type model falls into a modeling dilemma between local fine-grained details and global long-range dependencies, thus deteriorating for specular highlights with different scales. Therefore, to accommodate specular highlights of all scales, we propose a multi-model architecture for specular highlight removal (MM-SHR) that effectively captures fine-grained features in highlight regions and models long-range dependencies between highlight and highlight-free areas. Specifically, we employ convolution operations to extract local details in the shallow layers of MM-SHR, and utilize the attention mechanism to capture global features in the deep layers, ensuring both operation efficiency and removal accuracy. To model long-range dependencies without compromising computational complexity, we utilize a coarse-to-fine manner and propose Omni-Directional Attention Integration Block(OAIBlock) and Adaptive Region-Aware Hybrid-Domain Dual Attention Convolutional Network(HDDAConv) , which leverage omni-directiona pixel-shifting and window-dividing operations at the raw features to achieve specular highlight removal. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark tasks and six types of surface materials demonstrate that MM-SHR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency for specular highlight removal. The implementation will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Htcicv/MM-SHR."

Our efficient Transformer-based conditional VAE allows for precise, interactive control over arbitrary user-specified joints for tasks like goal-reaching and in-betweening from a single model. To ensure long-term temporal stability, we introduce a novel reference-guided feedback mechanism that prevents error accumulation. This mechanism also serves as a plug-and-play stylization module, enabling real-time style transfer. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that COMET robustly generates high-quality motion at real-time speeds, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in complex motion control tasks and confirming its readiness for demanding interactive applications."

Zero-shot, identity-preserving models such as Insert Anything and OminiControl now support applications like virtual try-on without requiring additional fine-tuning. While these models may be fitting for humans and rigid everyday objects, they still have limitations for non-rigid or fine-grained categories. These domains often lack accessible, high-quality data -- especially videos or multi-view observations of the same subject -- making them difficult both to evaluate and to improve upon. Yet, such domains are essential for moving beyond content creation toward applications that demand accuracy and fine detail. Birds are an excellent domain for this task: they exhibit high diversity, require fine-grained cues for identification, and come in a wide variety of poses. We introduce the NABirds Look-Alikes (NABLA) dataset, consisting of 4,759 expert-curated image pairs. Together with 1,073 pairs collected from multi-image observations on iNaturalist and a small set of videos, this forms a benchmark for evaluating identity-preserving generation of birds. We show that state-of-the-art baselines fail to maintain identity on this dataset, and we demonstrate that training on images grouped by species, age, and sex -- used as a proxy for identity -- substantially improves performance on both seen and unseen species."

To address the gradient conflicts introduced by the heterogeneous supervision, we further propose the Symmetric Alignment-Conflict Projection (SACP) module that proactively reformulates gradients by suppressing the components along conflicting directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeRA outperforms LARP, the previous state-of-the-art video tokenizer by 25% on UCF-101 in terms of rFVD.

This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic based Decision Support System (DSS) designed for real time, prescriptive game management. Unlike traditional Machine Learning approaches that encounter a predictive ceiling by attempting to replicate human behavior, our system audits performance through an objective, rule based inference engine. We propose a methodological advancement by reformulating the PlayeRank metric into a Cumulative Mean with Role Aware Normalization, eliminating the play time exposure bias inherent in cumulative sum models to enable accurate intra match comparison. The system integrates this refined metric with physiological proxies (fatigue) and contextual variables (disciplinary risk modulated by tactical role) to calculate a dynamic Substitution Priority (P final). Validation via a case study of the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Brazil and Belgium demonstrates the system's ecological validity: it not only aligned with expert consensus on executed substitutions (for example Gabriel Jesus) but, crucially, identified high risk scenarios ignored by human decision makers. Specifically, the model flagged the \"FAGNER Paradox\" - a maximum priority defensive risk - minutes before a critical yellow card, and detected the \"Lukaku Paradox\", where an isolated assist masked a severe drop in participation. These results confirm that Fuzzy Logic offers a transparent, explainable, and superior alternative to black box models for optimizing real time tactical decisions."

In this case, weights must be offloaded to external memory, and fetching them incurs costly and repeated transfers. We address this by adopting CXL-attached near-data processing (CXL-NDP) as the offloading tier to execute cold experts in place, converting expensive parameter movement into cheaper activation movement. Unlike prior GPU-NDP systems that are largely context-agnostic and reactive, we develop a context-aware MoE system that uses prefill-stage activation statistics to guide decoding-stage expert placement, dynamically pins hot experts in GPU-side HBM, and maps the remainder to CXL-NDP. To meet NDP's limited compute throughput, we introduce context-aware mixed-precision quantization that allocates per-expert bitwidths (1-4 bit) based on prefill stage. The resulting MoE inference system overlaps GPU and NDP execution while minimizing cross-device movement. The evaluation on the GPU-NDP system shows that our approach achieves up to an 8.7-fold decoding throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art method, while incurring only a 0.13% average accuracy drop."

Testing 1,785 coins graded by experts, the ANN nailed 86% exact matches and hit 98% when allowing a 3-grade leeway. On the flip side, CNN and SVM mostly just guessed the most common grade, scraping by with 31% and 30% exact hits. Sure, the CNN looked good on broader tolerance metrics, but that is because of some averaging trick in regression that hides how it totally flops at picking out specific grades. All told, when you are stuck with under 2,000 examples and lopsided classes, baking in real coin-expert knowledge through feature design beats out those inscrutable, all-in-one deep learning setups.

However, existing methods typically require specialized models tailored to different tasks, lacking unified modeling of spatiotemporal features across multiple time series tasks. In this paper, we propose a Unified Time Series Generative Model (UniTS), a general framework applicable to various time series tasks, including time series reconstruction, time series cloud removal, time series semantic change detection, and time series forecasting. Based on the flow matching generative paradigm, UniTS constructs a deterministic evolution path from noise to targets under the guidance of task-specific conditions, achieving unified modeling of spatiotemporal representations for multiple tasks. The UniTS architecture consists of a diffusion transformer with spatio-temporal blocks, where we design an Adaptive Condition Injector (ACor) to enhance the model's conditional perception of multimodal inputs, enabling high-quality controllable generation. Additionally, we design a Spatiotemporal-aware Modulator (STM) to improve the ability of spatio-temporal blocks to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we construct two high-quality multimodal time series datasets, TS-S12 and TS-S12CR, filling the gap of benchmark datasets for time series cloud removal and forecasting tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniTS exhibits exceptional generative and cognitive capabilities in both low-level and high-level time series tasks. It significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly when facing challenges such as severe cloud contamination, modality absence, and forecasting phenological variations."

A dominant research trend seeks to enhance end-to-end (E2E) driving systems by integrating vision-language models (VLMs), leveraging their rich world knowledge and reasoning abilities to improve generalization across diverse environments. However, most existing VLMs or vision-language agents (VLAs) are built upon autoregressive (AR) models. In this paper, we observe that existing AR-based VLMs -- limited by causal attention and sequential token generation -- often fail to maintain consistency and controllability between high-level reasoning and low-level planning. In contrast, recent discrete diffusion VLMs equipped with bidirectional attention exhibit superior controllability and reliability through iterative denoising. Building on these observations, we introduce dVLM-AD, a diffusion-based vision-language model that unifies perception, structured reasoning, and low-level planning for end-to-end driving. Evaluated on nuScenes and WOD-E2E, dVLM-AD yields more consistent reasoning-action pairs and achieves planning performance comparable to existing driving VLM/VLA systems despite a modest backbone, outperforming AR-based baselines with a 9 percent improvement in behavior-trajectory consistency and a 6 percent increase in RFS on long-tail WOD-E2E scenarios.

In this paper, to mitigate the prerequisites, we propose a Single-Pair Guided Diffusion for generalized noise synthesis GuidNoise, which uses a single noisy/clean pair as the guidance, often easily obtained by itself within a training set. To train GuidNoise, which generates synthetic noisy images from the guidance, we introduce a guidance-aware affine feature modification (GAFM) and a noise-aware refine loss to leverage the inherent potential of diffusion models. This loss function refines the diffusion model's backward process, making the model more adept at generating realistic noise distributions. The GuidNoise synthesizes high-quality noisy images under diverse noise environments without additional metadata during both training and inference. Additionally, GuidNoise enables the efficient generation of noisy-clean image pairs at inference time, making synthetic noise readily applicable for augmenting training data. This self-augmentation significantly improves denoising performance, especially in practical scenarios with lightweight models and limited training data.

BALI combines language and action cues from the human, asks clarifying questions only when the expected information gain from the answer outweighs the cost of interruption, and selects supportive actions that align with inferred goals. We evaluate the approach in collaborative cooking tasks, where goals may be novel to the robot and unbounded.

NORi stands for neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) Richardson number (Ri) closure. The physical parameterization is controlled by a Richardson number-dependent diffusivity and viscosity. The NODEs are trained to capture the entrainment through the base of the boundary layer, which cannot be represented with a local diffusive closure. The parameterization is trained using large-eddy simulations in an \"a posteriori\" fashion, where parameters are calibrated with a loss function that explicitly depends on the actual time-integrated variables of interest rather than the instantaneous subgrid fluxes, which are inherently noisy. NORi is designed for the realistic nonlinear equation of state of seawater and demonstrates excellent prediction and generalization capabilities in capturing entrainment dynamics under different convective strengths, oceanic background stratifications, rotation strengths, and surface wind forcings. NORi is numerically stable for at least 100 years of integration time in large-scale simulations, despite only being trained on 2-day horizons, and can be run with time steps as long as one hour. The highly expressive neural networks, combined with a physically-rigorous base closure, prove to be a robust paradigm for designing parameterizations for climate models where data requirements are drastically reduced, inference performance can be directly targeted and optimized, and numerical stability is implicitly encouraged during training."

To facilitate progress in this direction, we introduce StreamEQA, the first benchmark designed for streaming video question answering in embodied scenarios. StreamEQA evaluates existing MLLMs along two orthogonal dimensions: Embodied and Streaming. Along the embodied dimension, we categorize the questions into three levels: perception, interaction, and planning, which progressively assess a model's ability to recognize fine-grained visual details, reason about agent-object interactions, and perform high-level goal-directed reasoning. For the streaming dimension, questions are divided into backward, real-time, and forward reasoning, with each mode relying on a distinct temporal context. Built upon 156 independent long videos, StreamEQA defines 42 tasks and generates approximately 21K question-answer pairs with precise timestamps through a hybrid pipeline combining automated generation and human refinement. Evaluations of 13 state-of-the-art video-LLMs reveal that, despite strong performance on conventional benchmarks, these models still struggle with streaming video understanding in embodied scenarios. We hope StreamEQA will catalyze research on streaming video understanding for embodied applications."

      "summary": "Automating disassembly of critical components from end-of-life (EoL) desktops, such as high-value items like RAM modules and CPUs, as well as sensitive parts like hard disk drives, remains challenging due to the inherent variability and uncertainty of these products. Moreover, their disassembly requires sequential, precise, and dexterous operations, further increasing the complexity of automation. Current robotic disassembly processes are typically divided into several stages: perception, sequence planning, task planning, motion planning, and manipulation. Each stage requires explicit modeling, which limits generalization to unfamiliar scenarios. Recent development of vision-language-action (VLA) models has presented an end-to-end approach for general robotic manipulation tasks. Although VLAs have demonstrated promising performance on simple tasks, the feasibility of applying such models to complex disassembly remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we collected a customized dataset for robotic RAM and CPU disassembly and used it to fine-tune two well-established VLA approaches, OpenVLA and OpenVLA-OFT, as a case study. We divided the whole disassembly task into several small steps, and our preliminary experimental results indicate that the fine-tuned VLA models can faithfully complete multiple early steps but struggle with certain critical subtasks, leading to task failure. However, we observed that a simple hybrid strategy that combines VLA with a rule-based controller can successfully perform the entire disassembly operation. These findings highlight the current limitations of VLA models in handling the dexterity and precision required for robotic EoL product disassembly. By offering a detailed analysis of the observed results, this study provides insights that may inform future research to address current challenges and advance end-to-end robotic automated disassembly."

While prior agentic systems can execute isolated instructions, they struggle with automating multi-step, session-level workflows due to limited control over the operational process. To this end, we introduce AutoDW, a novel execution framework that enables stepwise, rollback-enabled operation orchestration. AutoDW incrementally plans API actions conditioned on user instructions, intent-filtered API candidates, and the evolving states of the document. It further employs robust rollback mechanisms at both the argument and API levels, enabling dynamic correction and fault tolerance. These designs together ensure that the execution trajectory of AutoDW remains aligned with user intent and document context across long-horizon workflows. To assess its effectiveness, we construct a comprehensive benchmark of 250 sessions and 1,708 human-annotated instructions, reflecting realistic document processing scenarios with interdependent instructions. AutoDW achieves 90% and 62% completion rates on instruction- and session-level tasks, respectively, outperforming strong baselines by 40% and 76%. Moreover, AutoDW also remains robust for the decision of backbone LLMs and on tasks with varying difficulty. Code and data will be open-sourced. Code: https://github.com/YJett/AutoDW"

The demand for both automated approaches and deep integration of human insight makes this a challenging problem. We address this gap by proposing an approach to synthesise a FM task-specific evaluator program that provides automation and a custom UI for capturing feedback. The core novelty of our approach lies in: (1) a task-agnostic meta-model that captures properties of any FM task, (2) an interaction protocol for efficient use of human feedback, and (3) an eval synthesiser that selects or generates an appropriate set of evals. We implement our approach in \\toolname and demonstrate the concept on two diverse FM tasks: chart data extraction and document question answering.

Existing studies mainly follow two directions: trajectory generation oriented, which focuses on producing high-quality trajectories with simple decision mechanisms, and trajectory selection oriented, which performs multi-dimensional evaluation to select the best trajectory yet lacks sufficient generative capability. In this work, we propose MindDrive, a harmonized framework that integrates high-quality trajectory generation with comprehensive decision reasoning. It establishes a structured reasoning paradigm of \"context simulation - candidate generation - multi-objective trade-off\". In particular, the proposed Future-aware Trajectory Generator (FaTG), based on a World Action Model (WaM), performs ego-conditioned \"what-if\" simulations to predict potential future scenes and generate foresighted trajectory candidates. Building upon this, the VLM-oriented Evaluator (VLoE) leverages the reasoning capability of a large vision-language model to conduct multi-objective evaluations across safety, comfort, and efficiency dimensions, leading to reasoned and human-aligned decision making. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM-v1 and NAVSIM-v2 benchmarks demonstrate that MindDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance across multi-dimensional driving metrics, significantly enhancing safety, compliance, and generalization.

Currently, most existing automatic trailer generation methods employ a \"selection-then-ranking\" paradigm (i.e., first selecting key shots and then ranking them), which suffers from inevitable error propagation and limits the quality of the generated trailers. Beyond this paradigm, we propose a new self-paced and self-corrective masked prediction method called SSMP, which achieves state-of-the-art results in automatic trailer generation via bi-directional contextual modeling and progressive self-correction. In particular, SSMP trains a Transformer encoder that takes the movie shot sequences as prompts and generates corresponding trailer shot sequences accordingly. The model is trained via masked prediction, reconstructing each trailer shot sequence from its randomly masked counterpart. The mask ratio is self-paced, allowing the task difficulty to adapt to the model and thereby improving model performance. When generating a movie trailer, the model fills the shot positions with high confidence at each step and re-masks the remaining positions for the next prediction, forming a progressive self-correction mechanism that is analogous to how human editors work. Both quantitative results and user studies demonstrate the superiority of SSMP in comparison to existing automatic movie trailer generation methods.

This paper presents an explainable multimodal framework that integrates RGB and Depth (RGB-D) data to recognize Parkinsonian gait patterns under realistic conditions. The proposed system employs dual YOLOv11-based encoders for modality-specific feature extraction, followed by a Multi-Scale Local-Global Extraction (MLGE) module and a Cross-Spatial Neck Fusion mechanism to enhance spatial-temporal representation. This design captures both fine-grained limb motion (e.g., reduced arm swing) and overall gait dynamics (e.g., short stride or turning difficulty), even in challenging scenarios such as low lighting or occlusion caused by clothing. To ensure interpretability, a frozen Large Language Model (LLM) is incorporated to translate fused visual embeddings and structured metadata into clinically meaningful textual explanations. Experimental evaluations on multimodal gait datasets demonstrate that the proposed RGB-D fusion framework achieves higher recognition accuracy, improved robustness to environmental variations, and clear visual-linguistic reasoning compared with single-input baselines. By combining multimodal feature learning with language-based interpretability, this study bridges the gap between visual recognition and clinical understanding, offering a novel vision-language paradigm for reliable and explainable Parkinsons disease gait analysis.

In this work, we propose a differentiable triangle-based ray tracing pipeline that directly treats triangles as rendering primitives without relying on any proxy geometry. Our results show that the proposed method achieves significantly higher rendering quality than existing ray tracing approaches while maintaining real-time rendering performance.

Through rigorous theoretical analysis based on Markov models, we establish that the root cause lies in greedy decoding's inability to escape repetitive loops, exacerbated by self-reinforcement effects.\n  Our comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates three viable solutions: (1) Beam Search decoding with early_stopping=True serves as a universal post-hoc mechanism that effectively resolves all three repetition patterns; (2) presence_penalty hyperparameter provides an effective solution specifically for BadCase 1; and (3) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) fine-tuning offers a universal model-level solution for all three BadCases.\n  The primary value of this work lies in combining first-hand production experience with extensive experimental validation. Our main contributions include systematic theoretical analysis of repetition mechanisms, comprehensive evaluation of multiple solutions with task-specific applicability mapping, identification of early_stopping as the critical parameter for Beam Search effectiveness, and practical production-ready solutions validated in real deployment environments."

To bridge this gap, we introduce GovBench, a benchmark featuring 150 diverse tasks grounded in real-world scenarios, built on data from actual cases. GovBench employs a novel \"reversed-objective\" methodology to synthesize realistic noise and utilizes rigorous metrics to assess end-to-end pipeline reliability. Our analysis on GovBench reveals that current models struggle with complex, multi-step workflows and lack robust error-correction mechanisms. Consequently, we propose DataGovAgent, a framework utilizing a Planner-Executor-Evaluator architecture that integrates constraint-based planning, retrieval-augmented generation, and sandboxed feedback-driven debugging. Experimental results show that DataGovAgent significantly boosts the Average Task Score (ATS) on complex tasks from 39.7 to 54.9 and reduces debugging iterations by over 77.9 percent compared to general-purpose baselines."

Direct testing on real hardware is costly, and building a realistic simulation environment is also challenging. To address these limitations, we introduce RoboBPP, a benchmarking system designed for robotic online bin packing. RoboBPP integrates a physics-based simulator to assess physical feasibility.

However, existing distillation methods often encounter the issue of mixed features in remote sensing images (RSIs), and neglect the discrepancies caused by subtle feature variations, leading to entangled knowledge confusion. To address these challenges, we propose an architecture-agnostic distillation method named Dual-Stream Spectral Decoupling Distillation (DS2D2) for universal remote sensing object detection tasks. Specifically, DS2D2 integrates explicit and implicit distillation grounded in spectral decomposition. Firstly, the first-order wavelet transform is applied for spectral decomposition to preserve the critical spatial characteristics of RSIs. Leveraging this spatial preservation, a Density-Independent Scale Weight (DISW) is designed to address the challenges of dense and small object detection common in RSIs. Secondly, we show implicit knowledge hidden in subtle student-teacher feature discrepancies, which significantly influence predictions when activated by detection heads. This implicit knowledge is extracted via full-frequency and high-frequency amplifiers, which map feature differences to prediction deviations. Extensive experiments on DIOR and DOTA datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, on DIOR dataset, DS2D2 achieves improvements of 4.2% in AP50 for RetinaNet and 3.8% in AP50 for Faster R-CNN, outperforming existing distillation approaches.

To test the framework beyond a single policy, we apply it across general frameworks, sector guidance, and enterprise standards, extracting obligation-bearing clauses and converting them into executable rules. These AI-generated rules closely match strong human baselines on span-level and rule-level metrics, with robust inter-annotator agreement on the gold set. To evaluate downstream behavioral and safety impact, we add HIPAA-derived safeguards to a generative agent and compare it with an otherwise identical agent without guardrails. An LLM-based judge, aligned with gold-standard criteria, measures violation rates and robustness to obfuscated and compositional prompts. Detailed results are provided in the appendix.

Within this vision, Semantic-native communication and agentic intelligence are expected to play central roles.

Agentic intelligence endows distributed RAN entities with goal-driven autonomy, reasoning, planning, and multi-agent collaboration, increasingly supported by foundation models and knowledge graphs. In this work, we first introduce the conceptual foundations of SemCom and agentic networking, and discuss why existing AI-driven O-RAN solutions remain largely bit-centric and task-siloed. We then present a unified taxonomy that organizes recent research along three axes: i) semantic abstraction level (symbol/feature/intent/knowledge), ii) agent autonomy and coordination granularity (single-, multi-, and hierarchical-agent), and iii) RAN control placement across PHY/MAC, near-real-time RIC, and non-real-time RIC. Based on this taxonomy, we systematically introduce enabling technologies including task-oriented semantic encoders/decoders, multi-agent reinforcement learning, foundation-model-assisted RAN agents, and knowledge-graph-based reasoning for cross-layer awareness. Representative 6G use cases, such as immersive XR, vehicular V2X, and industrial digital twins, are analyzed to illustrate the semantic-agentic convergence in practice.

      "summary": "Medical image classification plays an increasingly vital role in identifying various diseases by classifying medical images, such as X-rays, MRIs and CT scans, into different categories based on their features. In recent years, deep learning techniques have attracted significant attention in medical image classification. However, it is usually infeasible to train an entire large deep learning model from scratch. To address this issue, one of the solutions is the transfer learning (TL) technique, where a pre-trained model is reused for a new task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of TL techniques for medical image classification using deep convolutional neural networks. We evaluate six pre-trained models (AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, and InceptionV3) on a custom chest X-ray dataset for disease detection. The experimental results demonstrate that InceptionV3 consistently outperforms other models across all the standard metrics. The ResNet family shows progressively better performance with increasing depth, whereas VGG16 and AlexNet perform reasonably well but with lower accuracy. In addition, we also conduct uncertainty analysis and runtime comparison to assess the robustness and computational efficiency of these models. Our findings reveal that TL is beneficial in most cases, especially with limited data, but the extent of improvement depends on several factors such as model architecture, dataset size, and domain similarity between source and target tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that with a well-trained feature extractor, only a lightweight feedforward model is enough to provide efficient prediction. As such, this study contributes to the understanding of TL in medical image classification, and provides insights for selecting appropriate models based on specific requirements."

      "summary": "Sarcasm is common in online discussions, yet difficult for machines to identify because the intended meaning often contradicts the literal wording. In this work, I study sarcasm detection using only classical machine learning methods and explicit feature engineering, without relying on neural networks or context from parent comments. Using a 100,000-comment subsample of the Self-Annotated Reddit Corpus (SARC 2.0), I combine word-level and character-level TF-IDF features with simple stylistic indicators. Four models are evaluated: logistic regression, a linear SVM, multinomial Naive Bayes, and a random forest. Naive Bayes and logistic regression perform the strongest, achieving F1-scores around 0.57 for sarcastic comments. Although the lack of conversational context limits performance, the results offer a clear and reproducible baseline for sarcasm detection using lightweight and interpretable methods."

      "summary": "Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong few-shot learning capabilities. However, these methods typically learn holistic representations where an image's domain-invariant structure is implicitly entangled with its domain-specific style. This presents an opportunity to further enhance generalization by disentangling these visual cues. In this paper, we propose Fourier-Attentive Representation Learning (FARL), a novel framework that addresses this by explicitly disentangling visual representations using Fourier analysis. The core of our method is a dual cross-attention mechanism, where learnable representation tokens separately query an image's structural features (from the phase spectrum) and stylistic features (from the amplitude spectrum). This process yields enriched, disentangled tokens that are then injected deep into the VLM encoders to guide adaptation. Our design, which includes an asymmetric injection strategy, forces the model to learn a more robust vision-language alignment. Extensive experiments on 15 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

      "summary": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) constructs classifiers using both labelled and unlabelled data. It leverages information from labelled samples, whose acquisition is often costly or labour-intensive, together with unlabelled data to enhance prediction performance. This defines an incomplete-data problem, which statistically can be formulated within the likelihood framework for finite mixture models that can be fitted using the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm. Ideally, one would prefer a completely labelled sample, as one would anticipate that a labelled observation provides more information than an unlabelled one. However, when the mechanism governing label absence depends on the observed features or the class labels or both, the missingness indicators themselves contain useful information. In certain situations, the information gained from modelling the missing-label mechanism can even outweigh the loss due to missing labels, yielding a classifier with a smaller expected error than one based on a completely labelled sample analysed. This improvement arises particularly when class overlap is moderate, labelled data are sparse, and the missingness is informative. Modelling such informative missingness thus offers a coherent statistical framework that unifies likelihood-based inference with the behaviour of empirical SSL methods."

      "summary": "Security of quantum key distribution (QKD) relies on certifying that observed correlations arise from genuine quantum entanglement rather than eavesdropper manipulation. Theoretical security proofs assume idealized conditions, practical certification must contend with adaptive adversaries who optimize their attack strategies against detection systems. Established fundamental adversarial limits for quantum certification using Eve GAN, a generative adversarial network trained to produce classical correlations indistinguishable from quantum. Our central finding: when Eve interpolates her classical correlations with quantum data at mixing parameter, all tested detection methods achieve ROC AUC = 0.50, equivalent to random guessing. This means an eavesdropper needs only 5% classical admixture to completely evade detection. Critically, we discover that same distribution calibration a common practice in prior certification studies inflates detection performance by 44 percentage points compared to proper cross distribution evaluation, revealing a systematic flaw that may have led to overestimated security claims. Analysis of Popescu Rohrlich (PR Box) regime identifies a sharp phase transition at CHSH S = 2.05: below this value, no statistical method distinguishes classical from quantum correlations; above it, detection probability increases monotonically. Hardware validation on IBM Quantum demonstrates that Eve-GAN achieves CHSH = 2.736, remarkably exceeding real quantum hardware performance (CHSH = 2.691), illustrating that classical adversaries can outperform noisy quantum systems on standard certification metrics. These results have immediate implications for QKD security: adversaries maintaining 95% quantum fidelity evade all tested detection methods. We provide corrected methodology using cross-distribution calibration and recommend mandatory adversarial testing for quantum security claims."

We present FMA-Net++, a framework for joint video super-resolution and deblurring that explicitly models this coupled effect of motion and dynamically varying exposure. FMA-Net++ adopts a sequence-level architecture built from Hierarchical Refinement with Bidirectional Propagation blocks, enabling parallel, long-range temporal modeling. Within each block, an Exposure Time-aware Modulation layer conditions features on per-frame exposure, which in turn drives an exposure-aware Flow-Guided Dynamic Filtering module to infer motion- and exposure-aware degradation kernels. FMA-Net++ decouples degradation learning from restoration: the former predicts exposure- and motion-aware priors to guide the latter, improving both accuracy and efficiency. To evaluate under realistic capture conditions, we introduce REDS-ME (multi-exposure) and REDS-RE (random-exposure) benchmarks. Trained solely on synthetic data, FMA-Net++ achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and temporal consistency on our new benchmarks and GoPro, outperforming recent methods in both restoration quality and inference speed, and generalizes well to challenging real-world videos."

We show that, by learning optimal coordination strategies over pools of powerful worker LLMs, a 7B Conductor achieves significant performance gains beyond any individual worker, attaining state-of-the-art results in challenging reasoning benchmarks, such as LiveCodeBench and GPQA. By training with randomized agent pools, our conductor effectively adapts to arbitrary sets of open- and closed-source agents, meeting any user requirements. Furthermore, allowing the Conductor to select itself as a worker gives rise to recursive topologies, elevating performance with a new form of dynamic test-time scaling through online iterative adaptation. More broadly, ours is among the early work demonstrating language model coordination can be unlocked through RL, where powerful coordination strategies emerge naturally in LLMs through pure end-to-end reward maximization."

Addressing this, we introduce the Model-agnostic Saliency Estimation (MASE) framework. MASE offers local explanations for text-based predictive models without necessitating in-depth knowledge of a model's internal architecture. By leveraging Normalized Linear Gaussian Perturbations (NLGP) on the embedding layer instead of raw word inputs, MASE efficiently estimates input saliency. Our results indicate MASE's superiority over other model-agnostic interpretation methods, especially in terms of Delta Accuracy, positioning it as a promising tool for elucidating the operations of text-based models in NLP."

Deploying portable sensors on mobile platforms such as cars and buses offers a low-cost, easy-to-maintain, and wide-coverage data collection solution. However, due to the random and uncontrollable movement patterns of these non-dedicated mobile platforms, the resulting sensor data are often incomplete and temporally inconsistent. By exploring potential training patterns in the reverse process of diffusion models, we propose Spatio-Temporal Physics-Informed Diffusion Models (STeP-Diff). STeP-Diff leverages DeepONet to model the spatial sequence of measurements along with a PDE-informed diffusion model to forecast the spatio-temporal field from incomplete and time-varying data. Through a PDE-constrained regularization framework, the denoising process asymptotically converges to the convection-diffusion dynamics, ensuring that predictions are both grounded in real-world measurements and aligned with the fundamental physics governing pollution dispersion. To assess the performance of the system, we deployed 59 self-designed portable sensing devices in two cities, operating for 14 days to collect air pollution data. Compared to the second-best performing algorithm, our model achieved improvements of up to 89.12% in MAE, 82.30% in RMSE, and 25.00% in MAPE, with extensive evaluations demonstrating that STeP-Diff effectively captures the spatio-temporal dependencies in air pollution fields."

Our approach explicitly decouples locomotion and manipulation into two specialized visuomotor policies, allowing each subsystem to rely on its own observations. This mitigates the performance degradation that arise when a single policy is forced to fuse heterogeneous, potentially mismatched observations from locomotion and manipulation. Our key innovation lies in restoring coordination between these two independent policies through a vision-language foundation model, which encodes global observations and language instructions into a shared latent embedding conditioning both diffusion policies. On top of this backbone, we introduce a phase-progress head that uses textual descriptions of task stages to infer discrete phase and continuous progress estimates without manual phase labels. To further structure the latent space, we incorporate a coordination-aware contrastive loss that explicitly encodes cross-subsystem compatibility between arm and base actions. We evaluate FALCON on two challenging loco-manipulation tasks requiring navigation, precise end-effector placement, and tight base-arm coordination. Results show that it surpasses centralized and decentralized baselines while exhibiting improved robustness and generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios."

      "summary": "Autonomous landing on sloped terrain poses significant challenges for small, lightweight spacecraft, such as rotorcraft and landers. These vehicles have limited processing capability and payload capacity, which makes advanced deep learning methods and heavy sensors impractical. Flying insects, such as bees, achieve remarkable landings with minimal neural and sensory resources, relying heavily on optical flow. By regulating flow divergence, a measure of vertical velocity divided by height, they perform smooth landings in which velocity and height decay exponentially together. However, adapting this bio-inspired strategy for spacecraft landings on sloped terrain presents two key challenges: global flow-divergence estimates obscure terrain inclination, and the nonlinear nature of divergence-based control can lead to instability when using conventional controllers. This paper proposes a nonlinear control strategy that leverages two distinct local flow divergence estimates to regulate both thrust and attitude during vertical landings. The control law is formulated based on Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion to handle the nonlinear flow divergence. The thrust control ensures a smooth vertical descent by keeping a constant average of the local flow divergence estimates, while the attitude control aligns the vehicle with the inclined surface at touchdown by exploiting their difference. The approach is evaluated in numerical simulations using a simplified 2D spacecraft model across varying slopes and divergence setpoints. Results show that regulating the average divergence yields stable landings with exponential decay of velocity and height, and using the divergence difference enables effective alignment with inclined terrain. Overall, the method offers a robust, low-resource landing strategy that enhances the feasibility of autonomous planetary missions with small spacecraft."

In this work, we develop a fairly tight quantitative analogue of the underlying Denjoy-Carleman theorem via complex analysis, and show that this allows for nonasymptotic control of the rate of approximation by polynomials for any smooth function with polynomial growth at infinity. In many cases, this allows us to establish $L^2$ approximation-theoretic results for functions over general classes of distributions (e.g., multivariate sub-Gaussian or sub-exponential distributions) which were previously known only in special cases. As one application, we show that the Paley--Wiener class of functions bandlimited to $[-Ω,Ω]$ admits superexponential rates of approximation over all strictly sub-exponential distributions, which leads to a new characterization of the class. As another application, we solve an open problem recently posed by Chandrasekaran, Klivans, Kontonis, Meka and Stavropoulos on the smoothed analysis of learning, and also obtain quantitative improvements to their main results and applications."

In light of the previous constraints, we introduce AutoGuard to the DevSecOps ecosystem, a reinforcement learning (RL)-powered self-healing security framework built to pre-emptively protect DevSecOps environments. AutoGuard is a self-securing security environment that continuously observes pipeline activities for potential anomalies while preemptively remediating the environment. The model observes and reacts based on a policy that is continually learned dynamically over time. The RL agent improves each action over time through reward-based learning aimed at improving the agent's ability to prevent, detect and respond to a security incident in real-time. Testing using simulated ContinuousIntegration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) environments showed AutoGuard to successfully improve threat detection accuracy by 22%, reduce mean time torecovery (MTTR) for incidents by 38% and increase overall resilience to incidents as compared to traditional methods.\n  Keywords- DevSecOps, Reinforcement Learning, Self- Healing Security, Continuous Integration, Automated Threat Mitigation"

However, these agents remain brittle when faced with real-world exceptions, making Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) supervision essential for mission-critical applications. In this paper, we present AgentBay, a novel sandbox service designed from the ground up for hybrid interaction. AgentBay provides secure, isolated execution environments spanning Windows, Linux, Android, Web Browsers, and Code interpreters. Its core contribution is a unified session accessible via a hybrid control interface: An AI agent can interact programmatically via mainstream interfaces (MCP, Open Source SDK), while a human operator can, at any moment, seamlessly take over full manual control. This seamless intervention is enabled by Adaptive Streaming Protocol (ASP). Unlike traditional VNC/RDP, ASP is specifically engineered for this hybrid use case, delivering an ultra-low-latency, smoother user experience that remains resilient even in weak network environments. It achieves this by dynamically blending command-based and video-based streaming, adapting its encoding strategy based on network conditions and the current controller (AI or human). Our evaluation demonstrates strong results in security, performance, and task completion rates. In a benchmark of complex tasks, the AgentBay (Agent + Human) model achieved more than 48% success rate improvement. Furthermore, our ASP protocol reduces bandwidth consumption by up to 50% compared to standard RDP, and in end-to-end latency with around 5% reduction, especially under poor network conditions.

To address this, we propose a Multi-frequency Adaptive Fusion Network (MAFNet), which can produce high-quality disparity maps using only efficient 2D convolutions. Specifically, we design an adaptive frequency-domain filtering attention module that decomposes the full cost volume into high-frequency and low-frequency volumes, performing frequency-aware feature aggregation separately. Subsequently, we introduce a Linformer-based low-rank attention mechanism to adaptively fuse high- and low-frequency information, yielding more robust disparity estimation.

SANTA employs a hallucinative self-augmentation scheme to identify the potential hallucinations that lie in the MLLM and transform the original captions to the contrasted negatives.

Yet despite rapid progress in code generation, today's Large Language Models (LLMs) are rarely tested on this kind of forward-looking reasoning. We close that gap with gpuFLOPBench, a benchmark that asks models to \"count without running\" by predicting single and double-precision FLOP counts for 577 CUDA kernels drawn from HeCBench, annotated with ground-truth profiles and eight execution attributes that distinguish trivially analyzable code from kernels whose FLOPs depend on hidden compiler or runtime behavior. Evaluating current closed-source reasoning models shows clear but uneven progress: the newest LLMs achieve perfect classification on straightforward kernels but still incur multiple order-of-magnitude errors whenever implicit FLOPs arise from division, intrinsic math functions, or common subexpressions. These results surface a core limitation of existing code assistants -- the inability to internalize hardware-specific microcode effects -- and position gpuFLOPBench as a focused testbed for developing LLM tooling that can reason about performance with the same rigor as experienced GPU developers.
