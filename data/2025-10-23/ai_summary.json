We bridge this \"narrative gap\" with HoloCine, a model\nthat generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the\nfirst shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control\nthrough a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to\nspecific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within\nshots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale\ngeneration. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,\nHoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for\ncharacters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work\nmarks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making\nend-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:\nhttps://holo-cine.github.io/.",

To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an\ninteractive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.\nOur approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel\nrepresentation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling\nocclusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected\nlayers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly\nto the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the\nproposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects\nthrough intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires\nno architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings\ncombined with a new complementary data sampling strategy.

While\nthese models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such\nas images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),\ntranslating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open\nchallenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including\nshared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific\narchitectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this\nwork, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a\ngeneral-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable\nextension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent\nspace, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without\nrequiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to\nenforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a\ndomain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in\nlatent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training\ntoward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training\nstrategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs\nand performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape\ngeneration, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.\nComprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our\nframework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.\nFor more information, see our project page:\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/lddbm/home.",

We propose VAMOS, a hierarchical VLA that\ndecouples semantic planning from embodiment grounding: a generalist planner\nlearns from diverse, open-world data, while a specialist affordance model\nlearns the robot's physical constraints and capabilities in safe, low-cost\nsimulation. We enabled this separation by carefully designing an interface that\nlets a high-level planner propose candidate paths directly in image space that\nthe affordance model then evaluates and re-ranks. Our real-world experiments\nshow that VAMOS achieves higher success rates in both indoor and complex\noutdoor navigation than state-of-the-art model-based and end-to-end learning\nmethods. We also show that our hierarchical design enables cross-embodied\nnavigation across legged and wheeled robots and is easily steerable using\nnatural language. Real-world ablations confirm that the specialist model is key\nto embodiment grounding, enabling a single high-level planner to be deployed\nacross physically distinct wheeled and legged robots. Finally, this model\nsignificantly enhances single-robot reliability, achieving 3X higher success\nrates by rejecting physically infeasible plans. Website:\nhttps://vamos-vla.github.io/",

Many such\nachievements have been driven by the extensive use of simulation as a critical\ntool for training and testing robotic systems prior to their deployment in\nreal-world environments. However, simulations consist of abstractions and\napproximations that inevitably introduce discrepancies between simulated and\nreal environments, known as the reality gap. These discrepancies significantly\nhinder the successful transfer of systems from simulation to the real world.\nClosing this gap remains one of the most pressing challenges in robotics.\nRecent advances in sim-to-real transfer have demonstrated promising results\nacross various platforms, including locomotion, navigation, and manipulation.\nBy leveraging techniques such as domain randomization, real-to-sim transfer,\nstate and action abstractions, and sim-real co-training, many works have\novercome the reality gap. However, challenges persist, and a deeper\nunderstanding of the reality gap's root causes and solutions is necessary. In\nthis survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the sim-to-real landscape,\nhighlighting the causes, solutions, and evaluation metrics for the reality gap\nand sim-to-real transfer.",

We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)\nOnly a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --\neliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's\nsingular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the\nfactorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple\nsubspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces\noverfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to\n24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just\n100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the\nindicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to\nfurther reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream\ntasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show\nthat combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for\ndownstream tasks.

This, in turn, poses a challenge for\ndeep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a\nbiologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most\nexciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and\nadversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nreconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual\ncortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded\nneurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers\nof the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can\nreconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500\nneurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified\nbenchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results\ndemonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and\nprovide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.",

While these range image representations enable\nefficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental\ngeometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,\ncompromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR\nIntrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,\nsensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from\nspinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or\ncalibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic\ngeometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters\nincluding laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam\ncalibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud\nreconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the\ncomplete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect\npoint preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric\naccuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing\ngeometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a\ncompression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,\ndemonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications.

While existing KV cache\ncompression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize\nstorage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns\nthat emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first\nanalyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying\nlevels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on\nimportance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information\ndistribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage.

To address these\nissues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning\nframework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable\nself-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable\nintelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model\nemploys a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial\nrepresentations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map\n(Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking\nneural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps,\nimproving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset,\nHybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several\nstate-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational\nprofile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations,\nthe framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and\nautomated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces\ncontamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and\noperational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global\nsustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities,\ncircular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.",

However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale\nhigh-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training\nstrategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the\nfirst challenge, we introduce \\textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of\n100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual\nfidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on\ndetail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the\nsecond challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that\nenhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we\ndesign (i) \\textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning\non detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \\textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency\nRegularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to\nsoftly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail\npreservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail\nquality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation.

This has\nenabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned\n3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,\nlong-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders\nthat are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs\nfine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce\nBTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder\nthat unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,\nfrequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables\n(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)\nlong-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice\nexcerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional\nmemory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it\nimproves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and\nMerlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared\nto GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically\nconsistent 512*512*241 volumes.

However, dental\nimaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic\nartifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity\narising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often\nproves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence\n(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to\nthese issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis\nand treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as\nthe most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature\nextraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent\nprogress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL\nresearch-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260\nstudies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available\ndental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the\nbasic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and\nacquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational\ntechniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to\ndifferent DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization\nstrategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize\ncommonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we\ndiscuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential\nfuture directions.

Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)\ncan process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long\nsequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or\ninconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most\ninformative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal\ndependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide\ncomplete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus\nEvidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video\nunderstanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two\nkey components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module\nselects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM\nreasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns\nembeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus\nRefinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and\nvisual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.\nExtensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and\nrobustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection\nfor Video-LLMs.",

The model\nhighlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,\nallowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable\nthis functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,\nSTGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed\ntemporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either\ntemporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified\nspatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start\nreinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that\njointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.\nOn V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nraising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent\nimprovements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding\nbenchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond\naccuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable\nsignals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and\nimproving answer reliability.",

However,\npersonalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge\ndue to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept\ndistributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation\nframework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).\nOur approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step\ndiffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained\nsimultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the\nstudent, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the\nEchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure\nconsistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is\noptimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and\nwith alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.\nFurthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,\nwherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to\nfeedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation\nmechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts\nbut also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms\nexisting personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel\nparadigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.",

Recent research addresses\nthis topic by the use of elastic elements and particularly series elastic\nactuators (SEA). This paper explores the possibilities of minimizing energy\nconsumption of SEA actuated PKM performing pick-and-place tasks. The basic idea\nis to excite eigenmotions that result from the actuator springs and exploit\ntheir oscillating characteristics. To this end, a prescribed cyclic\npick-and-place operation is analyzed and a dynamic model of SEA driven PKM is\nderived. Subsequently, an energy minimizing optimal control problem is\nformulated where operating trajectories as well as SEA stiffnesses are\noptimized simultaneously. Here, optimizing the actuator stiffness does not\naccount for variable stiffness actuators. It serves as a tool for the design\nand dimensioning process. The hypothesis on energy reduction is tested on two\n(parallel) robot applications where redundant actuation is also addressed. The\nresults confirm the validity of this approach.",

We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,\nfairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via\nintra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any\ndemographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and\nethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results\nshow that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on\nethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute.

Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,\nour method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,\nenabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing\nattention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model\nability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC\nimages. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,\nwhich effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,\nenhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is\nfurther optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the\ntraining procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image\nquality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as\nGamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and\nPix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution\nand feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to\nstandardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale\nfrequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for\nbetter feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic\nAlgorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model\nfrom a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational\ncost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000\nhistopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images\n(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.",

However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a\ncooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning\ncross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and\nrecipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually\napparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the\nrepresentations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting\nin difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of\ningredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is\nexpected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and\nrecipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal\napproach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,\nwhile explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation\nlearning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard\nmonolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural\ncuisine dataset.

They typically require\nextremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training\nto achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a\nkey source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip\nwith, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at\nmulti-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage\nhyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides\na principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and\ntextual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an\nefficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize\nvisual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary\ngranularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic\nspace. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\\\"{o}bius multiplication\noperations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling\nmatrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible\nyet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across\nmultiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both\nexisting pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\\%\nadditional parameters.",

In\nthis paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating\ninstructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives\nand enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.\nTo achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill\nmulti-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to\noptimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and\nUI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding\nbenchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and\nsynthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference.

Our work is\nmotivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features\ninherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are\ninsufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we\nintroduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework\nbuilt upon a novel \"compression-aggregation-compression\" architecture. The\nfirst stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary\nprocessor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding\nnetwork to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A\nsubsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a\nfinal semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head\nwith self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative\nembeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer\n(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that\nKINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,\noffering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution\nscenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective\nsolution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy\nAI in SAR image analysis.",

However,\nexisting Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language\nfield, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic\nsegmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,\nwe present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that\ncontributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation\ncues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of\ncollaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the\ncornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the\ncollaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship\nbetween the instance field and language field, through a novel\ninstance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage\ntraining strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the\ntwo fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt\nrefinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive\nexperiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing\nmethods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to\nvarious applications,~\\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical\nsegmentation, and robotics.

In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result\nsolely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?\nAfter a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the\nrisk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased\nreliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.\nBuilding on these insights, we propose a novel \"induce-detect-suppress\"\nframework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed\ncontexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,\nand ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual\ndecoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all\nbenchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved\nhallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,\nre-validate our hypothesis on context.

However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by\nthe approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,\nwhich arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate\ngenerative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the\nparameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,\nand leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate\nquantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more\neffective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose\n\\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \\emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized\ngenerative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective\nimage inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and\nimage style preservation, enabling precise image inversion.

Mainstream approaches always\nadopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first\ncorrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image\nunder the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate\nstate in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing\nsource image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the\nspecific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability\nor inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the\nsource. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be\ntarget-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while\npreserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel\ninversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption\nwith learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By\niteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source\nwith dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware\nintermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source\nconsistency.

However, existing discrete classification methods fail to\ncapture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early\nintervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion\nProgression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification\nto continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving\nsuspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies\nand cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based\non these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous\nchanges while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce\nSuspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using\nmultimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.\nAdditionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link\nsuspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into\nboth the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive\nexperiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms\nexisting methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.\nNotably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating\nits superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes.

Despite its importance, this task\nremains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal\nconsistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to\naddress this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental\ntrade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas\ncapturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.\nTo address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling\nlong-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo\nmatching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we\npropose a \\textbf{P}ick-and-\\textbf{P}lay \\textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction\nmodule for dynamic \\textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \\textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM\nconsists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a\n`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal\naggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet\nhighly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent\ninformation aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of\nPPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and\ntemporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the\nSintel clean/final (17.3\\% \\& 9.02\\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer\ncomputational costs.

Many of these environments often exhibit strong structural\npriors--for instance, pipes often span across sink cabinets--that can be\nexploited to anticipate unseen structure and avoid unnecessary collisions. We\npresent a theoretically complete and empirically efficient framework for\nmanipulation in the blind that integrates contact feedback with structural\npriors to enable robust operation in unknown environments. The framework\ncomprises three tightly coupled components: (i) a contact detection and\nlocalization module that utilizes joint torque sensing with a contact particle\nfilter to detect and localize contacts, (ii) an occupancy estimation module\nthat uses the history of contact observations to build a partial occupancy map\nof the workspace and extrapolate it into unexplored regions with learned\npredictors, and (iii) a planning module that accounts for the fact that contact\nlocalization estimates and occupancy predictions can be noisy, computing paths\nthat avoid collisions and complete tasks efficiently without eliminating\nfeasible solutions. We evaluate the system in simulation and in the real world\non a UR10e manipulator across two domestic tasks--(i) manipulating a valve\nunder a kitchen sink surrounded by pipes and (ii) retrieving a target object\nfrom a cluttered shelf.

A\nphysics-based adhesion model of a quadrupedal magnetic climbing robot is\nincorporated into simulation to capture partial contact, air-gap sensitivity,\nand probabilistic attachment failures. To stabilize learning and enable\nreliable transfer, we design a three-phase curriculum: (1) acquire a crawl gait\non flat ground without adhesion, (2) gradually rotate the gravity vector to\nvertical while activating the adhesion model, and (3) inject stochastic\nadhesion failures to encourage slip recovery.

Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of\nmovable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.\n6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,\nbut 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle\nvary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes\nits 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not\nnecessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the\nactual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for\ncategory-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a\nsingle RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and\nrotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the\nrotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body\nframe. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained\nbicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates\nthe 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix\nof synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an\nevaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose\nparameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive\nscores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators\nthat use rigid canonical object templates for matching.",

In spite of its effectiveness of light flow\ncomputations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or\nspecialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens\narray. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we\npropose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only\nsingle images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to\nimplicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our\nmethod reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in\nthe opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a\nneural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our\nneural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input\nimage, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and\nfinally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.\nAfter the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input\nimage, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source\nrays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent\ngeneration of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based\nrendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining\nor finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant\nstate-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.",

However, its\nquadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.\nGiven that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing\nefforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a\npersistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations\nhave not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this\npaper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what\nprinciples give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental\ninsights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research\n(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \\textit{Adaptive routing}:\nSA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic\ncontent, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.\n(2) \\textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token\nweighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,\nwhereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable\nredundancy. Based on this, we propose \\textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),\na principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically\ninjects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\\times3$ kernels, ATConv\nconsistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.\nBuilding on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain\n\\textbf{84.4\\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In\ndiffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\\times\n3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster\nsampling.

            "summary": "Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical\ntraining, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains\nlimited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with\nvideo sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform\napplication for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in\nminimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life\ncycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an\ninternal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability\nheuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design\narchitecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the\nsame heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability\nand adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware\nconfigurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested\nthe prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),\nwith the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After\nrefinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived\nusefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic\nusability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).\nProcessing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),\nand machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,\nuser-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video\nmanagement. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation\nare needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.\nThe software is available at https://camma-public.github.io/Endoshare/",
