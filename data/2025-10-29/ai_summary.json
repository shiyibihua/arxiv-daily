            "summary": "Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,\nyet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing\nmethods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is\nresource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen\neffects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video\ngeneration. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,\nenabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto\ntarget content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to\nunseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning\nstrategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context\nattention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential\neffect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect\nimitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient\none-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on\ntough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories\nof effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain\neffects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a\ncomprehensive dataset to the community.",

Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on\noptimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision\nor on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric\napproximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D\ngeneration of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with\nthe advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending\nthese methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models\nposes significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a\ntraining-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of\ntraining a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a\npre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape\nprior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by\ntreating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images\ncaptured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the\nobject's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring\ntask-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our\nmethod generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts\nunderlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object\ncategories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D\ncompletes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art\napproaches in both quality and versatility.",

In this work, we propose GeT-USE, a\ntwo-step procedure that learns to perform real-robot generalized tool usage by\nlearning first to extend the robot's embodiment in simulation and then\ntransferring the learned strategies to real-robot visuomotor policies. Our key\ninsight is that by exploring a robot's embodiment extensions (i.e., building\nnew end-effectors) in simulation, the robot can identify the general tool\ngeometries most beneficial for a task.

To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's\nhidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of\ntargeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart\nVLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We\nfurther evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and\nintroduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields\nimproved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.

            "summary": "Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread\nattention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,\nwhile the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of\nregions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational\nredundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead\napplying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates\nus to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that\naccelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE\nframework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We\nobserved that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for\nmulti-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in\nthe early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited\nregions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the\nreference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,\nwe replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.\nFor edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative\ndenoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,\nwe propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost\nwhile incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.\nObserving that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity\nsimilarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate\nthe local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base\nmodels, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE\nachieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06.

When a\ndomain's refinability is poor, task-level plans that appear valid may\nultimately fail during motion planning, requiring replanning and resulting in\nslower overall performance. Prior works mitigate this by encoding refinement\nissues as constraints to prune infeasible task plans.

To\naddress this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first\ngenerates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then\nperforms auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and\ninformative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a\nsequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs\nconvey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture\nthe redundancy across consecutive AD outputs.

However, by reducing\ncomplex cost functions to formations, discrepancies arise between maintaining\nthe shape and minimizing the original cost function. For example, a Diamond or\nBox formation shape is often used for protecting all members of the formation.\nWhen more information about the surrounding environment becomes available, a\nstatic shape often no longer minimizes the original protection cost. We propose\na formation planner to reduce mismatch between a formation and the cost\nfunction while still leveraging efficient formation controllers. Our formation\nplanner is a two-step optimization problem that identifies desired relative\nrobot positions. We first solve a constrained problem to estimate non-linear\nand non-differentiable costs with a weighted sum of surrogate cost functions.\nWe theoretically analyze this problem and identify situations where weights do\nnot need to be updated. The weighted, surrogate cost function is then minimized\nusing relative positions between robots. The desired relative positions are\nrealized using a non-cooperative formation controller derived from Lyapunov's\ndirect approach. We then demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for\nmilitary-like costs such as protection and obstacle avoidance. In simulations,\nwe show a formation planner can reduce a single cost by over 75%. When\nminimizing a variety of cost functions simultaneously, using a formation\nplanner with adaptive weights can reduce the cost by 20-40%. Formation planning\nprovides better performance by minimizing a surrogate cost function that\nclosely approximates the original cost function instead of relying on a shape\nabstraction.",

To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences\nwhile maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action\nRecognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D\nAction Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims\nto proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,\nhas been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample\nselection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to\nembed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,\ncombined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,\nis utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for\nannotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not\nnecessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may\nhave already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.\nTo solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active\nlearning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process\n(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an\ninformative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of\nskeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of\nthe factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from\nEuclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning\nstrategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.\nExtensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method.",

In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device\nmulti-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.\nInstead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire\ninference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,\nallowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive.

Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for\nfine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during\ninference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and\ninput data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration\noptimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for\neach modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping\nmechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early\npredictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public\nmultimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle\n(UAV)-based multimodal testbed.

While deep optics with\nelements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication\ncomplexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity.

We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a\nsynthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This\nsimulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction\nnetwork that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity\nAll-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.\nExtensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed\nframework.

However, most previous methods\nusually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects\nand gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both\nthe training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an\nauxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization\nacross the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this\nend, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and\ngaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors\nduring inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded\nspecific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,\nwhich extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using\nthe shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared\nbackbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain\nhead-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head\ndetection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing\nthe gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense\nfeature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the\nsuboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,\nwe propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the\ngaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity\nover Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to\nvariations between bounding boxes.

In prior research on navigating\nbetween different environments such as land and water, the primary strategy\nemployed involves switching to a controller that generates an appropriate gait\nfor the new environment upon entering it. However, designing appropriate gaits\nfor each complex and diverse environment and accurately determining controller\nswitching for each environment is challenging. Therefore, this research\ndevelops a centipede-type mobile robot that navigates both aquatic and\nterrestrial environments with a simple, unified control scheme, based on the\nimplicit-explicit control philosophy and by ingeniously designing the robot's\nbody structure. In this research, we developed the robot featuring flexible\njoints and left and right legs on each body segment and focused on the leg\nstructure which has extensive contact with the environment. This paper\nevaluates the locomotion performance on land and water using the three\ndeveloped leg structures, using the robot's leg slip rate and actuator energy\nconsumption as evaluation metrics. The experimental results confirmed the\nexistence of an appropriate leg structure capable of navigating both aquatic\nand terrestrial environments under identical control.",

Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from\nunreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain\ndiscrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due\nto enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address\nthis limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named\nDiffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages\nunlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively\nrefine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target\nsamples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of\npseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For\nsamples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to\nsemantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while\nsimultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent\ndiffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that\nprogressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain\nand the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark\ndatasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the\nperformance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.",

While transferring into\nhand articulatied object interaction (HAOI), the hand grasps synthesis requires\nnot only object functionality but also long-term manipulation sequence along\nthe object deformation. This paper proposes a novel HAOI sequence generation\nframework SynHLMA, to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated\nobjects. Given a complete point cloud of an articulated object, we utilize a\ndiscrete HAOI representation to model each hand object interaction frame. Along\nwith the natural language embeddings, the representations are trained by an\nHAOI manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its\nlanguage description in a shared representation space. A joint-aware loss is\nemployed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated\nobject joints. In this way, our SynHLMA achieves three typical hand\nmanipulation tasks for articulated objects of HAOI generation, HAOI prediction\nand HAOI interpolation. We evaluate SynHLMA on our built HAOI-lang dataset and\nexperimental results demonstrate the superior hand grasp sequence generation\nperformance comparing with state-of-the-art.

Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain\nscenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to\ntheir reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce\nDeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local\nsensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen\nforgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:\nLocal Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG\napplies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture\nfine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces\ndomain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding\nfeature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and\nenhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and\nglobal analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior\nrobustness against unseen deepfake attacks.",

Despite recent progress in\nspeech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally\nexpressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the\nscarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of\ndata capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech\nand emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset\nwith neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences\n(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and\nemotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement\nbetween the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture\ninherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The\nlearned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose\nparameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.\nQualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally\ngenerates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate\nlip synchronization.

A persistent\nchallenge, however, is maintaining robust target tracking under partial or full\nocclusions. Classical methods like Lucas-Kanade (LK) offer lightweight tracking\nbut are fragile to occlusion and drift, while deep learning-based approaches\noften require continuous visibility and intensive computation. To address these\ngaps, we propose a hybrid visual tracking framework that bridges advanced\nperception with real-time servo control. First, a fast global template matcher\nconstrains the pose search region; next, a deep-feature Lucas-Kanade module\noperating on early VGG layers refines alignment to sub-pixel accuracy (<2px);\nthen, a lightweight residual regressor corrects local misalignments caused by\ntexture degradation or partial occlusion. When visual confidence falls below a\nthreshold, a GRU-based predictor seamlessly extrapolates pose updates from\nrecent motion history. Crucially, the pipeline's final outputs-translation,\nrotation, and scale deltas-are packaged as direct control signals for 30Hz\nimage-based servo loops. Evaluated on handheld video sequences with up to 90%\nocclusion, our system sustains under 2px tracking error, demonstrating the\nrobustness and low-latency precision essential for reliable real-world robot\nvision applications.",

This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation\nof high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.\n1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve\nthe target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since\nthe model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its\nperformance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become\nbiased towards the generated data.\n  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original\nrectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into\nthe training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method\neffectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we\ndemonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much\nsmaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved\nsignificantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in\nfull-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the\noriginal method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids\nsaturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE\nlearning while preserving the distribution of real images.",

Despite\nrecent advances, language-driven navigation is still difficult, particularly\nfor UAVs in small-scale 3D environments. Existing Vision-Language Navigation\n(VLN) approaches are mostly designed for ground robots and struggle to\ngeneralize to aerial tasks that require full 3D spatial reasoning. The\nemergence of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as GPT and Claude,\nenables zero-shot semantic reasoning from visual and textual inputs. However,\nthese models lack spatial grounding and are not directly applicable to\nnavigation. To address these limitations, SoraNav is introduced, an adaptive\nUAV navigation framework that integrates zero-shot VLM reasoning with\ngeometry-aware decision-making. Geometric priors are incorporated into image\nannotations to constrain the VLM action space and improve decision quality. A\nhybrid switching strategy leverages navigation history to alternate between VLM\nreasoning and geometry-based exploration, mitigating dead-ends and redundant\nrevisits. A PX4-based hardware-software platform, comprising both a digital\ntwin and a physical micro-UAV, enables reproducible evaluation. Experimental\nresults show that in 2.5D scenarios, our method improves Success Rate (SR) by\n25.7% and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) by 17%. In 3D scenarios, it\nimproves SR by 29.5% and SPL by 18.5% relative to the baseline.",

However, current urban scene\nreconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,\n\\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR\npoint clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring\nsuch accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise\nspatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they\nmay not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial\nmisalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To\navoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a\nLiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain\ngeometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more\naccurate. $\\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by\nback-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then\noptimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.\n$\\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense\nmetric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors\nfrom a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.\nIn turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during\nGaussian training. $\\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground\ngeometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within\nroad regions.

Creating similar swarm intelligence in\nengineered robots poses challenges to the design of collaborative algorithms\nthat can be programmed at large scales. The assignment-based method has played\nan eminent role for a very long time in solving collaboration problems of robot\nswarms. However, it faces fundamental limitations in terms of efficiency and\nrobustness due to its unscalability to swarm variants. This article presents a\ntutorial review on recent advances in assignment-free collaboration of robot\nswarms, focusing on the problem of shape formation. A key theoretical component\nis the recently developed \\emph{mean-shift exploration} strategy, which\nimproves the collaboration efficiency of large-scale swarms by dozens of times.\nFurther, the efficiency improvement is more significant as the swarm scale\nincreases. Finally, this article discusses three important applications of the\nmean-shift exploration strategy, including precise shape formation, area\ncoverage formation, and maneuvering formation, as well as their corresponding\nindustrial scenarios in smart warehousing, area exploration, and cargo\ntransportation.",

However, existing methods still struggle to\nachieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free\n(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by\nproviding fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require\nextensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their\naccessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling\nimage generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over\nfacial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that\nenables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity\npreservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model\nto extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$\nlatent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model\nwith a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial\nidentity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,\nensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the\nFFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with\nfine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional\nfine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our\napproach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute\ncontrol, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality,\nadaptable facial image synthesis.

However, the calibration of these platforms using forward\nkinematics is a challenge for researchers because forward kinematics normally\ngenerates multiple feasible and unfeasible solutions for any pose of the moving\nplatform. The complex kinematic relations among the six actuator paths\nconnecting the fixed base to the moving platform further compound the\ndifficulty in establishing a straightforward and efficient calibration method.\nThe authors developed a new forward kinematics-based calibration method using\nDenavit-Hartenberg convention and used the Stewart platform Tiger 66.1\ndeveloped in their lab for experimenting with the photogrammetry-based\ncalibration strategies described in this paper. This system became operational\nupon completion of construction, marking its inaugural use. The authors used\ntheir calibration model for estimating the errors in the system and adopted\nthree compensation options or strategies as per Least Square method to improve\nthe accuracy of the system. These strategies leveraged a high-resolution\ndigital camera and off-the-shelf software to capture the poses of the moving\nplatform's center. This process is non-invasive and does not need any\nadditional equipment to be attached to the hexapod or any alteration of the\nhexapod hardware. This photogrammetry-based calibration process involves\nmultiple high-resolution images from different angles to measure the position\nand orientation of the platform center in the three-dimensional space. The\nTarget poses and Actual poses are then compared, and the error compensations\nare estimated using the Least-Squared methods to calculate the Predicted poses.\nResults from each of the three compensation approaches demonstrated noticeable\nenhancements in platform pose accuracies, suggesting room for further\nimprovements.",

Inspired by this principle, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal\nrecurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the\nfree-energy principle, capable of directly integrating over 30,000-dimensional\nvisuo-proprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction. The model was\nable to learn two representative caregiving tasks, rigid-body repositioning and\nflexible-towel wiping, without task-specific feature engineering. We\ndemonstrate three key properties: (i) self-organization of hierarchical latent\ndynamics that regulate task transitions, capture variability in uncertainty,\nand infer occluded states; (ii) robustness to degraded vision through\nvisuo-proprioceptive integration; and (iii) asymmetric interference in\nmultitask learning, where the more variable wiping task had little influence on\nrepositioning, whereas learning the repositioning task led to a modest\nreduction in wiping performance, while the model maintained overall robustness.\nAlthough the evaluation was limited to simulation, these results establish\npredictive processing as a universal and scalable computational principle,\npointing toward robust, flexible, and autonomous caregiving robots while\noffering theoretical insight into the human brain's ability to achieve flexible\nadaptation in uncertain real-world environments.",
