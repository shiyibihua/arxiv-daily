            "summary": "Reasoning over dynamic visual content remains a central challenge for multimodal large language models. Recent thinking models generate explicit reasoning traces for interpretability; however, their reasoning often appears convincing while being logically inconsistent or weakly grounded in visual evidence. We identify and formalize these issues through two diagnostic metrics: Think Answer Consistency (TAC), which measures the alignment between reasoning and answers, and Video Attention Score (VAS), which captures the extent to which reasoning depends on visual versus textual cues. Analysis across 11 video reasoning benchmarks shows that current models rely heavily on linguistic priors rather than visual content. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that enhances both temporal precision and reasoning consistency. Our approach combines timestamp aware supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by a novel Temporal Alignment Reward (TAR). This dual step post training stage encourages temporally aligned and causally coherent video reasoning. The resulting model, Video R2, achieves consistently higher TAC, VAS, and accuracy across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that improvements in temporal alignment and reasoning coherence lead to more accurate and trustworthy video understanding.

            "summary": "Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced video understanding, yet most still \"think about videos\" ie once a video is encoded, reasoning unfolds entirely in text, treating visual input as a static context. This passive paradigm creates a semantic bottleneck: models cannot rewatch, refocus, or verify evidence, leading to shallow visual reasoning on tasks requiring fine grained spatio temporal understanding. In this work, we introduce Interactive Video Reasoning, a new paradigm that transforms video into an active cognitive workspace, enabling models to \"think with videos\". Our model, Video CoM, reasons through a Chain of Manipulations (CoM), performing iterative visual actions to gather and refine evidence. To support this behavior, we construct Video CoM Instruct, an 18K instruction tuning dataset curated for multi step manipulation reasoning. Beyond supervised learning, we further optimize the manipulation policy via reinforcement learning with reasoning aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike prior work that relies solely on sparse answer rewards, our method introduces step level reasoning rewards, guiding the model toward grounded and consistent reasoning. Video CoM achieves strong results across nine video reasoning benchmarks, improving average performance by 3.6 percent over recent state of the art models, while training on only 25K SFT and 3K GRPO video samples, significantly fewer than comparable large scale models. Ablation studies demonstrate that reasoning aware rewards improve both accuracy and interpretability. Code: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/Video-CoM",

While multi-turn interaction offers a superior understanding of environmental dynamics via authentic feedback, current approaches often impose a rigid reasoning process, which constrains the model's active learning, ultimately hindering efficient world model reasoning. To address these issues, we explore world-model internalization through efficient interaction and active reasoning (WMAct), which liberates the model from structured reasoning, allowing the model to shape thinking directly through its doing, and achieves effective and efficient world model reasoning with two key mechanisms: (1) a reward rescaling mechanism adjusting outcome reward based on action efficacy to incentivize redundancy reduction and purposeful interaction; (2) an interaction frequency annealing strategy to progressively reduce the maximum allowed interaction turns, which compels the model to condense its learning and internalize environmental dynamics rather than over-relying on environmental cues. Our experiments on Sokoban, Maze, and Taxi show that WMAct yields effective world model reasoning capable of resolving tasks in a single turn that previously required multiple interactions and fosters strong transferability to complex environments, improving performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks.",

While a few preliminary works have explored audio-driven multi-person talking video generation, they often face challenges due to the high costs of diverse multi-person data collection and the difficulty of driving multiple identities with coherent interactivity. To address these challenges, we propose AnyTalker, a multi-person generation framework that features an extensible multi-stream processing architecture. Specifically, we extend Diffusion Transformer's attention block with a novel identity-aware attention mechanism that iteratively processes identity-audio pairs, allowing arbitrary scaling of drivable identities. Besides, training multi-person generative models demands massive multi-person data. Our proposed training pipeline depends solely on single-person videos to learn multi-person speaking patterns and refines interactivity with only a few real multi-person clips. Furthermore, we contribute a targeted metric and dataset designed to evaluate the naturalness and interactivity of the generated multi-person videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyTalker achieves remarkable lip synchronization, visual quality, and natural interactivity, striking a favorable balance between data costs and identity scalability.",

However, it relies on ensembles of frontier LLMs to achieve new bounds and is a pure inference system that models cannot internalize the evolving strategies. We introduce ThetaEvolve, an open-source framework that simplifies and extends AlphaEvolve to efficiently scale both in-context learning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) at test time, allowing models to continually learn from their experiences in improving open optimization problems. ThetaEvolve features a single LLM, a large program database for enhanced exploration, batch sampling for higher throughput, lazy penalties to discourage stagnant outputs, and optional reward shaping for stable training signals, etc. ThetaEvolve is the first evolving framework that enable a small open-source model, like DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, to achieve new best-known bounds on open problems (circle packing and first auto-correlation inequality) mentioned in AlphaEvolve. Besides, across two models and four open tasks, we find that ThetaEvolve with RL at test-time consistently outperforms inference-only baselines, and the model indeed learns evolving capabilities, as the RL-trained checkpoints demonstrate faster progress and better final performance on both trained target task and other unseen tasks.

However, it remains underexplored whether these representations, optimized for multimodal understanding tasks, harbor an inherent potential for visual generation. In this paper, we propose VGT, Visual Generation Tuning, a novel paradigm designed to stimulate the underlying capabilities of visual generation within any vision language models. By performing efficient visual generation tuning on well-pretrained VLMs, we significantly mitigate the alignment costs and accelerate the convergence of autoregressive modeling in the continuous space (20x speedup). Specifically, we dismiss the entangled pixel-level VAEs designed for diffusion transformers and formulate VGT-AE through aligning the semantic encoders from pretrained VLMs with the latent representations of pixel decoders. In image reconstruction tasks, we achieve 26.67 PSNR and 0.50 rFID at a 28x compression ratio, outperforming specialized VAEs; in visual generation tasks, we achieve state-of-the-art outcomes among autoregressive models, 0.77 on GenEval and 78.73 on DPG-Bench. Furthermore, our proposed VGT showcases significant scaling promise and is versatile for endowing any VLMs trained for multimodal understanding with the capabilities of visual generation, which paves the new avenue to explore next-generation unified multimodal foundation models.

We find that the price for a given level of benchmark performance has decreased remarkably fast, around $5\\times$ to $10\\times$ per year, for frontier models on knowledge, reasoning, math, and software engineering benchmarks. These reductions in the cost of AI inference are due to economic forces, hardware efficiency improvements, and algorithmic efficiency improvements. Isolating out open models to control for competition effects and dividing by hardware price declines, we estimate that algorithmic efficiency progress is around $3\\times$ per year.

However, extending a model's detection capability to new object classes requires large amounts of annotated training data, which is costly and time-consuming to acquire, especially for long-tailed classes with insufficient representation in existing datasets. Here, we introduce the object-centric data setting, when limited data is available in the form of object-centric data (multi-view images or 3D models), and systematically evaluate the performance of four different data synthesis methods to finetune object detection models on novel object categories in this setting. The approaches are based on simple image processing techniques, 3D rendering, and image diffusion models, and use object-centric data to synthesize realistic, cluttered images with varying contextual coherence and complexity. We assess how these methods enable models to achieve category-level generalization in real-world data, and demonstrate significant performance boosts within this data-constrained experimental setting.",

Inverse heat problems have wide-ranging uses, but a critical application lies in quantifying how building facade renovation reduces thermal transmittance, a key determinant of building energy efficiency. However, solving inverse heat problems with non-invasive data collected in situ is error-prone due to environmental variability or deviations from theoretically assumed conditions. Hence, current methods for measuring thermal conductivity are either invasive, require lengthy observation periods, or are sensitive to environmental and experimental conditions. Here, we present a PINN-based iterative framework to estimate the thermal conductivity k of a wall from a set of thermographs; our framework alternates between estimating the forward heat problem with a PINN for a fixed k, and optimizing k by comparing the thermographs and surface temperatures predicted by the PINN, repeating until the estimated k's convergence. Using both environmental data captured by a weather station and data generated from Finite-Volume-Method software simulations, we accurately predict k across different environmental conditions and data collection sampling times, given the temperature profile of the wall at dawn is close to steady state. Although violating the steady-state assumption impacts the accuracy of k's estimation, we show that our proposed framework still only exhibits a maximum MAE of 4.0851. Our work demonstrates the potential of PINN-based methods for reliable estimation of material properties in situ and under realistic conditions, without lengthy measurement campaigns. Given the lack of research on using machine learning, and more specifically on PINNs, for solving in-situ inverse problems, we expect our work to be a starting point for more research on the topic.",

In contrast, the width of ReLU networks must scale linearly with $m$ to interpolate, and they cannot simultaneously fit two lengths with different residues modulo $p$.

However, datasets containing suboptimal and fragmented trajectories present challenges for reward propagation, resulting in inaccurate value estimation and degraded policy performance. While trajectory stitching via generative models offers a promising solution, existing augmentation methods frequently produce trajectories that are either confined to the support of the behavior policy or violate the underlying dynamics, thereby limiting their effectiveness for policy improvement. We propose ASTRO, a data augmentation framework that generates distributionally novel and dynamics-consistent trajectories for offline RL. ASTRO first learns a temporal-distance representation to identify distinct and reachable stitch targets. We then employ a dynamics-guided stitch planner that adaptively generates connecting action sequences via Rollout Deviation Feedback, defined as the gap between target state sequence and the actual arrived state sequence by executing predicted actions, to improve trajectory stitching's feasibility and reachability. This approach facilitates effective augmentation through stitching and ultimately enhances policy learning. ASTRO outperforms prior offline RL augmentation methods across various algorithms, achieving notable performance gain on the challenging OGBench suite and demonstrating consistent improvements on standard offline RL benchmarks such as D4RL.",

Traditional neural networks often fail to detect out-of-domain (OOD) data and may output confident yet incorrect predictions. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) address this by providing probabilistic estimates, but incur high computational cost because predictions require sampling weight distributions and multiple forward passes. The Probabilistic Forward Pass (PFP) offers a highly efficient approximation to Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) by assuming Gaussian-distributed weights and activations, enabling fully analytic uncertainty propagation and replacing sampling with a single deterministic forward pass. We present an end-to-end pipeline for training, compiling, optimizing, and deploying PFP-based BNNs on embedded ARM CPUs. Using the TVM deep learning compiler, we implement a dedicated library of Gaussian-propagating operators for multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, combined with manual and automated tuning strategies. Ablation studies show that PFP consistently outperforms SVI in computational efficiency, achieving speedups of up to 4200x for small mini-batches. PFP-BNNs match SVI-BNNs on Dirty-MNIST in accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and OOD detection while greatly reducing compute cost. These results highlight the potential of combining Bayesian approximations with code generation to enable efficient BNN deployment on resource-constrained systems.",

Unlike conventional supervised fine-tuning, SuperIntelliAgent learns autonomously without annotation: the learner generates candidate outputs, the verifier evaluates them through step-by-step reasoning, and their interaction produces chosen/rejected pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This converts each input into a pseudo-training signal for continual improvement. The framework integrates dual-scale memory: short-term in-context memory that preserves reasoning traces across refinement cycles, and long-term memory that consolidates acquired knowledge through lightweight on-the-fly fine-tuning. A replay buffer retains samples that show verifiable progress and replays them as auxiliary supervision, reinforcing recent learning while forming adaptive curricula. SuperIntelliAgent is infrastructure-agnostic and can be plugged into existing agentic frameworks while turning ordinary inference loops into a lifelong optimization process. We posit that pairing a trainable learner with a reasoning-capable verifier forms a minimal reliable unit of growing intelligence, as paired feedback and partial-history replay yield richer learning curricula and stronger preference alignment. With a small number of automatically generated DPO pairs, the learner improves across all benchmarks, indicating that this mechanism provides a promising direction for continual intelligence accumulation and real-world deployment.",

Instead of relying on fixed keyboard inputs, our model allows users to control game video contents through natural language prompts, keyboard, or mouse signals, enabling flexible and semantically rich interaction within generated worlds. We formally defined the concept of interactive video data and developed an automated process to transform large-scale, unstructured text-video pairs into causally aligned interactive datasets. Built upon a 14B image-to-video Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) foundation model, our model incorporates a text-driven interaction injection mechanism for fine-grained control over camera motion, character behavior, and environment dynamics. We introduce an interaction-focused benchmark, InterBench, to evaluate interaction performance comprehensively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model generates temporally coherent and causally grounded interactive game videos that faithfully respond to diverse and free-form user instructions such as \"open the door\", \"draw a torch\", or \"trigger an explosion\".",

However, these models often fail to provide an explicit representation of motion separate from content, limiting their applicability for content creators. To address this gap, we propose DisMo, a novel paradigm for learning abstract motion representations directly from raw video data via an image-space reconstruction objective. Our representation is generic and independent of static information such as appearance, object identity, or pose. This enables open-world motion transfer, allowing motion to be transferred across semantically unrelated entities without requiring object correspondences, even between vastly different categories. Unlike prior methods, which trade off motion fidelity and prompt adherence, are overfitting to source structure or drifting from the described action, our approach disentangles motion semantics from appearance, enabling accurate transfer and faithful conditioning. Furthermore, our motion representation can be combined with any existing video generator via lightweight adapters, allowing us to effortlessly benefit from future advancements in video models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a diverse set of motion transfer tasks. Finally, we show that the learned representations are well-suited for downstream motion understanding tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art video representation models such as V-JEPA in zero-shot action classification on benchmarks including Something-Something v2 and Jester.

Our evaluation employs Proof-of-Vulnerability (PoV) test execution to concretely assess whether LLM-generated source code successfully patches vulnerabilities.

            "summary": "To support the circular economy, robotic systems must not only assemble new products but also disassemble end-of-life (EOL) ones for reuse, recycling, or safe disposal. Existing approaches to disassembly sequence planning often assume deterministic and fully observable product models, yet real EOL products frequently deviate from their initial designs due to wear, corrosion, or undocumented repairs. We argue that disassembly should therefore be formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which naturally captures uncertainty about the product's internal state. We present a mathematical formulation of disassembly as a POMDP, in which hidden variables represent uncertain structural or physical properties. Building on this formulation, we propose a task and motion planning framework that automatically derives specific POMDP models from CAD data, robot capabilities, and inspection results. To obtain tractable policies, we approximate this formulation with a reinforcement-learning approach that operates on stochastic action outcomes informed by inspection priors, while a Bayesian filter continuously maintains beliefs over latent EOL conditions during execution. Using three products on two robotic systems, we demonstrate that this probabilistic planning framework outperforms deterministic baselines in terms of average disassembly time and variance, generalizes across different robot setups, and successfully adapts to deviations from the CAD model, such as missing or stuck parts.",

Existing trackers trained on terrestrial data fail to generalize to these physics-driven degradations. We present MANTA, a physics-informed framework integrating representation learning with tracking design for underwater scenarios. We propose a dual-positive contrastive learning strategy coupling temporal consistency with Beer-Lambert augmentations to yield features robust to both temporal and underwater distortions. We further introduce a multi-stage pipeline augmenting motion-based tracking with a physics-informed secondary association algorithm that integrates geometric consistency and appearance similarity for re-identification under occlusion and drift. To complement standard IoU metrics, we propose Center-Scale Consistency (CSC) and Geometric Alignment Score (GAS) to assess geometric fidelity. Experiments on four underwater benchmarks (WebUOT-1M, UOT32, UTB180, UWCOT220) show that MANTA achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Success AUC by up to 6 percent, while ensuring stable long-term generalized underwater tracking and efficient runtime.",

Using hardware-in-the-loop architecture search under edge latency and memory constraints, we obtain a compact hybrid backbone that combines gated short convolutions with a small number of grouped query attention blocks, delivering up to 2x faster prefill and decode on CPUs compared to similarly sized models. The LFM2 family covers 350M-8.3B parameters, including dense models (350M, 700M, 1.2B, 2.6B) and a mixture-of-experts variant (8.3B total, 1.5B active), all with 32K context length. LFM2's training pipeline includes a tempered, decoupled Top-K knowledge distillation objective that avoids support mismatch; curriculum learning with difficulty-ordered data; and a three-stage post-training recipe of supervised fine-tuning, length-normalized preference optimization, and model merging. Pre-trained on 10-12T tokens, LFM2 models achieve strong results across diverse benchmarks; for example, LFM2-2.6B reaches 79.56% on IFEval and 82.41% on GSM8K. We further build multimodal and retrieval variants: LFM2-VL for vision-language tasks, LFM2-Audio for speech, and LFM2-ColBERT for retrieval. LFM2-VL supports tunable accuracy-latency tradeoffs via token-efficient visual processing, while LFM2-Audio separates audio input and output pathways to enable real-time speech-to-speech interaction competitive with models 3x larger. LFM2-ColBERT provides a low-latency encoder for queries and documents, enabling high-performance retrieval across multiple languages. All models are released with open weights and deployment packages for ExecuTorch, llama.cpp, and vLLM, making LFM2 a practical base for edge applications that need fast, memory-efficient inference and strong task capabilities.",

However, high network communication costs are always an impediment to split learning, especially for large foundation models that require transmitting large amounts of high-dimensional data. To resolve this issue, we present a new multimodal model structure that incorporates a learning-based data compression method, which compresses model embeddings into low-bit integers while preserving the model's performance, greatly reducing the transmission costs between partitions. We then determine the optimal number of discrete representation levels based on a solid theoretical foundation from entropy coding.",

However, developing AI-driven chatbots for this purpose requires large, high-quality question-and-answer (Q&A) datasets, which are typically expensive and resource-intensive to produce, especially for low-resource languages like Persian. In this paper, we introduce MegaChat, the first fully synthetic Persian Q&A dataset designed to evaluate intelligent sales chatbots in Telegram-based e-commerce. We propose a novel, automated multi-agent architecture that generates persona-aware Q&A pairs by collecting data from active Telegram shopping channels. The system employs specialized agents for question generation, validation, and refinement, ensuring the production of realistic and diverse conversational data. To evaluate answer generation, we compare three classic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models with our advanced agentic system, which features multi-query retrieval, reranking, and persona-aligned response synthesis. Using GPT-5.1 for evaluation across six quality dimensions, our results show that the agentic architecture outperformed traditional RAG models in 4 out of 5 diverse channels, demonstrating its ability to generate scalable, high-quality datasets without relying on expensive human annotation or complex fine-tuning. MegaChat provides SMEs with an efficient, cost-effective solution for building intelligent customer engagement systems in specialized commercial domains, enabling advancements in multilingual conversational AI for low-resource languages.

(ICML 2024, pp. 8762-8781) who proposed an approach that uses a prefix of the arrival sequence as a sample to determine whether the predictions are close to the true arrival sequence and then either follows the predictions or uses a known baseline algorithm that ignores the predictions and is $β$-competitive. Their analysis is limited to the case that the optimal matching has size $n$, i.e., every online vertex can be matched. We generalize their approach and analysis by removing any assumptions on the size of the optimal matching while only requiring that the size of the predicted matching is at least $αn$ for any constant $0 < α\\le 1$. Our learning-augmented algorithm achieves $(1-o(1))$-consistency and $(β-o(1))$-robustness. Additionally, we show that the competitive ratio degrades smoothly between consistency and robustness with increasing prediction error.",

Previous research predominantly attempts to address this in a dual encoder paradigm, e.g., utilizing the separate encoders for understanding and generation respectively or balancing semantic representations and low-level features with contrastive loss. In this paper, we propose VQRAE, a Vector Quantization version of Representation AutoEncoders, which pioneers the first exploration in unified representation to produce Continuous semantic features for image understanding and Discrete tokens for visual generation within a unified tokenizer. Specifically, we build upon pretrained vision foundation models with a symmetric ViT decoder and adopt a two-stage training strategy: first, it freezes the encoder and learns a high-dimensional semantic VQ codebook with pixel reconstruction objective; then jointly optimizes the encoder with self-distillation constraints. This design enables negligible semantic information for maintaining the ability of multimodal understanding, discrete tokens that are compatible for generation and fine-grained reconstruction. Besides, we identify the intriguing property in quantizing semantic encoders that rely on high-dimensional codebook in contrast to the previous common practice of low-dimensional codebook in image reconstruction. The semantic VQ codebook can achieve a 100% utilization ratio at a dimension of 1536. VQRAE presents competitive performance on several benchmarks of visual understanding, generation and reconstruction with promising scaling property in the autoregressive paradigm for its discrete merits.",

Existing benchmarks mainly focus on the binary detection of generated images or the localization of manually edited regions and do not reflect the properties of diffusion-based edits, which often blend smoothly into the original content. We present Diffusion-Based Image Editing Area Localization Dataset (DEAL-300K), a large scale dataset for diffusion-based image manipulation localization (DIML) with more than 300,000 annotated images. We build DEAL-300K by using a multi-modal large language model to generate editing instructions, a mask-free diffusion editor to produce manipulated images, and an active-learning change detection pipeline to obtain pixel-level annotations. On top of this dataset, we propose a localization framework that uses a frozen Visual Foundation Model (VFM) together with Multi Frequency Prompt Tuning (MFPT) to capture both semantic and frequency-domain cues of edited regions. Trained on DEAL-300K, our method reaches a pixel-level F1 score of 82.56% on our test split and 80.97% on the external CoCoGlide benchmark, providing strong baselines and a practical foundation for future DIML research.The dataset can be accessed via https://github.com/ymhzyj/DEAL-300K.",

While fine-tuning is effective for adapting these multimodal language models (MLMs) to downstream tasks, full fine-tuning is computationally expensive. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this by training only a small portion of model weights. However, MLMs are difficult to interpret, making it challenging to identify which components are most effective for training to balance efficiency and performance. We propose an attention-based interpretability method for MLMs by analyzing attention scores relative to image tokens. The core idea is to identify attention heads that focus on image key objects. We utilize this information to select optimal model components for PEFT in multimodal models. Our contributions include a method for identifying attention heads associated with image key objects, its application to PEFT for image captioning, and the creation of a new dataset containing images, key object masks, and their textual descriptions. We conducted experiments on MLMs with 2-3 billion parameters to validate the method's effectiveness. By calculating Head Impact (HI) scores we quantify an attention head's focus on key objects, indicating its significance in image understanding. Our fine-tuning experiments demonstrate that adapting layers with the highest HI scores leads to the most significant shifts in metrics compared to pre-trained, randomly selected, or lowest-HI-score layers. This indicates that fine-tuning a small percentage (around 0.01%) of parameters in these crucial layers can substantially influence image understanding capabilities.",

Integrating bio-inspired design principles into linear actuators could bring forth the next generation of adaptive and energy efficient smart material-based actuation systems. The present study amalgamates the advantages of bipenniform architecture, which generates high force in the given physiological region and a high power-to-weight ratio of shape memory alloy (SMA), into a novel bio-inspired SMA-based linear actuator. A mathematical model of a multi-layered bipenniform configuration-based SMA actuator was developed and validated experimentally. The current research also caters to the incorporation of failure mitigation strategies using design failure mode and effects analysis along with the experimental assessment of the performance of the developed actuator. The system has been benchmarked against an industry-developed stepper motor-driven actuator. It has shown promising results generating an actuation force of 257 N with 15 V input voltage, meeting the acceptable range for actuation operation. It further exhibits about 67% reduction in the weight of the drive mechanism, with 80% lesser component, 32% cost reduction, and 19% energy savings and similar envelope dimensions for assembly compatibility with dampers and louvers for easy onsite deployment. The study introduces SMA coil-based actuator as an advanced design that can be deployed for high force-high stroke applications. The bio-inspired SMA-based linear actuator has applications ranging from building automation controls to lightweight actuation systems for space robotics and medical prosthesis.",

To complement for the lack of data diversity, we introduce a novel and scalable simulation framework capable of synthesizing massive unseen states upon existing driving logs. Our pipeline utilizes advanced neural rendering with a reactive environment to generate high-fidelity multi-view observations controlled by the perturbed ego trajectory. Furthermore, we develop a pseudo-expert trajectory generation mechanism for these newly simulated states to provide action supervision. Upon the synthesized data, we find that a simple co-training strategy on both real-world and simulated samples can lead to significant improvements in both robustness and generalization for various planning methods on challenging real-world benchmarks, up to +6.8 EPDMS on navhard and +2.9 on navtest. More importantly, such policy improvement scales smoothly by increasing simulation data only, even without extra real-world data streaming in. We further reveal several crucial findings of such a sim-real learning system, which we term SimScale, including the design of pseudo-experts and the scaling properties for different policy architectures.

Our method employs a hierarchical detection framework combining YOLOv11 for accurate monitor and region of interest (ROI) localisation with PaddleOCR for robust text extraction. To enhance reliability across variable camera angles and lighting conditions, a geometric rectification module standardizes the screen perspective before character recognition. We evaluated the system on a dataset of 6,498 images collected from open-source corpora and real-world intensive care units in Vietnam. The model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@50-95) of 99.5% for monitor detection and 91.5% for vital sign ROI localisation. The end-to-end extraction accuracy exceeded 98.9% for core physiological parameters, including heart rate, oxygen saturation SpO2, and arterial blood pressure.

In this work, we introduce the concept of distributed dynamic associative memory (DDAM), which extends classical AM to settings with multiple agents and time-varying data streams. In DDAM, each agent maintains a local AM that must not only store its own associations but also selectively memorize information from other agents based on a specified interest matrix. To address this problem, we propose a novel tree-based distributed online gradient descent algorithm, termed DDAM-TOGD, which enables each agent to update its memory on the fly via inter-agent communication over designated routing trees. We derive rigorous performance guarantees for DDAM-TOGD, proving sublinear static regret in stationary environments and a path-length dependent dynamic regret bound in non-stationary environments. These theoretical results provide insights into how communication delays and network structure impact performance. Building on the regret analysis, we further introduce a combinatorial tree design strategy that optimizes the routing trees to minimize communication delays, thereby improving regret bounds. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed DDAM-TOGD framework achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to representative online learning baselines such as consensus-based distributed optimization, confirming the benefits of the proposed approach in dynamic, distributed environments.",

Rectified Flow enables one-step sampling by learning nearly straight probability paths, but achieving such straightness requires multiple computationally intensive reflow iterations. MeanFlow achieves one-step generation by directly modeling the average velocity over time; however, when trained on highly curved flows, it suffers from slow convergence and noisy supervision. To address these limitations, we propose Rectified MeanFlow, a framework that models the mean velocity field along the rectified trajectory using only a single reflow step. This eliminates the need for perfectly straightened trajectories while enabling efficient training. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective truncation heuristic that aims to reduce residual curvature and further improve performance. Extensive experiments on ImageNet at 64, 256, and 512 resolutions show that Re-MeanFlow consistently outperforms prior one-step flow distillation and Rectified Flow methods in both sample quality and training efficiency.

Although some neural-network-based solutions predict layout-level performance directly from netlists, they often face generalization challenges due to the black-box heuristics of commercial placement-and-routing tools, which create disparate data across designs. To this end, we propose ParaGate, a three-step cross-stage prediction framework that infers layout-level timing and power from netlists. First, we propose a two-phase transfer-learning approach to predict parasitic parameters, pre-training on mid-scale circuits and fine-tuning on larger ones to capture extreme conditions.

While language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating coherent and fluent text, the lack of interpretability presents a substantial obstacle. The limited interpretability of generated text significantly impacts its practical usability, particularly in knowledge-enhanced text generation tasks that necessitate reliability and explainability. Existing methods often employ domain-specific knowledge retrievers that are tailored to specific data characteristics, limiting their generalizability to diverse data types and tasks. To overcome this limitation, we directly leverage the two-tier architecture of structured knowledge, consisting of high-level entities and low-level knowledge triples, to design our task-agnostic structured knowledge hunter. Specifically, we employ a local-global interaction scheme for structured knowledge representation learning and a hierarchical transformer-based pointer network as the backbone for selecting relevant knowledge triples and entities. By combining the strong generative ability of language models with the high faithfulness of the knowledge hunter, our model achieves high interpretability, enabling users to comprehend the model output generation process. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both internal knowledge-enhanced table-to-text generation on the RotoWireFG dataset and external knowledge-enhanced dialogue response generation on the KdConv dataset. Our task-agnostic model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and corresponding language models, setting new standards on the benchmark.",

Although its full-context dependency, i.e., modeling all previous scales for next-scale prediction, facilitates more stable and comprehensive representation learning by leveraging complete information flow, the resulting computational inefficiency and substantial overhead severely hinder VAR's practicality and scalability. This motivates us to develop a new VAR model with better performance and efficiency without full-context dependency. To address this, we reformulate VAR as a non-full-context Markov process, proposing Markov-VAR. It is achieved via Markovian Scale Prediction: we treat each scale as a Markov state and introduce a sliding window that compresses certain previous scales into a compact history vector to compensate for historical information loss owing to non-full-context dependency. Integrating the history vector with the Markov state yields a representative dynamic state that evolves under a Markov process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Markov-VAR is extremely simple yet highly effective: Compared to VAR on ImageNet, Markov-VAR reduces FID by 10.5% (256 $\\times$ 256) and decreases peak memory consumption by 83.8% (1024 $\\times$ 1024).

In particular, we devise a set of basic requirements to be fulfilled by an energy to be considered as `perceptually inspired', showing that there is an explicit class of functionals satisfying all of them. We single out three explicit functionals that we consider of basic interest, showing similarities and differences with existing models. The minima of such functionals is computed using a gradient descent approach.

We revisit fully independent Q-learning (IQL) as a minimal decentralized testbed and run large-scale experiments across environment size L and agent density rho. We construct a phase map using two axes - the cooperative success rate (CSR) and a stability index derived from TD-error variance - revealing three distinct regimes: a coordinated and stable phase, a fragile transition region, and a jammed or disordered phase. A sharp double Instability Ridge separates these regimes and corresponds to persistent kernel drift, the time-varying shift of each agent's effective transition kernel induced by others' policy updates. Synchronization analysis further shows that temporal alignment is required for sustained cooperation, and that competition between drift and synchronization generates the fragile regime. Removing agent identifiers eliminates drift entirely and collapses the three-phase structure, demonstrating that small inter-agent asymmetries are a necessary driver of drift. Overall, the results show that decentralized MARL exhibits a coherent phase structure governed by the interaction between scale, density, and kernel drift, suggesting that emergent coordination behaves as a distribution-interaction-driven phase phenomenon.",

This gap limits our understanding of the properties of the gradient estimators and the associated optimization algorithms, thereby constraining opportunities to improve training stability and overall performance. In this work, we provide a unified theoretical framework that characterizes the statistical properties of commonly used policy-gradient estimators under mild assumptions. Our analysis establishes unbiasedness, derives exact variance expressions, and yields an optimization-loss upper bound that enables principled reasoning about learning dynamics. Building on these results, we prove convergence guarantees and derive an adaptive learning-rate schedule governed by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of gradients. We further show that the variance-optimal baseline is a gradient-weighted estimator, offering a new principle for variance reduction and naturally enhancing stability beyond existing methods. These insights motivate Optimal Baseline and Learning-Rate Policy Optimization (OBLR-PO), an algorithm that jointly adapts learning rates and baselines in a theoretically grounded manner.

The task aims to mimic human reasoning by extracting and fusing information from audio-visual scenes, with the main challenge being the identification of question-relevant cues from the complex audio-visual content. Existing methods fail to capture the structural information within video, and suffer from insufficient fine-grained modeling of multi-modal features. To address these issues, we are the first to introduce a new multi-modal scene graph that explicitly models the objects and their relationship as a visually grounded, structured representation of the audio-visual scene. Furthermore, we design a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network~(KAN)-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) to enhance the expressive power of the temporal integration stage. This enables more fine-grained modeling of cross-modal interactions within the question-aware fused audio-visual representation, leading to capture richer and more nuanced patterns and then improve temporal reasoning performance. We evaluate the model on the established MUSIC-AVQA and MUSIC-AVQA v2 benchmarks, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and model checkpoints will be publicly released.",

Egocentric frames are processed by a structured VLM prompt, embedded and matched against a curated database of validated scenarios, and mapped to joint-level impedance commands via inverse kinematics. We evaluate the system on tabletop manipulation tasks with and without human presence, including wiping, object handovers, and liquid pouring. The results show that the pipeline adapts stiffness, damping, and speed profiles in a context-aware manner, maintaining task success while improving safety.

Recent advances introduced per-primitive textures that incorporate spatial color variations within each Gaussian, improving their expressiveness. However, texture-based Gaussians parameterize appearance with a uniform per-Gaussian sampling grid, allocating equal sampling density regardless of local visual complexity. This leads to inefficient texture space utilization, where high-frequency regions are under-sampled and smooth regions waste capacity, causing blurred appearance and loss of fine structural detail. We introduce FACT-GS, a Frequency-Aligned Complexity-aware Texture Gaussian Splatting framework that allocates texture sampling density according to local visual frequency. Grounded in adaptive sampling theory, FACT-GS reformulates texture parameterization as a differentiable sampling-density allocation problem, replacing the uniform textures with a learnable frequency-aware allocation strategy implemented via a deformation field whose Jacobian modulates local sampling density. Built on 2D Gaussian Splatting, FACT-GS performs non-uniform sampling on fixed-resolution texture grids, preserving real-time performance while recovering sharper high-frequency details under the same parameter budget.",

Traditional analysis methods often struggle with these issues, motivating the need for more robust, data-driven approaches. This dissertation explores deep learning methodologies to improve the analysis and visualization of spatio-temporal scientific ensembles, focusing on dimensionality reduction, flow estimation, and temporal interpolation. First, we address high-dimensional data representation through autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction for scientific ensembles. We evaluate the stability of projection metrics under partial labeling and introduce a Pareto-efficient selection strategy to identify optimal autoencoder variants, ensuring expressive and reliable low-dimensional embeddings. Next, we present FLINT, a deep learning model for high-quality flow estimation and temporal interpolation in both flow-supervised and flow-unsupervised settings. FLINT reconstructs missing velocity fields and generates high-fidelity temporal interpolants for scalar fields across 2D+time and 3D+time ensembles without domain-specific assumptions or extensive finetuning. To further improve adaptability and generalization, we introduce HyperFLINT, a hypernetwork-based approach that conditions on simulation parameters to estimate flow fields and interpolate scalar data. This parameter-aware adaptation yields more accurate reconstructions across diverse scientific domains, even with sparse or incomplete data. Overall, this dissertation advances deep learning techniques for scientific visualization, providing scalable, adaptable, and high-quality solutions for interpreting complex spatio-temporal ensembles.",

Author intent understanding plays a crucial role in interpreting social media content. This paper addresses author intent classification in Bangla social media posts by leveraging both textual and visual data. Recognizing limitations in previous unimodal approaches, we systematically benchmark transformer-based language models (mBERT, DistilBERT, XLM-RoBERTa) and vision architectures (ViT, Swin, SwiftFormer, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet), utilizing the Uddessho dataset of 3,048 posts spanning six practical intent categories. We introduce a novel intermediate fusion strategy that significantly outperforms early and late fusion on this task. Experimental results show that intermediate fusion, particularly with mBERT and Swin Transformer, achieves 84.11% macro-F1 score, establishing a new state-of-the-art with an 8.4 percentage-point improvement over prior Bangla multimodal approaches. Our analysis demonstrates that integrating visual context substantially enhances intent classification. Cross-modal feature integration at intermediate levels provides optimal balance between modality-specific representation and cross-modal learning.

However, limited and heterogeneous local datasets, as well as resource-constrained deployment, severely degrade both model generalization and resource utilization, leading to a compromised learning performance. Therefore, we propose a parameter-efficient FEEL framework that jointly leverages model pruning and client selection to tackle such challenges. First, we derive an information-theoretic generalization statement that characterizes the discrepancy between training and testing function losses and embed it into the convergence analysis. It reveals that a larger local generalization statement can undermine the global convergence. Then, we formulate a generalization-aware average squared gradient norm bound minimization problem, by jointly optimizing the pruning ratios, client selection, and communication-computation resources under energy and delay constraints. Despite its non-convexity, the resulting mixed-integer problem is efficiently solved via an alternating optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design achieves superior learning performance than state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of coupling generalization-aware analysis with system-level optimization for efficient FEEL.",

While classical models and recent foundation models (e.g., Chronos, TimesFM) incorporate covariates, they often lack the semantic reasoning to interpret the causal interplay between conflicting drivers. In this work, we propose a two-agent framework decoupling contextual interpretation from probabilistic forecasting. An LLM \"event interpreter\" processes heterogeneous signals-including school schedules, meteorological summaries, and reports-into a scalar transmission-impact signal. A neuro-symbolic core then combines this with historical case counts to produce calibrated probabilistic forecasts. We evaluate the framework on real-world HFMD datasets from Hong Kong (2023-2024) and Lishui, China (2024). Compared to traditional and foundation-model baselines, our approach achieves competitive point forecasting accuracy while providing robust 90% prediction intervals (coverage 0.85-1.00) and human-interpretable rationales. Our results suggest that structurally integrating domain knowledge through LLMs can match state-of-the-art performance while yielding context-aware forecasts that align with public health workflows.

Acquiring high-quality and high-resolution MR images can be time-consuming, posing a significant challenge when multiple sequences providing complementary contrast information are needed or when the patient is unable to remain in the scanner for an extended period of time. Reducing k-space measurements is a strategy to speed up acquisition, but often leads to reduced quality in reconstructed images. Additionally, in real-world MRI, both under-sampled and full-sampled images are prone to artefacts, and correcting these artefacts is crucial for maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning methods have been proposed to restore image quality from under-sampled data, while others focused on the correction of artefacts that result from the noise or motion. No approach has however been proposed so far that addresses both acceleration and artefacts correction, limiting the performance of these models when these degradation factors occur simultaneously. To address this gap, we present a method for recovering high-quality images from under-sampled data with simultaneously correction for noise and motion artefact called USArt (Under-Sampling and Artifact correction model). Customized for 2D brain anatomical images acquired with Cartesian sampling, USArt employs a dual sub-model approach. The results demonstrate remarkable increase of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast in the images restored. Various under-sampling strategies and degradation levels were explored, with the gradient under-sampling strategy yielding the best outcomes. We achieved up to 5x acceleration and simultaneously artefacts correction without significant degradation, showcasing the model's robustness in real-world settings.",

Existing approaches lack explainability and cross-domain generalization capabilities crucial for practical deployment. We present BanglaSentNet, an explainable hybrid deep learning framework integrating LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and BanglaBERT through dynamic weighted ensemble learning for multi-aspect sentiment classification. We introduce a dataset of 8,755 manually annotated Bangla product reviews across four aspects (Quality, Service, Price, Decoration) from major Bangladeshi e-commerce platforms. Our framework incorporates SHAP-based feature attribution and attention visualization for transparent insights. BanglaSentNet achieves 85% accuracy and 0.88 F1-score, outperforming standalone deep learning models by 3-7% and traditional approaches substantially. The explainability suite achieves 9.4/10 interpretability score with 87.6% human agreement. Cross-domain transfer learning experiments reveal robust generalization: zero-shot performance retains 67-76% effectiveness across diverse domains (BanglaBook reviews, social media, general e-commerce, news headlines); few-shot learning with 500-1000 samples achieves 90-95% of full fine-tuning performance, significantly reducing annotation costs. Real-world deployment demonstrates practical utility for Bangladeshi e-commerce platforms, enabling data-driven decision-making for pricing optimization, service improvement, and customer experience enhancement. This research establishes a new state-of-the-art benchmark for Bangla sentiment analysis, advances ensemble learning methodologies for low-resource languages, and provides actionable solutions for commercial applications.",

In contrast, humans leverage the metacognitive model with memory, enabling continuous strategy refinement through metacognitive control when faced with new challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose metacognitive test-time reasoning (MCTR), a framework that equips models with the ability to learn, adapt, and improve during test time through metacognitive self-updating. Inspired by the dual structure of human metacognition, MCTR comprises meta-level and object-level VLM reasoning modules, each equipped with dedicated memory systems for hierarchical adaptive reasoning. Specifically, MCTR consists of (1) a meta-reasoning module which incrementally builds a structured memory by discovering and storing task-relevant rules, environmental patterns, and action-outcome relationships from test-time observations as natural language descriptions; and (2) an action-reasoning module that determines optimal actions through context-aware perception and strategic reasoning by dynamically retrieving and integrating knowledge from memory. The action-reasoning module continuously updates its policy through proposed metacognitive test-time reinforcement learning, adapting as knowledge memory evolves. We evaluate MCTR on 45 Atari games (33 seen, 12 unseen). MCTR demonstrates robust test-time adaptation, achieving 9/12 top-1 results on unseen games compared with baselines. Analyses through ablations, learning dynamics, and case studies reveal the complementary contributions of both components and show meta-reasoning evolving toward human-like adaptation strategies.",

Informally, we show that Spectral Clustering works well as long as the smallest eigenvalues appear in groups well separated from the rest of the matrix representation's spectrum. This arises, for example, whenever there exists a hierarchy of clusters at different scales, a regime not captured by previous analyses. Our results are very general and can be applied beyond the traditional graph Laplacian. In particular, we study Hermitian representations of digraphs and show Spectral Clustering can recover partitions where edges between clusters are oriented mostly in the same direction. This has applications in, for example, the analysis of trophic levels in ecological networks. We demonstrate that our results accurately predict the performances of Spectral Clustering on synthetic and real-world data sets.",

However, it is challenging for these models to account for uncertainty associated with their predictions, because they directly output scalar values at each time step. To address such a challenge, we propose a novel model named interleaved dual-branch Probability Distribution Network (interPDN), which directly constructs discrete probability distributions per step instead of a scalar. The regression output at each time step is derived by computing the expectation of the predictive distribution on a predefined support set. To mitigate prediction anomalies, a dual-branch architecture is introduced with interleaved support sets, augmented by coarse temporal-scale branches for long-term trend forecasting. Outputs from another branch are treated as auxiliary signals to impose self-supervised consistency constraints on the current branch's prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of interPDN.",

However, recognizing targets under electronic countermeasures (ECM), especially the mainstream interrupted-sampling repeater jamming (ISRJ), remains a significant challenge, as HRRPs often suffer from serious feature distortion. To address this, we propose a robust HRRP recognition method guided by prior jamming information. Specifically, we introduce a point spread function (PSF) as prior information to model the HRRP distortion induced by ISRJ. Based on this, we design a recognition network that leverages this prior through a prior-guided feature interaction module and a hybrid loss function to enhance the model's discriminative capability. With the aid of prior information, the model can learn invariant features within distorted HRRP under different jamming parameters. Both the simulated and measured-data experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and exhibits stronger generalization capabilities when facing unseen jamming parameters.",

This challenge is magnified in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, where devices face stringent bandwidth, latency, and energy constraints. Conventional secure aggregation protocols, while essential for protecting model updates, frequently require multiple interaction rounds, large payload sizes, and per-client costs rendering them impractical for many edge deployments.\n  In this work, we present Hyb-Agg, a lightweight and communication-efficient secure aggregation protocol that integrates Multi-Key CKKS (MK-CKKS) homomorphic encryption with Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)-based additive masking. Hyb-Agg reduces the secure aggregation process to a single, non-interactive client-to-server transmission per round, ensuring that per-client communication remains constant regardless of the number of participants. This design eliminates partial decryption exchanges, preserves strong privacy under the RLWE, CDH, and random oracle assumptions, and maintains robustness against collusion by the server and up to $N-2$ clients.\n  We implement and evaluate Hyb-Agg on both high-performance and resource-constrained devices, including a Raspberry Pi 4, demonstrating that it delivers sub-second execution times while achieving a constant communication expansion factor of approximately 12x over plaintext size. By directly addressing the communication bottleneck, Hyb-Agg enables scalable, privacy-preserving federated learning that is practical for real-world IoT deployments.",

Accurate aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is essential for assessing carbon storage and wildfire fuel loads, yet traditional methods rely on labor-intensive field measurements or remote sensing approaches with significant limitations in dense vegetation. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based method for estimating AGB from a single ground-based RGB image. We frame this as a dense prediction task, introducing AGB density maps, where each pixel represents tree biomass normalized by the plot area and each tree's image area. We leverage the recently introduced synthetic 3D SPREAD dataset, which provides realistic forest scenes with per-image tree attributes (height, trunk and canopy diameter) and instance segmentation masks. Using these assets, we compute AGB via allometric equations and train a model to predict AGB density maps, integrating them to recover the AGB estimate for the captured scene. Our approach achieves a median AGB estimation error of 1.22 kg/m^2 on held-out SPREAD data and 1.94 kg/m^2 on a real-image dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first method to estimate aboveground biomass directly from a single RGB image, opening up the possibility for a scalable, interpretable, and cost-effective solution for forest monitoring, while also enabling broader participation through citizen science initiatives.",

While synthetic rendering is a promising solution, bridging the sim-to-real gap often requires expert intervention. In this work, we benchmark a range of domain randomization (DR) and domain adaptation (DA) techniques, including feature-based methods, generative AI (GenAI), and classical rendering approaches, for creating contextualized synthetic data without manual annotation. Our evaluation focuses on the effectiveness and efficiency of low-level and high-level feature alignment, as well as a controlled diffusion-based DA method guided by prompts generated from real-world contexts. We validate our methods on two datasets: a proprietary industrial dataset (automotive and logistics) and a public robotics dataset. Results show that if render-based data with enough variability is available as seed, simpler feature-based methods, such as brightness-based and perceptual hashing filtering, outperform more complex GenAI-based approaches in both accuracy and resource efficiency. Perceptual hashing consistently achieves the highest performance, with mAP50 scores of 98% and 67% on the industrial and robotics datasets, respectively. Additionally, GenAI methods present significant time overhead for data generation at no apparent improvement of sim-to-real mAP values compared to simpler methods. Our findings offer actionable insights for efficiently bridging the sim-to-real gap, enabling high real-world performance from models trained exclusively on synthetic data.",

However, transformer models often lack clear interpretability, and the success of transformers has not been well understood in theory. In this paper, we study the capability and interpretability of transformers in learning a family of classic statistical models, namely random walks on circles. We theoretically demonstrate that, after training with gradient descent, a one-layer transformer model can achieve optimal accuracy in predicting random walks. Importantly, our analysis reveals that the trained model is interpretable: the trained softmax attention serves as a token selector, focusing on the direct parent state; subsequently, the value matrix executes a one-step probability transition to predict the location of the next state based on this parent state. We also show that certain edge cases not covered by our theory are indeed failure cases, demonstrating that our theoretical conditions are tight. By investigating these success and failure cases, it is revealed that gradient descent with small initialization may fail or struggle to converge to a good solution in certain simple tasks even beyond random walks. Experiments are conducted to support our theoretical findings.",

We therefore conduct a comparison on a synthetic periodic dataset and real-world benchmarks, under varying missing rate. Latent-space attention consistently improves over a vanilla SDE-RNN. On the univariate UCR datasets, the LSTM-based time-varying feature model SDE-TVF-L achieves the highest average accuracy, raising mean performance by approximately 4, 6, and 10 percentage points over the baseline at 30%, 60% and 90% missingness, respectively (averaged across datasets). On multivariate UEA benchmarks, attention-augmented models again outperform the backbone, with SDE-TVF-L yielding up to a 7% gain in mean accuracy under high missingness.

Calibration of road networks in microsimulators to reproduce ephemeral phenomena such as traffic waves for large-scale simulation is a process that is fraught with challenges. This work reconsiders the existence of the traffic state data as boundary conditions on an ego vehicle moving through previously recorded traffic data, rather than reproducing those traffic phenomena in a calibrated microsim. Our approach is to autogenerate a 1 mile highway segment corresponding to I-24, and use the I-24 data to power a cosimulation module that injects traffic information into the simulation. The CARLA and cosimulation simulations are centered around an ego vehicle sampled from the empirical data, with autogeneration of \"visible\" traffic within the longitudinal range of the ego vehicle. Boundary control beyond these visible ranges is achieved using ghost cells behind (upstream) and ahead (downstream) of the ego vehicle. Unlike prior simulation work that focuses on local car-following behavior or abstract geometries, our framework targets full time-space diagram fidelity as the validation objective. Leveraging CARLA's rich sensor suite and configurable vehicle dynamics, we simulate wave formation and dissipation in both low-congestion and high-congestion scenarios for qualitative analysis. The resulting emergent behavior closely mirrors that of real traffic, providing a novel cosimulation framework for evaluating traffic control strategies, perception-driven autonomy, and future deployment of wave mitigation solutions. Our work bridges microscopic modeling with physical experimental data, enabling the first perceptually realistic, boundary-driven simulation of empirical traffic wave phenomena in CARLA.",

Targeting ten tourism-centric subdomains-Ganga Aarti, Cruise, Food Court, Public Toilet, Kund, Museum, General, Ashram, Temple and Travel, the work addresses the absence of language-specific QA resources in Hindi for culturally nuanced applications. In this paper, a dataset comprising 7,715 Hindi QA pairs pertaining to Varanasi tourism was constructed and subsequently augmented with 27,455 pairs generated via Llama zero-shot prompting. We propose a framework leveraging foundation models-BERT and RoBERTa, fine-tuned using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to optimize parameter efficiency and task performance. Multiple variants of BERT, including pre-trained languages (e.g., Hindi-BERT), are evaluated to assess their suitability for low-resource domain-specific QA. Evaluation metrics - F1, BLEU, and ROUGE-L - highlight trade-offs between answer precision and linguistic fluency. Experiments demonstrate that LoRA-based fine-tuning achieves competitive performance (85.3\\% F1) while reducing trainable parameters by 98\\% compared to SFT, striking a balance between efficiency and accuracy. Comparative analysis across models reveals that RoBERTa with SFT outperforms BERT variants in capturing contextual nuances, particularly for culturally embedded terms (e.g., Aarti, Kund). This work establishes a foundational baseline for Hindi tourism QA systems, emphasizing the role of LORA in low-resource settings and underscoring the need for culturally contextualized NLP frameworks in the tourism domain.",

To address these limitations, we propose a training-free inference-time method to enhance Multilingual Reasoning capabilities via Representation Engineering (MRRE) without using any additional training data or tools. MRRE sequentially injects two precomputed vectors at specific layers during inference processing: cross-lingual reasoning enhancement vectors, which steer non-English reasoning representations toward English space to unlock multilingual reasoning, and target-language output anchoring vectors, which restore the distribution of the target language to preserve input-output language consistency. Comprehensive experiments across six advanced LLMs and LVLMs on four reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MRRE consistently enhances non-English reasoning by an average gain of 5.48% and up to 7.54% in low-resource languages (Thai and Swahili), while improving input-output language consistency by 3.78%.",

This loss of precision is a critical bottleneck for tasks such as point cloud registration. We propose PointCNN++, a novel architectural design that fundamentally mitigates this precision-performance trade-off. It \\textbf{generalizes sparse convolution from voxels to points}, treating voxel-based convolution as a specialized, degraded case of our more general point-based convolution. First, we introduce a point-centric convolution where the receptive field is centered on the original, high-precision point coordinates. Second, to make this high-fidelity operation performant, we design a computational strategy that operates \\textbf{natively} on points. We formulate the convolution on native points as a Matrix-Vector Multiplication and Reduction (MVMR) problem, for which we develop a dedicated, highly-optimized GPU kernel. Experiments demonstrate that PointCNN++ \\textbf{uses an order of magnitude less memory and is several times faster} than representative point-based methods. Furthermore, when used as a simple replacement for the voxel-based backbones it generalizes, it \\textbf{significantly improves point cloud registration accuracies while proving both more memory-efficient and faster}. PointCNN++ shows that preserving geometric detail and achieving high performance are not mutually exclusive, paving the way for a new class of 3D learning with high fidelity and efficiency.

We demonstrate that extreme outliers are a data-independent, mechanically-produced artifact of training, originating from specific structural properties of the weight matrices (i.e., colinearity). Based on this insight, we propose TWEO (Transformers Without Extreme Outliers), a novel, non-invasive loss function. TWEO effectively prevents extreme outliers via a very simple loss term, which reduces outliers from 10000+ to less than 20. TWEO then enables full-model FP8 pre-training with neither engineering tricks nor architectural changes for both LLM and ViT. When standard FP8 training catastrophically collapses, TWEO achieves performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while delivering a 36% increase in training throughput. Also, TWEO enables a new quantization paradigm. Hardware-friendly W8A8 per-tensor static quantization of LLMs, previously considered completely unusable due to outliers, achieves SOTA performance for the first time on TWEO-trained models.",

Nonstabilizerness is a fundamental resource for quantum advantage, and efficient SRE estimations are highly beneficial in practical applications. We address the nonstabilizerness estimation problem through three supervised learning formulations starting from easier classification tasks to the more challenging regression task. Experimental results show that the proposed GNN manages to capture meaningful features from the graph-based circuit representation, resulting in robust generalization performances achieved across diverse scenarios. In classification tasks, the GNN is trained on product states and generalizes on circuits evolved under Clifford operations, entangled states, and circuits with higher number of qubits. In the regression task, the GNN significantly improves the SRE estimation on out-of-distribution circuits with higher number of qubits and gate counts compared to previous work, for both random quantum circuits and structured circuits derived from the transverse-field Ising model. Moreover, the graph representation of quantum circuits naturally integrates hardware-specific information. Simulations on noisy quantum hardware highlight the potential of the proposed GNN to predict the SRE measured on quantum devices.",

Existing detectors often suffer from missed detections and false positives in such scenarios. To address these issues, we propose DAONet-YOLOv8, an enhanced YOLOv8 variant with three key improvements: (1) a Dual-Attention Fusion Module (DAFM) that combines convolutional local feature extraction with self-attention based global context modeling to focus on subtle lesion regions while suppressing background noise; (2) an occlusion-aware detection head (Detect-OAHead) that learns the relationship between visible and occluded parts to compensate for missing lesion features; and (3) a C2f-DSConv module employing dynamic synthesis convolutions with multiple kernel shapes to better capture irregular lesion boundaries. Experiments on our real-world tea plantation dataset containing six pest and disease categories demonstrate that DAONet-YOLOv8 achieves 92.97% precision, 92.80% recall, 97.10% mAP@50 and 76.90% mAP@50:95, outperforming the YOLOv8n baseline by 2.34, 4.68, 1.40 and 1.80 percentage points respectively, while reducing parameters by 16.7%.

We argue that, compared to solely pursuing a perfect scene representation, it is more critical to enhance the robustness of the rasterization process against parameter errors to ensure stable camera pose tracking. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages a smooth kernel strategy to enhance the robustness of 3DGS-based SLAM. Unlike conventional methods that focus solely on minimizing rendering error, our core insight is to make the rasterization process more resilient to imperfections in the 3DGS parameters. We hypothesize that by allowing each Gaussian to influence a smoother, wider distribution of pixels during rendering, we can mitigate the detrimental effects of parameter noise from outlier Gaussians. This approach intentionally introduces a controlled blur to the rendered image, which acts as a regularization term, stabilizing the subsequent pose optimization. While a complete redesign of the rasterization pipeline is an ideal solution, we propose a practical and effective alternative that is readily integrated into existing 3DGS frameworks. Our method, termed Corrective Blurry KNN (CB-KNN), adaptively modifies the RGB values and locations of the K-nearest neighboring Gaussians within a local region. This dynamic adjustment generates a smoother local rendering, reducing the impact of erroneous GS parameters on the overall image. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach, while maintaining the overall quality of the scene reconstruction (mapping), significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of camera pose tracking.",

More specifically, given the high data and computation requirements of tabular instruction tuning, we aim to address the possibility of instruction tuning for tabular data generation with limited data and computational resources. To achieve this, we first create a high-quality instruction dataset for tabular data, enabling efficient LLM comprehension. We then instruction-tune an open-source LLM (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct) on the training set of this dataset to improve its tabular data generation performance.

In this context, we propose a pose-agnostic, zero-shot quality inspection framework that compares real scenes against real-time Digital Twins (DT) in the RGB-D space. Our approach enables efficient real-time DT rendering by semantically describing industrial scenes through object detection and pose estimation of known Computer-Aided Design models. We benchmark tools for real-time, multimodal RGB-D DT creation while tracking consumption of computational resources. Additionally, we provide an extensible and hierarchical annotation strategy for multi-criteria defect detection, unifying pose labelling with logical and structural defect annotations. Based on an automotive use case featuring the quality inspection of an axial flux motor, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our results demonstrate detection performace, achieving intersection-over-union (IoU) scores of up to 63.3% compared to ground-truth masks, even if using simple distance measurements under semi-controlled industrial conditions.

In this paper, we develop a asymptotic theory for variable importance defined as the difference in pinball loss risks. We first establish the asymptotic normality of the QRF estimator by handling the non-differentiable pinball loss via Knight's identity. Second, we uncover a \"phase transition\" phenomenon governed by the subsampling rate $β$ (where $s \\asymp n^β$). We prove that in the bias-dominated regime ($β\\ge 1/2$), which corresponds to large subsample sizes typically favored in practice to maximize predictive accuracy, standard inference breaks down as the estimator converges to a deterministic bias constant rather than a zero-mean normal distribution. Finally, we derive the explicit analytic form of this asymptotic bias and discuss the theoretical feasibility of restoring valid inference via analytic bias correction. Our results highlight a fundamental trade-off between predictive performance and inferential validity, providing a theoretical foundation for understanding the intrinsic limitations of random forest inference in high-dimensional settings.",

However, these high-performing models can easily exceed a billion parameters and produce high-dimensional embeddings, thus limiting their applicability for research or clinical use when computing resources are tight. Here, we introduce Pathryoshka, a multi-teacher distillation framework inspired by RADIO distillation and Matryoshka Representation Learning to reduce pathology FM sizes while allowing for adaptable embedding dimensions. We evaluate our framework with a distilled model on ten public pathology benchmarks with varying downstream tasks. Compared to its much larger teachers, Pathryoshka reduces the model size by 86-92% at on-par performance. It outperforms state-of-the-art single-teacher distillation models of comparable size by a median margin of 7.0 in accuracy. By enabling efficient local deployment without sacrificing accuracy or representational richness, Pathryoshka democratizes access to state-of-the-art pathology FMs for the broader research and clinical community.",

Nevertheless, its very high error rate has thwarted its general adoption. Moreover, recent undervolting accelerators rely on 8-bit arithmetic and cannot compete with state-of-the-art low-precision (<8b) architectures. To overcome these issues, we propose a new technique called Guarded Aggressive underVolting (GAV), which combines the ideas of undervolting and bit-serial computation to create a flexible approximation method based on aggressively lowering the supply voltage on a select number of least significant bit combinations. Based on this idea, we implement GAVINA (GAV mIxed-precisioN Accelerator), a novel architecture that supports arbitrary mixed precision and flexible undervolting, with an energy efficiency of up to 89 TOP/sW in its most aggressive configuration. By developing an error model of GAVINA, we show that GAV can achieve an energy efficiency boost of 20% via undervolting, with negligible accuracy degradation on ResNet-18.",

Malware experts seek to categorize and classify incoming samples to confirm their trustworthiness or prove their maliciousness. One of the ways in which groups of malware samples can be identified is through malware clustering. Despite the efforts of the community, malware clustering which incorporates benign samples has been under-explored. Moreover, despite the availability of larger public benchmark malware datasets, malware clustering studies have avoided fully utilizing these datasets in their experiments, often resorting to small datasets with only a few families. Additionally, the current state-of-the-art solutions for malware clustering remain unclear. In our study, we evaluate malware clustering quality and establish the state-of-the-art on Bodmas and Ember - two large public benchmark malware datasets. Ours is the first study of malware clustering performed on whole malware benchmark datasets. Additionally, we extend the malware clustering task by incorporating benign samples. Our results indicate that incorporating benign samples does not significantly degrade clustering quality. We find that there are significant differences in the quality of the created clusters between Ember and Bodmas, as well as a private industry dataset. Contrary to popular opinion, our top clustering performers are K-Means and BIRCH, with DBSCAN and HAC falling behind.",

However, its practical application is hindered by a critical limitation, i.e., insufficient fault tolerance against observational faults. Such faults, which appear as perturbations in the vehicles' perceived data, can substantially compromise the performance of MARL-based driving systems. Addressing this problem presents two primary challenges. One is to generate adversarial perturbations that effectively stress the policy during training, and the other is to equip vehicles with the capability to mitigate the impact of corrupted observations. To overcome the challenges, we propose a fault-tolerant MARL method for cooperative on-ramp vehicles incorporating two key agents. First, an adversarial fault injection agent is co-trained to generate perturbations that actively challenge and harden the vehicle policies. Second, we design a novel fault-tolerant vehicle agent equipped with a self-diagnosis capability, which leverages the inherent spatio-temporal correlations in vehicle state sequences to detect faults and reconstruct credible observations, thereby shielding the policy from misleading inputs. Experiments in a simulated highway merging scenario demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline MARL approaches, achieving near-fault-free levels of safety and efficiency under various observation fault patterns.",

In this paper, we renovate the pipeline of image-to-3D scene generation by unlocking the potential of geometry models and present our GeoWorld. Instead of exploiting geometric information obtained from a single-frame input, we propose to first generate consecutive video frames and then take advantage of the geometry model to provide full-frame geometry features, which contain richer information than single-frame depth maps or camera embeddings used in previous methods, and use these geometry features as geometrical conditions to aid the video generation model. To enhance the consistency of geometric structures, we further propose a geometry alignment loss to provide the model with real-world geometric constraints and a geometry adaptation module to ensure the effective utilization of geometry features. Extensive experiments show that our GeoWorld can generate high-fidelity 3D scenes from a single image and a given camera trajectory, outperforming prior methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

To bridge this gap, we present UNOGrasp, a learning-based vision-language model capable of performing visually-grounded obstruction reasoning to infer the sequence of actions needed to unobstruct the path and grasp the target object. We devise a novel multi-step reasoning process based on obstruction paths originated by the target object. We anchor each reasoning step with obstruction-aware visual cues to incentivize reasoning capability. UNOGrasp combines supervised and reinforcement finetuning through verifiable reasoning rewards. Moreover, we construct UNOBench, a large-scale dataset for both training and benchmarking, based on MetaGraspNetV2, with over 100k obstruction paths annotated by humans with obstruction ratios, contact points, and natural-language instructions. Extensive experiments and real-robot evaluations show that UNOGrasp significantly improves obstruction reasoning and grasp success across both synthetic and real-world environments, outperforming generalist and proprietary alternatives.

To address these limitations, we employ reasoning-based generation to output both the quadruple and a natural language rationale under element prefixes within a unified template, encouraging explicit relational reasoning and interpretability. To further enhance element-wise alignment, we introduce a listwise preference optimization framework for improving structural validity and relational coherence. Specifically, we generate element-wise confusable candidates via syntactic and semantic proximity, then train the model with listwise objectives to prefer the gold candidates over closely competing alternatives.

In this paper, we propose generative Video Prior based 3D Editing (ViP3DE) to employ the temporal consistency priors from pre-trained video generation models for multi-view consistent 3D editing in a single forward pass. Our key insight is to condition the video generation model on a single edited view to generate other consistent edited views for 3D updating directly, thereby bypassing the iterative editing paradigm. Since 3D updating requires edited views to be paired with specific camera poses, we propose motion-preserved noise blending for the video model to generate edited views at predefined camera poses. In addition, we introduce geometry-aware denoising to further enhance multi-view consistency by integrating 3D geometric priors into video models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed ViP3DE can achieve high-quality 3D editing results even within a single forward pass, significantly outperforming existing methods in both editing quality and speed.",

Recent studies have shown that aligning individual text tokens with specific image patches or regions enhances fine-grained compositional understanding. However, it remains challenging to capture compositional semantics that span multiple image regions. To address this limitation, we propose PowerCLIP, a novel contrastive pre-training framework enhanced by powerset alignment, which exhaustively optimizes region-to-phrase alignments by minimizing the loss defined between powersets of image regions and textual parse trees. Since the naive powerset construction incurs exponential computational cost due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of region subsets, we introduce efficient non-linear aggregators (NLAs) that reduce complexity from O(2^M) to O(M) with respect to the number of regions M, while approximating the exact loss value with arbitrary precision. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PowerCLIP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks, underscoring the compositionality and robustness of our approach.

We introduce EEG2ERP, a novel uncertainty-aware autoencoder approach that maps an arbitrary number of EEG trials to their associated ERP. To account for the ERP uncertainty we use bootstrapped training targets and introduce a separate variance decoder to model the uncertainty of the estimated ERP. We evaluate our approach in the challenging zero-shot scenario of generalizing to new subjects considering three different publicly available data sources; i) the comprehensive ERP CORE dataset that includes over 50,000 EEG trials across six ERP paradigms from 40 subjects, ii) the large P300 Speller BCI dataset, and iii) a neuroimaging dataset on face perception consisting of both EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We consistently find that our method in the few trial regime provides substantially better ERP estimates than commonly used conventional and robust averaging procedures. EEG2ERP is the first deep learning approach to map EEG signals to their associated ERP, moving toward reducing the number of trials necessary for ERP research.

Consequently, there is an urgent need for efficient and truly explainable image forensic methods. Recent detection paradigms have shifted towards explainable forensics. However, state-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on post-hoc rationalizations or visual discrimination, lacking a verifiable chain of evidence. This reliance on surface-level pattern matching limits the generation of causally grounded explanations and often results in poor generalization. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce \\textbf{REVEAL-Bench}, the first reasoning-enhanced multimodal benchmark for AI-generated image detection that is explicitly structured around a chain-of-evidence derived from multiple lightweight expert models, then records step-by-step reasoning traces and evidential justifications. Building upon this dataset, we propose \\textbf{REVEAL} (\\underline{R}easoning-\\underline{e}nhanced Forensic E\\underline{v}id\\underline{e}nce \\underline{A}na\\underline{l}ysis), an effective and explainable forensic framework that integrates detection with a novel expert-grounded reinforcement learning. Our reward mechanism is specially tailored to jointly optimize detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and logical coherence grounded in explicit forensic evidence, enabling REVEAL to produce fine-grained, interpretable, and verifiable reasoning chains alongside its detection outcomes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that REVEAL significantly enhances detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and robust cross-model generalization, benchmarking a new state of the art for explainable image forensics.",

However, existing VTG models assume that a relevant segment always exists, causing them to always predict a target segment even when the query is irrelevant to the video. While recent approaches attempt to handle irrelevant queries, they can only reject those that are entirely unrelated to the video and still fail to handle hard-irrelevant queries that are semantically similar but not actually relevant. To address this, we propose Refusal-Aware Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RA-RFT) to effectively refuse hard-irrelevant queries in VTG. Our method is based on the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework and integrates four reward objectives-format, refuse-IoU, explain, and query correction-to improve both relevance discrimination and fine-grained semantic reasoning. In addition, to effectively support RA-RFT, we construct a Hard-Irrelevant VTG (HI-VTG) dataset, which includes hard-irrelevant queries and their refusal answers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various relevance-aware VTG scenarios, including hard-irrelevant VTG, simply-shuffled RA-VTG, and human-annotated RA-VTG settings. We also show that the proposed method is scalable by applying it to various LVLM-based VTG models. Our code is available at https://github.com/JINSUBY/RA-RFT.",

Specifically, our framework first performs a global affine transformation to correct perspective distortions arising from the camera's viewpoint, then rectifies geometric deformations resulting from physical paper curling and folding, and finally employs a content-aware iterative process to eliminate fine-grained content distortions. To address limitations in existing evaluation protocols, we also propose two enhanced metrics: layout-aligned OCR metrics (AED/ACER) for a stable assessment that decouples geometric rectification quality from the layout analysis errors of OCR engines, and masked AD/AAD (AD-M/AAD-M) tailored for accurately evaluating geometric distortions in documents with incomplete boundaries.

This research highlights the role of P2P trading in efficient energy distribution and its synergy with advanced optimization techniques. While traditional rule-based methods perform well under stable conditions, they struggle in dynamic environments. To address this, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), is combined with community/distributed P2P trading mechanisms. By incorporating auction-based market clearing, a price advisor agent, and load and battery management, the approach achieves significant improvements. Results show that, compared to baseline models, DQN reduces electricity costs by 14.2% in Ireland and 5.16% in Finland, while increasing electricity revenue by 7.24% and 12.73%, respectively. PPO achieves the lowest peak hour demand, reducing it by 55.5% in Ireland, while DQN reduces peak hour demand by 50.0% in Ireland and 27.02% in Finland. These improvements are attributed to both MARL algorithms and P2P energy trading, which together results in electricity cost and peak hour demand reduction, and increase electricity selling revenue.

However, most existing text-to-video models rely solely on textual conditions, lacking general fine-grained controllability over video generation. To address this challenge, we propose InstanceV, a video generation framework that enables i) instance-level control and ii) global semantic consistency. Specifically, with the aid of proposed Instance-aware Masked Cross-Attention mechanism, InstanceV maximizes the utilization of additional instance-level grounding information to generate correctly attributed instances at designated spatial locations. To improve overall consistency, We introduce the Shared Timestep-Adaptive Prompt Enhancement module, which connects local instances with global semantics in a parameter-efficient manner. Furthermore, we incorporate Spatially-Aware Unconditional Guidance during both training and inference to alleviate the disappearance of small instances. Finally, we propose a new benchmark, named InstanceBench, which combines general video quality metrics with instance-aware metrics for more comprehensive evaluation on instance-level video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstanceV not only achieves remarkable instance-level controllability in video generation, but also outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in both general quality and instance-aware metrics across qualitative and quantitative evaluations.",

Using DAC, a state-of-the-art neural audio codec as our base, we demonstrate that raw EEG can be mapped into the codec's stride-based framing, enabling direct reuse of the audio-pretrained encoder-decoder. Even without modification, this setup yields stable EEG reconstructions, and fine-tuning on EEG data further improves fidelity and generalization compared to training from scratch. We systematically explore compression-quality trade-offs by varying residual codebook depth, codebook (vocabulary) size, and input sampling rate. To capture spatial dependencies across electrodes, we propose DAC-MC, a multi-channel extension with attention-based cross-channel aggregation and channel-specific decoding, while retaining the audio-pretrained initialization. Evaluations on the TUH Abnormal and Epilepsy datasets show that the adapted codecs preserve clinically relevant information, as reflected in spectrogram-based reconstruction loss and downstream classification accuracy.",

We present the first automated discovery of production-ready laser dicing processes on an industrial LASER1205 dicing system. We formulate the problem as a high-dimensional, constrained multi-objective Bayesian optimization task, and introduce a sequential two-level fidelity strategy to minimize expensive destructive die-strength evaluations. On bare silicon and product wafers, our method autonomously delivers feasible configurations that match or exceed expert baselines in production speed, die strength, and structural integrity, using only technician-level operation. Post-hoc validation of different weight configurations of the utility functions reveals that multiple feasible solutions with qualitatively different trade-offs can be obtained from the final surrogate model. Expert-refinement of the discovered process can further improve production speed while preserving die strength and structural integrity, surpassing purely manual or automated methods.",

Test-time expansion methods such as Tree-of-Thought (ToT) and Graph-of-Thought (GoT) enhance reasoning by introducing intermediate reasoning structures, tree search, or graph-based exploration mechanisms. However, their reasoning strategies suffer from limited diversity, redundant search branches, and inadequate integration and error correction across heterogeneous reasoning paths. To address these limitations, we propose a novel reasoning framework called Multi-chain Graph Refinement & Selection (MGRS), which first generates multiple diverse reasoning trajectories for a given problem, refines candidate responses using a composite self- and cross-verification strategy, then constructs a reasoning relation graph and estimates the success rate of intermediate nodes, and finally computes cumulative success rates to select the most reliable answer and corresponding reasoning trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that MGRS significantly advances both the reasoning capability and computational efficiency of reasoning enhancement methods. Across six benchmark datasets spanning four distinct tasks, MGRS achieves an average accuracy of 82.9%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by a clear margin of 2.1%. Remarkably, on the 24-point game, MGRS attains 100% accuracy for the first time, while delivering a 13.6x speed-up compared to the leading Forest of Thoughts framework.",

Recent works have advanced this field by representing camera poses as ray-based conditions, yet they often lack sufficient scene understanding and geometric awareness. DualCamCtrl specifically targets this limitation by introducing a dual-branch framework that mutually generates camera-consistent RGB and depth sequences. To harmonize these two modalities, we further propose the Semantic Guided Mutual Alignment (SIGMA) mechanism, which performs RGB-depth fusion in a semantics-guided and mutually reinforced manner. These designs collectively enable DualCamCtrl to better disentangle appearance and geometry modeling, generating videos that more faithfully adhere to the specified camera trajectories. Additionally, we analyze and reveal the distinct influence of depth and camera poses across denoising stages and further demonstrate that early and late stages play complementary roles in forming global structure and refining local details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DualCamCtrl achieves more consistent camera-controlled video generation, with over 40\\% reduction in camera motion errors compared with prior methods.

DNA-Prior integrates (i) an implicit architectural prior, enforced through a deep network parameterisation, with (ii) an explicit spectral-spatial prior composed of a frequency-domain fidelity term and a spatial regularisation functional. This dual-domain formulation yields a well-structured optimisation problem that jointly preserves global frequency characteristics and local anatomical structure, without requiring any external training data or modality-specific tuning.

We synthesised the results by summarising discrimination and calibration performance statistics and evaluated study quality by examining risk of bias and clinical utility.\n  Results We identified 38 studies reporting the development and validation of 40 models. Most studies reported Area Under the Curve (AUC) as the discrimination statistic with a range of 0.68-0.99. Only eight studies reported calibration performance, and three studies reported external validation. 31 studies had a high risk of bias, mainly in the analysis domain, and three studies had low risk of bias. The overall clinical utility of violence prediction models is poor, as indicated by risks of overfitting due to small samples, lack of transparent reporting, and low generalisability.\n  Conclusion Although black box machine learning models currently have limited applicability in clinical settings, they may show promise for identifying high-risk individuals. We recommend five key considerations for violence prediction modelling: (i) ensuring methodological quality (e.g. following guidelines) and interdisciplinary collaborations; (ii) using black box algorithms only for highly complex data; (iii) incorporating dynamic predictions to allow for risk monitoring; (iv) developing more trustworthy algorithms using explainable methods; and (v) applying causal machine learning approaches where appropriate.",

Although recent advances have leveraged the knowledge encoded in pre-trained visual models, their effectiveness is constrained by the \"affective gap\" , limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for IEC tasks. It has been demonstrated in psychology that language exhibits high variability, encompasses diverse and abundant information, and can effectively eliminate the \"affective gap\". Inspired by this, we propose a novel Affective Captioning for Image Emotion Classification (ACIEC) to classify image emotion based on pure texts, which effectively capture the affective information in the image. In our method, a hierarchical multi-level contrastive loss is designed for detecting emotional concepts from images, while an emotional attribute chain-of-thought reasoning is proposed to generate affective sentences. Then, a pre-trained language model is leveraged to synthesize emotional concepts and affective sentences to conduct IEC. Additionally, a contrastive loss based on semantic similarity sampling is designed to solve the problem of large intra-class differences and small inter-class differences in affective datasets. Moreover, we also take the images with embedded texts into consideration, which were ignored by previous studies. Extensive experiments illustrate that our method can effectively bridge the affective gap and achieve superior results on multiple benchmarks.",

The imbalance stems from the inherent variation in sparsity across attention heads and the irregular distribution of dense blocks within the sparse mask, when sequence parallelism is applied along the head dimension (as in Ulysses) or the block dimension (as in Ring Attention). In this paper, we formalize a sparse imbalance ratio to quantify the imbalance, and propose db-SP, a sparsity-aware sequence parallelism technique that tackles the challenge. db-SP contains a dual-level partitioning approach that achieves near-perfect workload balance at both the head and block levels with negligible overhead. Furthermore, to handle the evolving sparsity patterns across denoising steps and layers, db-SP dynamically determines the parallel degrees for the head and block dimensions at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that db-SP delivers an end-to-end speedup of 1.25x and an attention-specific speedup of 1.40x over state-of-the-art sequence parallel methods on average.

Existing benchmarks report strong overall performance but seldom isolate the role of the image modality, leaving open whether VLMs genuinely leverage visual understanding or merely depend on linguistic priors. To address this, we present MathSight, a university-level multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmark designed to disentangle and quantify the effect of visual input. Each problem includes multiple visual variants -- original, hand-drawn, photo-captured -- and a text-only condition for controlled comparison. Experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a consistent trend: the contribution of visual information diminishes with increasing problem difficulty. Remarkably, Qwen3-VL without any image input surpasses both its multimodal variants and GPT-5, underscoring the need for benchmarks like MathSight to advance genuine vision-grounded reasoning in future models.",

Thanks to a task-separated design, our approach supports zero-shot multi-condition editing, allowing users to specify multiple instructions in any order. To provide high-quality supervision, we synthesize precise training data from reliable sources, including high-fidelity rendering engines and DSLR cameras. Our Common Attribute Transform (CAT) dataset covers diverse attribute manipulations with accurate ground-truth scales, enabling NumeriKontrol to function as a simple yet powerful interactive editing studio. Extensive experiments show that NumeriKontrol delivers accurate, continuous, and stable scale control across a wide range of attribute editing scenarios.

Five models -- including GPT-4 and lightweight open-source alternatives -- are tested across three heterogeneous datasets (Essays, MyPersonality, Pandora) and two prompting strategies (minimal vs. enriched with linguistic and psychological cues). Enriched prompts reduce invalid outputs and improve class balance, but also introduce a systematic bias toward predicting trait presence. Performance varies substantially: Openness and Agreeableness are relatively easier to detect, while Extraversion and Neuroticism remain challenging. Although open-source models sometimes approach GPT-4 and prior benchmarks, no configuration yields consistently reliable predictions in zero-shot binary settings. Moreover, aggregate metrics such as accuracy and macro-F1 mask significant asymmetries, with per-class recall offering clearer diagnostic value. These findings show that current out-of-the-box LLMs are not yet suitable for APPT, and that careful coordination of prompt design, trait framing, and evaluation metrics is essential for interpretable results.",

Across two models and three tasks, we find that models whose self-grades determine rewards exhibit substantial grade inflation without corresponding accuracy gains, particularly on ambiguous tasks like summarization. Models that self-evaluate but do not control rewards show no such inflation.

Its performance was verified by conducting skin lesion detection experiments using images of skin lesions taken by actual users. Its accuracy and response time were measured using randomly sampled skin disease images. Results revealed that ENSEL achieved high recall in most images and less than 1s s processing speed.

Existing 3D-aware methods either depend on auxiliary 3D information or enhance RGB-only VLMs with geometry encoders through shallow feature fusion. We propose SpaceMind, a multimodal large language model explicitly designed for spatial reasoning solely from RGB inputs. The model adopts a dual-encoder architecture, integrating VGGT as a spatial understanding encoder and InternViT as a 2D visual encoder. The key idea is to treat the camera representation as an active guiding modality rather than passive metadata. Specifically, SpaceMind introduces a lightweight Camera-Guided Modality Fusion module before the language model to replace shallow fusion. It applies camera-conditioned biasing to spatial tokens, assigns query-independent weights reflecting their geometric importance, and uses the camera embedding to gate the fused representation. Empirically, SpaceMind establishes new state-of-the-art results on VSI-Bench, SQA3D and SPBench, surpassing both open and proprietary systems on VSI-Bench and SPBench by large margins and achieving state-of-the-art performance on SQA3D. These results demonstrate that camera-guided modality fusion is an effective and practical inductive bias for equipping VLMs with genuinely spatially grounded intelligence. We will release code and model checkpoints to support future research.",

However, simulation predictions depend on uncertain dark matter physics and baryonic modelling. Here, we present a method to constrain halo density profiles directly from observations using Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR), a technique that searches the space of analytic expressions for the function that best balances accuracy and simplicity for a given dataset. We test the approach on mock weak lensing excess surface density (ESD) data of synthetic clusters with NFW profiles. Motivated by real data, we assign each ESD data point a constant fractional uncertainty and vary this uncertainty and the number of clusters to probe how data precision and sample size affect model selection. For fractional errors around 5%, ESR recovers the NFW profile even from samples as small as 20 clusters. At higher uncertainties representative of current surveys, simpler functions are favoured over NFW, though it remains competitive. This preference arises because weak lensing errors are smallest in the outskirts, causing the fits to be dominated by the outer profile. ESR therefore provides a robust, simulation-independent framework both for testing mass models and determining which features of a halo's density profile are genuinely constrained by the data.",

Using 9,970 shots from StatsBomb's 2015-16 data and Football Manager 2017 ratings, we combine Bayesian logistic regression with informed priors to stabilise player-level estimates, especially for players with few shots. The hierarchical model reduces posterior uncertainty relative to weak priors and achieves strong external validity: hierarchical and baseline predictions correlate at R2 = 0.75, while an XGBoost benchmark validated against StatsBomb xG reaches R2 = 0.833. The model uncovers interpretable specialisation profiles, including one-on-one finishing (Aguero, Suarez, Belotti, Immobile, Martial), long-range shooting (Pogba), and first-touch execution (Insigne, Salah, Gameiro). It also identifies latent ability in underperforming players such as Immobile and Belotti. The framework supports counterfactual \"what-if\" analysis by reallocating shots between players under identical contexts. Case studies show that Sansone would generate +2.2 xG from Berardi's chances, driven largely by high-pressure situations, while Vardy-Giroud substitutions reveal strong asymmetry: replacing Vardy with Giroud results in a large decline (about -7 xG), whereas the reverse substitution has only a small effect (about -1 xG). This work provides an uncertainty-aware tool for player evaluation, recruitment, and tactical planning, and offers a general approach for domains where individual skill and contextual factors jointly shape performance.",

To address these gaps, we introduce the Bharat Scene Text Dataset (BSTD) - a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark for studying Indian Language Scene Text Recognition. It comprises more than 100K words that span 11 Indian languages and English, sourced from over 6,500 scene images captured across various linguistic regions of India. The dataset is meticulously annotated and supports multiple scene text tasks, including: (i) Scene Text Detection, (ii) Script Identification, (iii) Cropped Word Recognition, and (iv) End-to-End Scene Text Recognition. We evaluated state-of-the-art models originally developed for English by adapting (fine-tuning) them for Indian languages.

Existing approaches either synthesize missing modalities at high computational cost or apply prompt-based fine-tuning that relies only on adjacent-layer features and overlooks long-distance contextual information, which may offer additional tolerance to errors when one or more modalities are missing. To address this, we introduce REplay Prompting (REP): (1) construct modality-wise feature buffers via a residual bypass to cache early-layer representations and replay them in deeper layers, mitigating information loss as network depth increases; (2) employ a private-shared feature decoupling strategy, where private buffers preserve modality-specific signals and shared buffers encode cross-modal semantics; and (3) design a task-aware dynamic initialization mechanism to configure these buffers differently, improving stability and generalization under diverse missing-modality conditions. Experiments on vision-language, vision-language-audio, and temporal multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that REP consistently outperforms prior methods under both single- and multi-modality missing scenarios, while introducing only negligible parameter overhead. These results establish REP as a lightweight and effective paradigm for robust multimodal learning in challenging missing-modality environments.",

Pediatric hand radiographs often contain non-anatomical markers, and it is unclear whether inpainting these regions preserves features needed for bone age and gender prediction. To evaluate the clinical reliability of generative model-based inpainting for artifact removal, we used the RSNA Bone Age Challenge dataset, selecting 200 original radiographs and generating 600 inpainted versions with gpt-image-1 using natural language prompts to target non-anatomical artifacts. Downstream performance was assessed with deep learning ensembles for bone age estimation and gender classification, using mean absolute error (MAE) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) as metrics, and pixel intensity distributions to detect structural alterations. Inpainting markedly degraded model performance: bone age MAE increased from 6.26 to 30.11 months, and gender classification AUC decreased from 0.955 to 0.704. Inpainted images displayed pixel-intensity shifts and inconsistencies, indicating structural modifications not corrected by simple calibration. These findings show that, although visually realistic, foundation model-based inpainting can obscure subtle but clinically relevant features and introduce latent bias even when edits are confined to non-diagnostic regions, underscoring the need for rigorous, task-specific validation before integrating such generative tools into clinical AI workflows.",

This study adopted a human-in-the-loop framework and selected four passages from the medical canon Huangdi Neijing that are fundamental in theory. Through prompt-based cognitive scaffolding, DeepSeek V3.1 was guided to identify metaphor and metonymy in the source text and convey the theory in translation.

Human translations, baseline model translations, and prompt-adjusted translations were scored by the simulated readers across five cognitive dimensions, followed by structured interviews and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results show that the prompt-adjusted LLM translations perform best across all five dimensions, with high cross-model and cross-role consistency. The interview themes reveal differences between human and machine translation, effective strategies for metaphor and metonymy transfer, and readers' cognitive preferences.

To address this, we propose MindPower, a Robot-Centric framework integrating Perception, Mental Reasoning, Decision Making and Action. Given multimodal inputs, MindPower first perceives the environment and human states, then performs ToM Reasoning to model both self and others, and finally generates decisions and actions guided by inferred mental states. Furthermore, we introduce Mind-Reward, a novel optimization objective that encourages VLMs to produce consistent ToM Reasoning and behavior. Our model outperforms GPT-4o by 12.77% in decision making and 12.49% in action generation.",

In the context of 3D scene reconstruction from a set of images -- whether casually or professionally captured -- not all inputs contribute equally to the final output. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) enable photorealistic 3D reconstruction of scenes by optimizing a volumetric radiance field given a set of images. However, in-the-wild scenes often include image captures of varying quality, occlusions, and transient objects, resulting in uneven utility across inputs. In this paper we propose a method to quantify the individual contribution of each image to NeRF-based reconstructions of in-the-wild image sets. Contribution is assessed through reconstruction quality metrics based on PSNR and MSE. We validate our approach by removing low-contributing images during training and measuring the resulting impact on reconstruction fidelity.",

While existing methods perform well on visible regions, they inherently lack mechanisms to handle occluded interiors, resulting in incomplete textures and visible seams. To address this, we introduce an occlusion-aware texturing framework based on the concept of hit levels, which quantify the relative depth of mesh faces via multi-view ray casting. This allows us to partition mesh faces into ordered visibility layers, from outermost to innermost. We then apply a two-stage visibility control strategy that progressively reveals interior regions with structural coherence, followed by texturing each layer using a pretrained diffusion model. To seamlessly merge textures obtained across layers, we propose a soft UV-space blending technique that weighs each texture's contribution based on view-dependent visibility confidence. Empirical results demonstrate that GOATex consistently outperforms existing methods, producing seamless, high-fidelity textures across both visible and occluded surfaces. Unlike prior works, GOATex operates entirely without costly fine-tuning of a pretrained diffusion model and allows separate prompting for exterior and interior mesh regions, enabling fine-grained control over layered appearances.

However, recent dynamic Gaussian Splatting methods significantly degrade when only sparse input views are available, limiting their applicability in practice. The issue arises from the incoherent learning of 4D geometry as input views decrease. This paper presents GC-4DGS, a novel framework that infuses geometric consistency into 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), offering real-time and high-quality dynamic scene rendering from sparse input views. While learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and monocular depth estimators (MDEs) provide geometry priors, directly integrating these with 4DGS yields suboptimal results due to the ill-posed nature of sparse-input 4D geometric optimization. To address these problems, we introduce a dynamic consistency checking strategy to reduce estimation uncertainties of MVS across spacetime. Furthermore, we propose a global-local depth regularization approach to distill spatiotemporal-consistent geometric information from monocular depths, thereby enhancing the coherent geometry and appearance learning within the 4D volume. Extensive experiments on the popular N3DV and Technicolor datasets validate the effectiveness of GC-4DGS in rendering quality without sacrificing efficiency. Notably, our method outperforms RF-DeRF, the latest dynamic radiance field tailored for sparse-input dynamic view synthesis, and the original 4DGS by 2.62dB and 1.58dB in PSNR, respectively, with seamless deployability on resource-constrained IoT edge devices.",

Despite they provide a geometrically consistent way of treating complex domains, applying such architectures to parameterized dynamical systems for temporal prediction beyond the training data, i.e. the extrapolation regime, is still a challenging task due to the simultaneous need of temporal causality and generalizability in the parametric space. In this work, we explore the integration of graph convolutional autoencoders (GCAs) with tensor train (TT) decomposition and Operator Inference (OpInf) to develop a time-consistent reduced-order model. In particular, high-fidelity snapshots are represented as a combination of parametric, spatial, and temporal cores via TT decomposition, while OpInf is used to learn the evolution of the latter. Moreover, we enhance the generalization performance by developing a multi-fidelity two-stages approach in the framework of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet), treating the spatial and temporal cores as the trunk networks, and the parametric core as the branch network. Numerical results, including heat-conduction, advection-diffusion and vortex-shedding phenomena, demonstrate great performance in effectively learning the dynamic in the extrapolation regime for complex geometries, also in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches e.g. MeshGraphNets.",

To address these challenges, we propose Delta-XAI, which adapts 14 existing XAI methods through a wrapper function and introduces a principled evaluation suite for the online setting, assessing diverse aspects, such as faithfulness, sufficiency, and coherence. Experiments reveal that classical gradient-based methods, such as Integrated Gradients (IG), can outperform recent approaches when adapted for temporal analysis. Building on this, we propose Shifted Window Integrated Gradients (SWING), which incorporates past observations in the integration path to systematically capture temporal dependencies and mitigate out-of-distribution effects.

Existing approaches primarily rely on visual reconstruction objectives while neglecting physical priors, leading to sub-optimal performance in learning universal representations. To address these challenges, we propose a Universal Latent Action Learning framework that takes task instructions and multiple frames as inputs, and optimizes both future frame reconstruction and action sequence prediction. Unlike prior works, incorporating action predictions (e.g., gripper or hand trajectories and orientations) allows the model to capture richer physical priors such as real-world distances and orientations, thereby enabling seamless transferability to downstream tasks. We further decompose the latent actions into learnable motion and scene tokens to distinguish the robot's active movements from environmental changes, thus filtering out irrelevant dynamics. By distilling the learned latent actions into the latest VLA models, we achieve strong performance across both simulated (SIMPLER and LIBERO) and real-world robot settings. Notably, with only 10 real-world trajectories per task collected on a Franka robot, our approach successfully completes all five challenging tasks, demonstrating strong few-shot transferability in robotic manipulation.",

Yet, prevailing frameworks treat visual actions as optional tools, boosting metrics but leaving reasoning ungrounded and crops ineffective. This gap gives rise to the illusion of thinking with images: models seem visually grounded but rely on context-agnostic actions that neither refine perception nor guide reasoning toward correct answers. We address this problem by reframing visual actions as core reasoning primitives rather than optional tools, which we term visual rationalization, the visual analogue of textual Chain-of-Thought. Building on this insight, we propose Visual Rationale Learning (ViRL), an end-to-end paradigm that grounds training in the visual rationale itself. ViRL integrates (1) Process Supervision with ground-truth rationales, (2) Objective Alignment via step-level reward shaping, and (3) Fine-Grained Credit Assignment to distinguish correct, redundant, and erroneous actions. By ensuring each action contributes meaningfully to the reasoning chain, ViRL enables models to \"get the right answer for the right visual reason\". Trained purely with end-to-end RL, ViRL achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks spanning perception, hallucination, and reasoning. This work establishes visual rationalization as a task-agnostic, process-grounded paradigm for building transparent, verifiable, and trustworthy vision-language models.",

However, integrating 3DGS with SLAM systems faces a fundamental scalability limitation: methods are constrained by GPU memory capacity, restricting reconstruction to small-scale environments. We present DiskChunGS, a scalable 3DGS SLAM system that overcomes this bottleneck through an out-of-core approach that partitions scenes into spatial chunks and maintains only active regions in GPU memory while storing inactive areas on disk. Our architecture integrates seamlessly with existing SLAM frameworks for pose estimation and loop closure, enabling globally consistent reconstruction at scale. We validate DiskChunGS on indoor scenes (Replica, TUM-RGBD), urban driving scenarios (KITTI), and resource-constrained Nvidia Jetson platforms. Our method uniquely completes all 11 KITTI sequences without memory failures while achieving superior visual quality, demonstrating that algorithmic innovation can overcome the memory constraints that have limited previous 3DGS SLAM methods.",

Existing GR with SIDs works frame the probability of a sequence of SIDs corresponding to a user's interaction history using autoregressive modeling. While this has led to impressive next item prediction performances in certain settings, these autoregressive GR with SIDs models suffer from expensive inference due to sequential token-wise decoding, potentially inefficient use of training data and bias towards learning short-context relationships among tokens. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in NLP, we propose to instead model and learn the probability of a user's sequence of SIDs using masked diffusion. Masked diffusion employs discrete masking noise to facilitate learning the sequence distribution, and models the probability of masked tokens as conditionally independent given the unmasked tokens, allowing for parallel decoding of the masked tokens. We demonstrate through thorough experiments that our proposed method consistently outperforms autoregressive modeling. This performance gap is especially pronounced in data-constrained settings and in terms of coarse-grained recall, consistent with our intuitions. Moreover, our approach allows the flexibility of predicting multiple SIDs in parallel during inference while maintaining superior performance to autoregressive modeling.",

By adaptively down weighting unreliable GNSS measurements, our approach improves resilience positioning. The method is implemented in an extended GTSAM framework and evaluated on the UrbanNav dataset. The proposed solution reduces positioning errors by up to 41% relative to standard FGO, and achieves even larger improvements over extended Kalman filter (EKF) baselines in urban canyon environments.

Automated detection methods can significantly enhance efficiency and reduce costs; however, existing approaches still face several challenges, including low detection accuracy on imbalanced data, limited semantic extraction due to the use of a single encoder, and suboptimal performance in cross-domain transfer learning. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Transferable Software Requirement Conflict Detection Framework based on SBERT and SimCSE, termed TSRCDF-SS. First, the framework employs two independent encoders, Sentence-BERT (SBERT) and Simple Contrastive Sentence Embedding (SimCSE), to generate sentence embeddings for requirement pairs, followed by a six-element concatenation strategy. Furthermore, the classifier is enhanced by a two-layer fully connected feedforward neural network (FFNN) with a hybrid loss optimization strategy that integrates a variant of Focal Loss, domain-specific constraints, and a confidence-based penalty term. Finally, the framework synergistically integrates sequential and cross-domain transfer learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a 10.4% improvement in both macro-F1 and weighted-F1 scores in in-domain settings, and an 11.4% increase in macro-F1 in cross-domain scenarios.",

Given that hundreds of attack types are cataloged in the MITRE framework, training a separate monolithic predictor for each of them is infeasible. In this paper, we propose a modular framework for rapidly assembling online attack predictors from reusable components. The modular nature of a predictor facilitates controlling key metrics like timeliness and accuracy of prediction, as well as tuning the trade-off between them.

To bridge this gap, we introduce TIM-PRM (Tool-Integrated Multimodal PRM), a novel agentic framework that transforms verification from a passive classification task into an active, tool-augmented investigation. TIM-PRM is trained to explicitly plan verification strategies and utilizes a mechanism of Independent Question Asking to query evidence via external tools, effectively decoupling verification from the reasoning context to eliminate confirmation bias. We instantiate this method by curating a high-quality dataset of tool-integrated verification trajectories. Extensive experiments on VisualProcessBench demonstrate that our 8B parameter model surpasses existing open-source multimodal PRMs, significantly outperforming much larger models like Qwen2.5-72B and InternVL-78B, while offering interpretable insights into the verification process.",

However, multi-modal rendering that incorporates thermal infrared imagery remains largely underexplored. Existing approaches tend to neglect distinctive thermal characteristics, such as heat conduction and the Lambertian property. In this study, we introduce MrGS, a multi-modal radiance field based on 3DGS that simultaneously reconstructs both RGB and thermal 3D scenes. Specifically, MrGS derives RGB- and thermal-related information from a single appearance feature through orthogonal feature extraction and employs view-dependent or view-independent embedding strategies depending on the degree of Lambertian reflectance exhibited by each modality. Furthermore, we leverage two physics-based principles to effectively model thermal-domain phenomena. First, we integrate Fourier's law of heat conduction prior to alpha blending to model intensity interpolation caused by thermal conduction between neighboring Gaussians. Second, we apply the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the inverse-square law to formulate a depth-aware thermal radiation map that imposes additional geometric constraints on thermal rendering. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MrGS achieves high-fidelity RGB-T scene reconstruction while reducing the number of Gaussians.",

Recent studies have explored guidance mechanisms for unconditional generation, yet these approaches remain fundamentally tied to assumptions specific to diffusion models. In this work, we propose a spectrum-weakening framework for visual autoregressive (AR) models. This method works without the need for re-training, specific conditions, or any architectural modifications. It achieves this by constructing a controllable weak model in the spectral domain. We theoretically show that invertible spectral transformations preserve information, while selectively retaining only a subset of spectrum introduces controlled information reduction. Based on this insight, we perform spectrum selection along the channel dimension of internal representations, which avoids the structural constraints imposed by diffusion models. We further introduce two spectrum renormalization strategies that ensures numerical stability during the weakening process. Extensive experiments were conducted on both discrete and continuous AR models, with text or class conditioning. The results demonstrate that our method enables high-quality unconditional generation while maintaining strong prompt alignment for conditional generation.",

However, the existing benchmark datasets often focus on the generation with single or a few reference images, which prevents us from measuring the progress on how model performance advances or pointing out their weaknesses, under different multi-reference conditions. In addition, their task definitions are still vague, typically limited to axes such as \"what to edit\" or \"how many references are given\", and therefore fail to capture the intrinsic difficulty of multi-reference settings. To address this gap, we introduce $\\textbf{MultiBanana}$, which is carefully designed to assesses the edge of model capabilities by widely covering multi-reference-specific problems at scale: (1) varying the number of references, (2) domain mismatch among references (e.g., photo vs. anime), (3) scale mismatch between reference and target scenes, (4) references containing rare concepts (e.g., a red banana), and (5) multilingual textual references for rendering. Our analysis among a variety of text-to-image models reveals their superior performances, typical failure modes, and areas for improvement. MultiBanana will be released as an open benchmark to push the boundaries and establish a standardized basis for fair comparison in multi-reference image generation.

We conducted experiments on two established 2D segmentation networks and two public cardiac MR image datasets to validate the effectiveness of the CFF, and the experimental findings demonstrated a decrease in noise within the feature signal matrices.

            "summary": "Text-to-video (T2V) generation has achieved remarkable progress in producing high-quality videos aligned with textual prompts. However, aligning synthesized videos with nuanced human preference remains challenging due to the subjective and multifaceted nature of human judgment. Existing video preference alignment methods rely on costly human annotations or utilize proxy metrics to predict preference, which lacks the understanding of human preference logic. Moreover, they usually directly align T2V models with the overall preference distribution, ignoring potential conflict dimensions like motion dynamics and visual quality, which may bias models towards low-motion content. To address these issues, we present Motion-corrective alignment with Self-critic hierarchical Reasoning (McSc), a three-stage reinforcement learning framework for robust preference modeling and alignment. Firstly, Self-critic Dimensional Reasoning (ScDR) trains a generative reward model (RM) to decompose preferences into per-dimension assessments, using self-critic reasoning chains for reliable learning. Secondly, to achieve holistic video comparison, we introduce Hierarchical Comparative Reasoning (HCR) for structural multi-dimensional reasoning with hierarchical reward supervision. Finally, using RM-preferred videos, we propose Motion-corrective Direct Preference Optimization (McDPO) to optimize T2V models, while dynamically re-weighting alignment objective to mitigate bias towards low-motion content. Experiments show that McSc achieves superior performance in human preference alignment and generates videos with high-motion dynamic.",

The emerging semi-autoregressive (block diffusion) paradigm integrates the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive models, enabling arbitrary-length video generation and improving inference efficiency through KV caching and parallel sampling. However, it yet faces two enduring challenges: (i) KV-cache-induced long-horizon error accumulation, and (ii) the lack of fine-grained long-video benchmarks and coherence-aware metrics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BlockVid, a novel block diffusion framework equipped with semantic-aware sparse KV cache, an effective training strategy called Block Forcing, and dedicated chunk-wise noise scheduling and shuffling to reduce error propagation and enhance temporal consistency. We further introduce LV-Bench, a fine-grained benchmark for minute-long videos, complete with new metrics evaluating long-range coherence. Extensive experiments on VBench and LV-Bench demonstrate that BlockVid consistently outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, coherent minute-long videos. In particular, it achieves a 22.2% improvement on VDE Subject and a 19.4% improvement on VDE Clarity in LV-Bench over the state of the art approaches. Project website: https://ziplab.co/BlockVid.

To achieve illumination invariance, we propose a novel semantic SLAM framework with two designs. First, the Intrinsic Appearance Normalization (IAN) module proactively disentangles the scene's intrinsic properties, such as albedo, from transient lighting. By learning a standardized, illumination-invariant appearance model, it assigns a stable and consistent color representation to each Gaussian primitive. Second, the Dynamic Radiance Balancing Loss (DRB-Loss) reactively handles frames with extreme exposure. It activates only when an image's exposure is poor, operating directly on the radiance field to guide targeted optimization. This prevents error accumulation from extreme lighting without compromising performance under normal conditions. The synergy between IAN's proactive invariance and DRB-Loss's reactive correction endows our system with unprecedented robustness. Evaluations on public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in camera tracking, map quality, and semantic and geometric accuracy.",

To address this, we introduce Humanoid-LLA, a Large Language Action Model that maps expressive language commands to physically executable whole-body actions for humanoid robots. Our approach integrates three core components: a unified motion vocabulary that aligns human and humanoid motion primitives into a shared discrete space; a vocabulary-directed controller distilled from a privileged policy to ensure physical feasibility; and a physics-informed fine-tuning stage using reinforcement learning with dynamics-aware rewards to enhance robustness and stability. Extensive evaluations in simulation and on a real-world Unitree G1 humanoid show that Humanoid-LLA delivers strong language generalization while maintaining high physical fidelity, outperforming existing language-conditioned controllers in motion naturalness, stability, and execution success rate.",

To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical multimodal representation for 3D scene reasoning that explicitly aligns with VLMs at the input space by leveraging both multi-view images and text descriptions. The text descriptions capture spatial relationships by referencing the 3D coordinates of detected objects, while the multi-view images include a top-down perspective and four directional views (forward, left, right, and backward), ensuring comprehensive scene coverage. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical feature representation that aggregates patch-level image features into view-level and scene-level representations, enabling the model to reason over both local and global scene context. Experimental results on both situated 3D Q&A and general 3D Q&A benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

FUSE combines a global head, trained from pairwise distance-based comparisons to learn an anchor-free centrality score, with a local head, trained by denoising score matching to approximate a smoothed log-density potential. A single parameter between 0 and 1 interpolates between these calibrated signals, yielding depth-like centrality from different views via one forward pass.

We introduce SolarCHIP, a family of contrastively pretrained visual backbones tailored to multi-instrument SDO observations. SolarCHIP addresses three key challenges in solar imaging: multimodal sensing across AIA and HMI instruments, weak inter-class separability due to slow temporal evolution, and strong intra-class variability with sparse activity signals. Our pretraining framework employs a multi-granularity contrastive objective that jointly aligns (1) global class tokens across co-temporal AIA-HMI pairs to enhance temporal discrimination, (2) local patch tokens at fixed spatial indices to enforce position-consistent, modality-invariant features, and (3) intra-sample patches across different spatial locations to preserve fine-grained spatial structure. We train both CNN- and Vision Transformer-based autoencoders and demonstrate their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: cross-modal translation between HMI and AIA passbands via ControlNet, and full-disk flare classification. Experimental results show that SolarCHIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks, with particularly strong gains in low-resource settings where labeled data is limited. Ablation studies confirm that each contrastive component contributes essential discriminative capacity at different granularities. By publicly releasing pretrained weights and training code, we provide the heliophysics community with a practical, plug-and-play feature extractor that reduces computational requirements, improves label efficiency, and establishes a reusable foundation for diverse solar imaging applications.",

However, this success comes at the cost of increased model sizes which leads to additional computational burden. Mixture of Experts (MoEs) overcome this bottleneck by decoupling model capacity from computation by only activating a subset of parameters or \"experts\". However, these models require joint pretraining of these experts along with the router and do not model multi-step reasoning. In contrast, multi-agent frameworks improve reasoning by decomposing complex problems into modular subtasks. However, these frameworks rely on sequential \"plan--act--observe\" loops, which introduce significant latency. Our work, Comp-LLM, addresses these challenges by introducing a composable inference framework that enables cross-expert collaboration via an explicit sub-query dependency graph. Comp-LLM consists of three components: (1) A Sub-query Generator that decomposes an input query, assigns each sub-query to an appropriate expert using embedding similarity, and constructs a dependency graph; (2) A Query Executor that processes nodes in the graph and identifies opportunities for parallelism based on dependencies and resource constraints; and (3) A Response Aggregator that synthesizes intermediate expert responses into a coherent final answer. Across several benchmarks, Comp-LLM achieves up to 11.01% accuracy improvement over monolithic LLMs of similar size, while offering 1.67x--3.56x reduction in model size with no significant degradation relative to the largest model in its family.

This is due to robot embodiment diversity, appearance ambiguity, structural complexity, and rapid shape changes. Embracing these challenges, we introduce RobotSeg, a foundation model for robot segmentation in image and video.

These innovations collectively enable a structure-aware, automatic, and label-efficient solution.

While diffusion-based data generation methods show promise, they introduce inherent misalignment between generated images and semantic masks. This paper presents FLEX-Seg (FLexible Edge eXploitation for Segmentation), a framework that transforms this limitation into an opportunity for robust learning. FLEX-Seg comprises three key components: (1) Granular Adaptive Prototypes that captures boundary characteristics across multiple scales, (2) Uncertainty Boundary Emphasis that dynamically adjusts learning emphasis based on prediction entropy, and (3) Hardness-Aware Sampling that progressively focuses on challenging examples. By leveraging inherent misalignment rather than enforcing strict alignment, FLEX-Seg learns robust representations while capturing rich stylistic variations. Experiments across five real-world datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving 2.44% and 2.63% mIoU gains on ACDC and Dark Zurich. Our findings validate that adaptive strategies for handling imperfect synthetic data lead to superior domain generalization. Code is available at https://github.com/VisualScienceLab-KHU/FLEX-Seg.",

First, to handle spatially misaligned reference, we reformulate training as a self-supervised outpainting task that transforms diverse-layout reference into a unified occluded-input format. Second, to process partially visible reference, we design a reference extractor for comprehensive identity feature extraction. Further, we integrate hybrid reference fusion attention to handle varying resolutions and dynamic sequence lengths. Finally, from the perspective of generation quality, we introduce identity-robust pose control that decouples appearance from skeletal structure to mitigate pose overfitting, and a token replace strategy for coherent long-video generation.

In this paper, we propose DenoiseGS, the first framework to leverage the efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting for burst denoising. Our approach addresses two key challenges when applying feedforward Gaussian reconsturction model to noisy inputs: the degradation of Gaussian point clouds and the loss of fine details. To this end, we propose a Gaussian self-consistency (GSC) loss, which regularizes the geometry predicted from noisy inputs with high-quality Gaussian point clouds. These point clouds are generated from clean inputs by the same model that we are training, thereby alleviating potential bias or domain gaps. Additionally, we introduce a log-weighted frequency (LWF) loss to strengthen supervision within the spectral domain, effectively preserving fine-grained details. The LWF loss adaptively weights frequency discrepancies in a logarithmic manner, emphasizing challenging high-frequency details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DenoiseGS significantly exceeds the state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods on both burst denoising and novel view synthesis under noisy conditions, while achieving \\textbf{250$\\times$} faster inference speed.

Lagrangian neural surrogates such as GNS and SEGNN have emerged as strong alternatives by learning from particle-based simulations. However, these models typically operate with limited receptive fields, making them inaccurate for capturing the inherently global interactions in fluid flows. Motivated by this observation, we introduce Convolutional Residual Global Interactions (CORGI), a hybrid architecture that augments any GNN-based solver with a lightweight Eulerian component for global context aggregation. By projecting particle features onto a grid, applying convolutional updates, and mapping them back to the particle domain, CORGI captures long-range dependencies without significant overhead. When applied to a GNS backbone, CORGI achieves a 57% improvement in rollout accuracy with only 13% more inference time and 31% more training time. Compared to SEGNN, CORGI improves accuracy by 49% while reducing inference time by 48% and training time by 30%. Even under identical runtime constraints, CORGI outperforms GNS by 47% on average, highlighting its versatility and performance on varied compute budgets.",

While existing models have achieved notable success in ECG interpretation, they fail to leverage the interrelated nature of various cardiac abnormalities. Conversely, developing a specific model capable of extracting all relevant features for multiple ECG tasks remains a significant challenge. Large-scale foundation models, though powerful, are not typically pretrained on ECG data, making full re-training or fine-tuning computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose EnECG(Mixture of Experts-based Ensemble Learning for ECG Multi-tasks), an ensemble-based framework that integrates multiple specialized foundation models, each excelling in different aspects of ECG interpretation. Instead of relying on a single model or single task, EnECG leverages the strengths of multiple specialized models to tackle a variety of ECG-based tasks. To mitigate the high computational cost of full re-training or fine-tuning, we introduce a lightweight adaptation strategy: attaching dedicated output layers to each foundation model and applying Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) only to these newly added parameters. We then adopt a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to learn ensemble weights, effectively combining the complementary expertise of individual models. Our experimental results demonstrate that by minimizing the scope of fine-tuning, EnECG can help reduce computational and memory costs while maintaining the strong representational power of foundation models. This framework not only enhances feature extraction and predictive performance but also ensures practical efficiency for real-world clinical applications.

            "summary": "Matrix operations (e.g., inversion and singular value decomposition (SVD)) are fundamental in science and engineering. In many emerging real-world applications (such as wireless communication and signal processing), these operations must be performed repeatedly over matrices with parameters varying continuously. However, conventional methods tackle each matrix operation independently, underexploring the inherent low-rankness and continuity along the parameter dimension, resulting in significantly redundant computation. To address this challenge, we propose \\textbf{\\textit{Neural Matrix Computation Framework} (NeuMatC)}, which elegantly tackles general parametric matrix operation tasks by leveraging the underlying low-rankness and continuity along the parameter dimension. Specifically, NeuMatC unsupervisedly learns a low-rank and continuous mapping from parameters to their corresponding matrix operation results. Once trained, NeuMatC enables efficient computations at arbitrary parameters using only a few basic operations (e.g., matrix multiplications and nonlinear activations), significantly reducing redundant computations. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the promising performance of NeuMatC, exemplified by over $3\\times$ speedup in parametric inversion and $10\\times$ speedup in parametric SVD compared to the widely used NumPy baseline in wireless communication, while maintaining acceptable accuracy.",

These are subject to historical change and their analysis requires expertise in art history. In this article, we investigate which aspects of emotional expression can be detected by current (2025) vision language models (VLMs). We present a case study of three VLMs (Llava-Llama and two Qwen models) in which we ask these models four sets of questions of increasing complexity about artworks (general content, emotional content, expression of emotions, and emotion symbols) and carry out a qualitative expert evaluation. We find that the VLMs recognize the content of the images surprisingly well and often also which emotions they depict and how they are expressed. The models perform best for concrete images but fail for highly abstract or highly symbolic images. Reliable recognition of symbols remains fundamentally difficult. Furthermore, the models continue to exhibit the well-known LLM weakness of providing inconsistent answers to related questions.",

One critical but understudied aspect is the \\textbf{potential risk} situations, where the risk is \\textbf{not yet observable} but can be inferred from subtle precursors, such as anomalous behaviors or commonsense violations. Recognizing these precursors requires strong semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities, which are often absent in current AV systems due to the scarcity of such cases in existing driving or risk-centric datasets. Moreover, current autonomous driving accident datasets often lack annotations of the causal reasoning chains behind incidents, which are essential for identifying potential risks before they become observable. To address these gaps, we introduce PotentialRiskQA, a novel vision-language dataset designed for reasoning about potential risks prior to observation. Each sample is annotated with structured scene descriptions, semantic precursors, and inferred risk outcomes. Based on this dataset, we further propose PR-Reasoner, a vision-language-model-based framework tailored for onboard potential risk reasoning. Experimental results show that fine-tuning on PotentialRiskQA enables PR-Reasoner to significantly enhance its performance on the potential risk reasoning task compared to baseline VLMs. Together, our dataset and model provide a foundation for developing autonomous systems with improved foresight and proactive safety capabilities, moving toward more intelligent and resilient AVs.",

In our scheme, a set of fixed ODNNs, trained on simulated datasets, is incorporated into the experimental optical path to actively correct random distortions induced by dynamic scattering media. Experimental validation using rotating single-layer and double-layer ground glass confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, our scheme can also be combined with physics-prior-based reconstruction algorithms, enabling high-quality imaging under undersampled conditions. This work demonstrates a novel strategy for imaging through dynamic scattering media, which can be extended to other imaging systems.",

This research aimed to benchmark and advance semi-supervised learning (SSL) as a solution for this data scarcity problem. We organized the 2nd Semi-supervised Teeth Segmentation (STS 2024) Challenge at MICCAI 2024. We provided a large-scale dataset comprising over 90,000 2D images and 3D axial slices, which includes 2,380 OPG images and 330 CBCT scans, all featuring detailed instance-level FDI annotations on part of the data. The challenge attracted 114 (OPG) and 106 (CBCT) registered teams. To ensure algorithmic excellence and full transparency, we rigorously evaluated the valid, open-source submissions from the top 10 (OPG) and top 5 (CBCT) teams, respectively. All successful submissions were deep learning-based SSL methods. The winning semi-supervised models demonstrated impressive performance gains over a fully-supervised nnU-Net baseline trained only on the labeled data. For the 2D OPG track, the top method improved the Instance Affinity (IA) score by over 44 percentage points. For the 3D CBCT track, the winning approach boosted the Instance Dice score by 61 percentage points. This challenge confirms the substantial benefit of SSL for complex, instance-level medical image segmentation tasks where labeled data is scarce. The most effective approaches consistently leveraged hybrid semi-supervised frameworks that combined knowledge from foundational models like SAM with multi-stage, coarse-to-fine refinement pipelines. Both the challenge dataset and the participants' submitted code have been made publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/ricoleehduu/STS-Challenge-2024), ensuring transparency and reproducibility.",

In this paper, we propose ViGG, a robust RGB-D registration method using mutual guidance. First, we solve clique alignment in a visual-geometric combination form, employing a geometric guidance design to suppress ambiguous cliques. Second, to mitigate accuracy degradation caused by noise in visual matches, we propose a visual-guided geometric matching method that utilizes visual priors to determine the search space, enabling the extraction of high-quality, noise-insensitive correspondences. This mutual guidance strategy brings our method superior robustness, making it applicable for various RGB-D registration tasks.

            "summary": "To interact effectively with humans in the real world, it is important for agents to understand language that describes the dynamics of the environment--that is, how the environment behaves--rather than just task instructions specifying \"what to do\". Understanding this dynamics-descriptive language is important for human-agent interaction and agent behavior. Recent work address this problem using a model-based approach: language is incorporated into a world model, which is then used to learn a behavior policy. However, these existing methods either do not demonstrate policy generalization to unseen games or rely on limiting assumptions. For instance, assuming that the latency induced by inference-time planning is tolerable for the target task or expert demonstrations are available. Expanding on this line of research, we focus on improving policy generalization from a language-conditioned world model while dropping these assumptions. We propose a model-based reinforcement learning approach, where a language-conditioned world model is trained through interaction with the environment, and a policy is learned from this model--without planning or expert demonstrations. Our method proposes Language-aware Encoder for Dreamer World Model (LED-WM) built on top of DreamerV3. LED-WM features an observation encoder that uses an attention mechanism to explicitly ground language descriptions to entities in the observation. We show that policies trained with LED-WM generalize more effectively to unseen games described by novel dynamics and language compared to other baselines in several settings in two environments: MESSENGER and MESSENGER-WM.To highlight how the policy can leverage the trained world model before real-world deployment, we demonstrate the policy can be improved through fine-tuning on synthetic test trajectories generated by the world model.",

To alleviate this, we present CORTEX (COmpositional Reasoning-aware TEXt-guided), a novel framework that integrates complementary textual cues to enhance change understanding. In addition to capturing cues from pixel-level differences, CORTEX utilizes scene-level textual knowledge provided by Vision Language Models (VLMs) to extract richer image text signals that reveal underlying compositional reasoning. CORTEX consists of three key modules: (i) an Image-level Change Detector that identifies low-level visual differences between paired images, (ii) a Reasoning-aware Text Extraction (RTE) module that use VLMs to generate compositional reasoning descriptions implicit in visual features, and (iii) an Image-Text Dual Alignment (ITDA) module that aligns visual and textual features for fine-grained relational reasoning. This enables CORTEX to reason over visual and textual features and capture changes that are otherwise ambiguous in visual features alone.",

However, current MPL methods are fundamentally limited by their optimization of a single, static point representation. This paradigm is inherently brittle, leads to overfitting on base classes, and generalizes poorly to novel or ambiguous categories. We challenge this point paradigm, proposing that robust generalization requires learning a semantic cloud (i.e., a distribution over the embedding space). To achieve this, we introduce Points-to-Clouds (P2C), a novel framework inspired by diffusion models that reframes prompt learning as a dynamic denoising task. At the core of P2C is a dual denoising mechanism: a Dynamic Prompt Denoising (DPD) mechanism perturbs text prompts with sophisticated, annealed noise to learn a smoother semantic landscape, while an auxiliary V-L Mapper denoising loss re-tasks the mapper as a denoising autoencoder. This forces the mapper to reconstruct clean visual prompts from noisy text inputs, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments across 11 datasets demonstrate that P2C consistently outperforms strong baselines. On the base-to-novel generalization benchmark, our method achieves a Harmonic Mean of 79.7%, representing a relative improvement of 1.4% over the baseline.

Multimodal MOT that integrates visible light and thermal infrared information is particularly essential for robust autonomous driving systems. However, effectively fusing these heterogeneous modalities is challenging. Simple strategies like concatenation or addition often fail to bridge the significant non-linear distribution gap between their feature representations, which can lead to modality conflicts and degrade tracking accuracy. Drawing inspiration from the connection between multimodal MOT and the iterative refinement in diffusion models, this paper proposes DM$^3$T, a novel framework that reformulates multimodal fusion as an iterative feature alignment process to generate accurate and temporally coherent object trajectories. Our approach performs iterative cross-modal harmonization through a proposed Cross-Modal Diffusion Fusion (C-MDF) module. In this process, features from both modalities provide mutual guidance, iteratively projecting them onto a shared, consistent feature manifold. This enables the learning of complementary information and achieves deeper fusion compared to conventional methods. Additionally, we introduce a plug-and-play Diffusion Refiner (DR) to enhance and refine the unified feature representation. To further improve tracking robustness, we design a Hierarchical Tracker that adaptively handles confidence estimation. DM$^3$T unifies object detection, state estimation, and data association into a comprehensive online tracking framework without complex post-processing. Extensive experiments on the VT-MOT benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves 41.7 HOTA, representing a 1.54% relative improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods.

In this context, optogenetics enables modulation of gene expression using light as an external input, allowing fine-tuning of protein levels to unlock dynamic metabolic control and regulation of cell growth. Optogenetic systems can be actuated by light intensity. However, relying solely on intensity-driven control (i.e., signal amplitude) may fail to properly tune optogenetic bioprocesses when the dose-response relationship (i.e., light intensity versus gene-expression strength) is steep. In these cases, tunability is effectively constrained to either fully active or fully repressed gene expression, with little intermediate regulation. Pulse-width modulation, a concept widely used in electronics, can alleviate this issue by alternating between fully ON and OFF light intensity within forcing periods, thereby smoothing the average response and enhancing process controllability. Naturally, optimizing pulse-width-modulated optogenetics entails a switching-time optimal control problem with a binary input over many forcing periods. While this can be formulated as a mixed-integer program on a refined time grid, the number of decision variables can grow rapidly with increasing time-grid resolution and number of forcing periods, compromising tractability. Here, we propose an alternative solution based on reinforcement learning. We parametrize control actions via the duty cycle, a continuous variable that encodes the ON-to-OFF switching time within each forcing period, thereby respecting the intrinsic binary nature of the light intensity.",

First, Semantic View Alignment (SVA) generates strong augmentations via cross-class patch replacement and enforces semantic consistency using weak augmentations. Second, Shortcut Suppression Regularization (SSR) maintains an adaptive prototype bank that aligns known classes while encouraging separation of potential novel ones. ClearGCD can be seamlessly integrated into parametric GCD approaches and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.",

Inspired by the Language of Thought Hypothesis, which posits that human reasoning operates over a symbolic, compositional mental language called Mentalese, we introduce a framework that trains models to reason in a similarly compact style. Mentalese encodes abstract reasoning as ultra-compressed, structured tokens, enabling models to solve complex problems with far fewer steps. To improve both efficiency and accuracy, we propose SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO), a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise solutions that stay correct, while still allowing longer reasoning when needed. Applied to Mentalese-aligned models, SLPO yields significantly higher compression rates by enabling concise reasoning that preserves the benefits of detailed thinking without the computational overhead. Across benchmarks including AIME 2024 and 2025, MinervaMath, OlympiadBench, Math500, and AMC, our ORION models produce reasoning traces with 4-16x fewer tokens, achieve up to 5x lower inference latency, and reduce training costs by 7-9x relative to the DeepSeek R1 Distilled model, while maintaining 90-98% of its accuracy. ORION also surpasses Claude and ChatGPT-4o by up to 5% in accuracy while maintaining 2x compression.

This study introduces a data-driven framework for modeling chaotic pedestrian movement using empirically observed trajectory data and supervised learning. Videos were recorded during both daytime and nighttime conditions to capture pedestrian dynamics under varying ambient and traffic contexts. Pedestrian trajectories were extracted through computer vision techniques, and behavioral chaos was quantified using four chaos metrics: Approximate Entropy and Lyapunov Exponent, each computed for both velocity and direction change. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was then applied to consolidate these indicators into a unified chaos score. A comprehensive set of individual, group-level, and contextual traffic features was engineered and used to train Random Forest and CatBoost regression models. CatBoost models consistently achieved superior performance. The best daytime PCA-based CatBoost model reached an R^2 of 0.8319, while the nighttime PCA-based CatBoost model attained an R^2 of 0.8574. SHAP analysis highlighted that features such as distance travel, movement duration, and speed variability were robust contributors to chaotic behavior. The proposed framework enables practitioners to quantify and anticipate behavioral instability in real-world settings. Planners and engineers can use chaos scores to identify high-risk pedestrian zones, apprise infrastructure improvements, and calibrate realistic microsimulation models. The approach also supports adaptive risk assessment in automated vehicle systems by capturing short-term motion unpredictability grounded in observable, interpretable features.",

In production, LoRA-based models are served at scale, creating multi-tenant environments with hundreds of adapters sharing a base model. However, state-of-the-art serving systems co-batch heterogeneous adapters without accounting for rank (size) variability, leading to severe performance skew, which ultimately requires adding more GPUs to satisfy service-level objectives (SLOs). Existing optimizations, focused on loading, caching, and kernel execution, ignore this heterogeneity, leaving GPU resources underutilized. We present LoRAServe, a workload-aware dynamic adapter placement and routing framework designed to tame rank diversity in LoRA serving. By dynamically rebalancing adapters across GPUs and leveraging GPU Direct RDMA for remote access, LoRAServe maximizes throughput and minimizes tail latency under real-world workload drift. Evaluations on production traces from Company X show that LoRAServe elicits up to 2$\\times$ higher throughput, up to 9$\\times$ lower TTFT, while using up to 50% fewer GPUs under SLO constraints compared to state-of-the-art systems.",

Demographic factors like age and gender significantly influence pedestrian vulnerability, yet real-time monitoring systems rarely capture this information. To address this gap, this study proposes a deep learning framework that classifies pedestrian age group and gender from far-view intersection footage using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), without relying on facial recognition or high-resolution imagery. The classification is structured as a unified six-class problem, distinguishing adult, teenager, and child pedestrians for both males and females, based on full-body visual cues. Video data was collected from three high-risk intersections in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Two CNN architectures were implemented: ResNet50, a deep convolutional neural network pretrained on ImageNet, and a custom lightweight CNN optimized for computational efficiency. Eight model variants explored combinations of pooling strategies and optimizers. ResNet50 with Max Pooling and SGD achieved the highest accuracy (86.19%), while the custom CNN performed comparably (84.15%) with fewer parameters and faster training. The model's efficient design enables real-time inference on standard surveillance feeds. For practitioners, this system provides a scalable, cost-effective tool to monitor pedestrian demographics at intersections using existing camera infrastructure. Its outputs can shape intersection design, optimize signal timing, and enable targeted safety interventions for vulnerable groups such as children or the elderly. By offering demographic insights often missing in conventional traffic data, the framework supports more inclusive, data-driven planning in mixed-traffic environments.",

They assume perception outputs are fully reliable, even in ambiguous or poorly observed scenes, leaving the planner without an explicit measure of uncertainty. To address this limitation, we propose a camera-only E2E framework that estimates aleatoric uncertainty directly in BEV space and incorporates it into planning. Our method produces a dense, uncertainty-aware drivability map that captures both semantic structure and geometric layout at pixel-level resolution. To further promote safe and rule-compliant behavior, we introduce a lane-following regularization that encodes lane structure and traffic norms. This prior stabilizes trajectory planning under normal conditions while preserving the flexibility needed for maneuvers such as overtaking or lane changes. Together, these components enable robust and interpretable trajectory planning, even under challenging uncertainty conditions. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering substantial gains on both the challenging NAVHARD and NAVSAFE subsets. These results demonstrate that our principled aleatoric uncertainty modeling combined with driving priors significantly advances the safety and reliability of camera-only E2E autonomous driving.",

Existing methods face two key challenges: 1) the semantic prior gap due to the lack of descriptive text annotations in gesture datasets, and 2) the difficulty in achieving coordinated multimodal control over gesture generation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces CoordSpeaker, a comprehensive framework that enables coordinated caption-empowered co-speech gesture synthesis. Our approach first bridges the semantic prior gap through a novel gesture captioning framework, leveraging a motion-language model to generate descriptive captions at multiple granularities. Building upon this, we propose a conditional latent diffusion model with unified cross-dataset motion representation and a hierarchically controlled denoiser to achieve highly controlled, coordinated gesture generation. CoordSpeaker pioneers the first exploration of gesture understanding and captioning to tackle the semantic gap in gesture generation while offering a novel perspective of bidirectional gesture-text mapping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method produces high-quality gestures that are both rhythmically synchronized with speeches and semantically coherent with arbitrary captions, achieving superior performance with higher efficiency compared to existing approaches.",

However, in multimodal scenarios, varying degrees of distribution shift across different modalities give rise to a complex coupling effect of unimodal shallow feature shift and cross-modal high-level semantic misalignment, posing a major obstacle to extending existing TTA methods to the multimodal field. To address this challenge, we propose a novel multimodal test-time adaptation (MMTTA) framework, termed as Bridging Modalities via Progressive Re-alignment (BriMPR). BriMPR, consisting of two progressively enhanced modules, tackles the coupling effect with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Specifically, we first decompose MMTTA into multiple unimodal feature alignment sub-problems. By leveraging the strong function approximation ability of prompt tuning, we calibrate the unimodal global feature distributions to their respective source distributions, so as to achieve the initial semantic re-alignment across modalities. Subsequently, we assign the credible pseudo-labels to combinations of masked and complete modalities, and introduce inter-modal instance-wise contrastive learning to further enhance the information interaction among modalities and refine the alignment. Extensive experiments on MMTTA tasks, including both corruption-based and real-world domain shift benchmarks, demonstrate the superiority of our method.

This poses a practical challenge to delivering VQA-enabled intelligence on QIoT endpoints, which often have few qubits, constrained shot budgets, and strict latency requirements. In this paper, we present a novel approach for escaping barren plateaus by including negative learning rates into the optimization process in QIoT devices. Our method introduces controlled instability into model training by switching between positive and negative learning phases, allowing recovery of significant gradients and exploring flatter areas in the loss landscape. We theoretically evaluate the effect of negative learning on gradient variance and propose conditions under which it helps escape from barren zones. The experimental findings on typical VQA benchmarks show consistent improvements in both convergence and simulation results over traditional optimizers.

We introduce MARVO, a physics-aware, learning-integrated odometry framework that fuses underwater image formation modeling, differentiable matching, and reinforcement-learning optimization. At the front-end, we extend transformer-based feature matcher with a Physics Aware Radiance Adapter that compensates for color channel attenuation and contrast loss, yielding geometrically consistent feature correspondences under turbidity. These semi dense matches are combined with inertial and pressure measurements inside a factor-graph backend, where we formulate a keyframe-based visual-inertial-barometric estimator using GTSAM library. Each keyframe introduces (i) Pre-integrated IMU motion factors, (ii) MARVO-derived visual pose factors, and (iii) barometric depth priors, giving a full-state MAP estimate in real time. Lastly, we introduce a Reinforcement-Learningbased Pose-Graph Optimizer that refines global trajectories beyond local minima of classical least-squares solvers by learning optimal retraction actions on SE(2).",

While natural illumination-based methods struggle to resolve this ambiguity, co-located light-camera setups offer better disentanglement as lighting can be easily calibrated via Structure-from-Motion. However, such setups introduce additional complexities like strong inter-reflections, dynamic shadows, near-field lighting, and moving specular highlights, which existing approaches fail to handle. We present GLOW, a Global Illumination-aware Inverse Rendering framework designed to address these challenges. GLOW integrates a neural implicit surface representation with a neural radiance cache to approximate global illumination, jointly optimizing geometry and reflectance through carefully designed regularization and initialization. We then introduce a dynamic radiance cache that adapts to sharp lighting discontinuities from near-field motion, and a surface-angle-weighted radiometric loss to suppress specular artifacts common in flashlight captures. Experiments show that GLOW substantially outperforms prior methods in material reflectance estimation under both natural and co-located illumination.",

            "summary": "When people reason about cause and effect, they often consider many competing \"what if\" scenarios before deciding which explanation fits best. Analogously, advanced language models capable of causal inference can consider multiple interventions and counterfactuals to judge the validity of causal claims. Crucially, this type of reasoning is less like a single calculation and more like an internal dialogue between alternative hypotheses. In this paper, we make this dialogue explicit through a dual-agent debate framework where one model provides a structured causal inference, and the other critically examines this reasoning for logical flaws. When disagreements arise, agents attempt to persuade each other, challenging each other's logic and revising their conclusions until they converge on a mutually agreed answer. To take advantage of this deliberative process, we specifically use reasoning language models, whose strengths in both causal inference and adversarial debate remain under-explored relative to standard large language models. We evaluate our approach on the CLadder dataset, a benchmark linking natural language questions to formally defined causal graphs across all three rungs of Pearl's ladder of causation. With Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1 as debater agents, we demonstrate that multi-agent debate improves DeepSeek-R1's overall accuracy in causal inference from 78.03% to 87.45%, with the counterfactual category specifically improving from 67.94% to 80.04% accuracy. Similarly, Qwen3's overall accuracy improves from 84.16% to 89.41%, and counterfactual questions from 71.53% to 80.35%, showing that strong models can still benefit greatly from debate with weaker agents. Our results highlight the potential of reasoning models as building blocks for multi-agent systems in causal inference, and demonstrate the importance of diverse perspectives in causal problem-solving.",

Beyond popular deterministic methods, generative models are gaining attention due to advancements in areas like image synthesis and video generation, as well as their inherent ability to provide probabilistic predictions. However, existing generative approaches mostly involve recurrent generative operations or repeated denoising steps, making the prediction laborious, particularly for long-term forecasting. Most of them only conduct experiments for relatively short-term forecasting, with limited comparison to deterministic methods in long-term forecasting, leaving their practical advantages unclear. This paper presents TARFVAE, a novel generative framework that combines the Transformer-based autoregressive flow (TARFLOW) and variational autoencoder (VAE) for efficient one-step generative time series forecasting. Inspired by the rethinking that complex architectures for extracting time series representations might not be necessary, we add a flow module, TARFLOW, to VAE to promote spontaneous learning of latent variables that benefit predictions. TARFLOW enhances VAE's posterior estimation by breaking the Gaussian assumption, thereby enabling a more informative latent space. TARFVAE uses only the forward process of TARFLOW, avoiding autoregressive inverse operations and thus ensuring fast generation. During generation, it samples from the prior latent space and directly generates full-horizon forecasts via the VAE decoder. With simple MLP modules, TARFVAE achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models across different forecast horizons on benchmark datasets while maintaining efficient prediction speed, demonstrating its effectiveness as an efficient and powerful solution for generative time series forecasting.",

Vision Language Models (VLMs) have gradually become a primary approach in this domain, demonstrating effective performance on single page tasks. However, their effectiveness diminishes when handling long documents. In such scenarios, clues are often scattered across multiple pages and modalities, and redundancy from lengthy inputs can impair the models judgment. While retrieval augmented generation mitigates this issue by filtering for question relevant content, the retrieved results still contain substantial redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose SLEUTH, a multi agent framework. Concretely, SLEUTH orchestrates a retriever and four collaborative agents in a coarse to fine process. The framework identifies key textual and visual clues within the retrieved pages, filters for salient visual evidence such as tables and charts, and analyzes the query to devise a reasoning strategy. It ultimately synthesizes a distilled, evidence dense multimodal context to generate the final prediction. SLEUTH is model agnostic and scalable. When paired with advanced VLM backbones, it consistently improves performance on multiple long document benchmarks, achieving state of the art results. Ablation studies verify each modules effectiveness and confirm the benefits of our hierarchical refinement paradigm.",

A comprehensive understanding of selective SSMs in runtime behavior, resource utilization patterns, and scaling characteristics still remains unexplored, thus obstructing their optimal deployment and further architectural improvements. This paper presents a thorough empirical study of Mamba-1 and Mamba-2, systematically profiled for performance to assess the design principles that contribute to their efficiency in state-space modeling. A detailed analysis of computation patterns, memory access, I/O characteristics, and scaling properties was performed for sequence lengths ranging from 64 to 16384 tokens. Our findings show that the SSM component, a central part of the selective SSM architecture, demands a significant portion of computational resources compared to other components in the Mamba block. Based on these insights, we propose a pruning technique that selectively removes low-activity states within the SSM component, achieving measurable throughput and memory gains while maintaining accuracy within a moderate pruning regime. This approach results in performance improvements across varying sequence lengths, achieving a 1.14x speedup and reducing memory usage by 11.50\\%. These results offer valuable guidance for designing more efficient SSM architectures that can be applied to a wide range of real-world applications.",

            "summary": "This paper presents a novel trajectory planning pipeline for complex driving scenarios like autonomous lane changing, by integrating risk-aware planning with guaranteed collision avoidance into a unified optimization framework. We first construct a dynamic risk fields (DRF) that captures both the static and dynamic collision risks from surrounding vehicles. Then, we develop a rigorous strategy for generating time-varying convex feasible spaces that ensure kinematic feasibility and safety requirements. The trajectory planning problem is formulated as a finite-horizon optimal control problem and solved using a constrained iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) algorithm that jointly optimizes trajectory smoothness, control effort, and risk exposure while maintaining strict feasibility. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional approaches in terms of safety and efficiency, achieving collision-free trajectories with shorter lane-changing distances (28.59 m) and times (2.84 s) while maintaining smooth and comfortable acceleration patterns. In dense roundabout environments the planner further demonstrates robust adaptability, producing larger safety margins, lower jerk, and superior curvature smoothness compared with APF, MPC, and RRT based baselines. These results confirm that the integrated DRF with convex feasible space and constrained iLQR solver provides a balanced solution for safe, efficient, and comfortable trajectory generation in dynamic and interactive traffic scenarios.",

            "summary": "To understand how neural systems process information, it is often essential to compare one circuit with another, one brain with another, or data with a model. Traditional similarity measures ignore the dynamical processes underlying neural representations. Dynamical similarity methods offer a framework to compare the temporal structure of dynamical systems by embedding their (possibly) nonlinear dynamics into a globally linear space and there computing conjugacy metrics. However, identifying the best embedding and computing these metrics can be computationally slow. Here we introduce fast Dynamical Similarity Analysis (fastDSA), which is computationally far more efficient than previous methods while maintaining their accuracy and robustness. FastDSA introduces two key components that boost efficiency: (1) automatic selection of the effective model order of the Hankel (delay) embedding from the data via a data-driven singular-value threshold that identifies the informative subspace and discards noise to lower computational cost without sacrificing signal, and (2) a novel optimization procedure and objective, which replaces the slow exact orthogonality constraint in finding a minimal distance between dynamics matrices with a lightweight process to keep the search close to the space of orthogonal transformations. We demonstrate that fastDSA is at least an order of magnitude faster than the previous methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fastDSA has the properties of its ancestor, including its invariances and sensitivities to system dynamics. FastDSA, therefore, provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for dynamical similarity analysis.",

To rigorously study this, we introduce MMA-Bench comprising videos and tasks that probe a model's reliance on specific modalities. Using black-box and white-box interpretability techniques, we provide a critical analysis of the brittleness of both open- and closed-sourced MLLMs. We show that current MLLMs struggle under misaligned audio-visual pairs and simple misleading text, thereby lacking robust multi-modal reasoning. Building on these findings, we propose a modality alignment tuning strategy to teach the model when to prioritize, leverage, or ignore specific modality cues. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we show that our alignment tuning yields demonstrably stronger multimodal grounding. This work provides both interpretability tools and a clear path toward developing MLLMs with intrinsically reliable cross-modal reasoning. Code and dataset will be publicly available.",
