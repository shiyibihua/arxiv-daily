## 💡 一句话要点

**基准测试多模态大语言模型在标准人脸识别数据集上的性能**

**关键词**: `多模态大语言模型` `人脸识别` `基准测试` `零样本学习` `开源模型`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：多模态大语言模型在人脸识别中的潜力未被充分探索，需与专业模型比较。
2. 方法要点：系统评估开源MLLMs在LFW等数据集上的零样本识别能力。
3. 实验或效果：MLLMs捕获语义线索，但在高精度场景下落后于专业模型。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
> across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face
> recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of
> open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face
> recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work,
> we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face
> recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW,
> CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich
> semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models
> in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This
> benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition,
> offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy
> and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in
> the project page.
