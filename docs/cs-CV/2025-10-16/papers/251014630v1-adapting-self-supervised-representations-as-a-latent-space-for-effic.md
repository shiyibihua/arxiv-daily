## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We introduce Representation Tokenizer (RepTok), a generative modeling
> framework that represents an image using a single continuous latent token
> obtained from self-supervised vision transformers. Building on a pre-trained
> SSL encoder, we fine-tune only the semantic token embedding and pair it with a
> generative decoder trained jointly using a standard flow matching objective.
> This adaptation enriches the token with low-level, reconstruction-relevant
> details, enabling faithful image reconstruction. To preserve the favorable
> geometry of the original SSL space, we add a cosine-similarity loss that
> regularizes the adapted token, ensuring the latent space remains smooth and
> suitable for generation. Our single-token formulation resolves spatial
> redundancies of 2D latent spaces and significantly reduces training costs.
> Despite its simplicity and efficiency, RepTok achieves competitive results on
> class-conditional ImageNet generation and naturally extends to text-to-image
> synthesis, reaching competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under
> extremely limited training budgets. Our findings highlight the potential of
> fine-tuned SSL representations as compact and effective latent spaces for
> efficient generative modeling.
