## 💡 一句话要点

**提出DentVFM视觉基础模型以解决牙科AI泛化不足问题**

**关键词**: `视觉基础模型` `自监督学习` `牙科放射学` `多模态图像` `泛化能力` `基准测试`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 牙科放射图像解读受限于专业医生短缺和现有AI系统泛化能力差
2. 基于自监督学习构建多模态牙科图像数据集，开发任务无关视觉表示模型
3. 在综合基准测试中显著优于基线，实现跨任务和跨模态可靠诊断

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Oral and maxillofacial radiology plays a vital role in dental healthcare, but
> radiographic image interpretation is limited by a shortage of trained
> professionals. While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI
> systems are restricted by their single-modality focus, task-specific design,
> and reliance on costly labeled data, hindering their generalization across
> diverse clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DentVFM,
> the first family of vision foundation models (VFMs) designed for dentistry.
> DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of
> dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large
> curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal
> radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D
> variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in
> dental intelligence assessment and benchmarks, we introduce DentBench, a
> comprehensive benchmark covering eight dental subspecialties, more diseases,
> imaging modalities, and a wide geographical distribution. DentVFM shows
> impressive generalist intelligence, demonstrating robust generalization to
> diverse dental tasks, such as disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker
> identification, and anatomical landmark detection and segmentation.
> Experimental results indicate DentVFM significantly outperforms supervised,
> self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines, offering superior
> generalization, label efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, DentVFM
> enables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than
> experienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable.
> DentVFM sets a new paradigm for dental AI, offering a scalable, adaptable, and
> label-efficient model to improve intelligent dental healthcare and address
> critical gaps in global oral healthcare.
