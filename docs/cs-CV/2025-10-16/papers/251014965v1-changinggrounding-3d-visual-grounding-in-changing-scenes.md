## 💡 一句话要点

**提出ChangingGrounding基准与Mem-ChangingGrounder方法，以解决动态场景中的3D视觉定位问题。**

**关键词**: `3D视觉定位` `动态场景` `跨模态检索` `多视图融合` `零样本学习` `基准数据集`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有3D视觉定位方法依赖更新点云，在动态场景中成本高且不实用。
2. 方法要点：结合跨模态检索与轻量多视图融合，实现零样本目标定位与高效探索。
3. 实验或效果：在ChangingGrounding基准上，Mem-ChangingGrounder定位精度最高且探索成本显著降低。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Real-world robots localize objects from natural-language instructions while
> scenes around them keep changing. Yet most of the existing 3D visual grounding
> (3DVG) method still assumes a reconstructed and up-to-date point cloud, an
> assumption that forces costly re-scans and hinders deployment. We argue that
> 3DVG should be formulated as an active, memory-driven problem, and we introduce
> ChangingGrounding, the first benchmark that explicitly measures how well an
> agent can exploit past observations, explore only where needed, and still
> deliver precise 3D boxes in changing scenes. To set a strong reference point,
> we also propose Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method for this task that
> marries cross-modal retrieval with lightweight multi-view fusion: it identifies
> the object type implied by the query, retrieves relevant memories to guide
> actions, then explores the target efficiently in the scene, falls back when
> previous operations are invalid, performs multi-view scanning of the target,
> and projects the fused evidence from multi-view scans to get accurate object
> bounding boxes. We evaluate different baselines on ChangingGrounding, and our
> Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy while greatly
> reducing exploration cost. We hope this benchmark and method catalyze a shift
> toward practical, memory-centric 3DVG research for real-world applications.
