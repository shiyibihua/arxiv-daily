## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Video-based object detection plays a vital role in safety-critical
> applications. While deep learning-based object detectors have achieved
> impressive performance, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
> particularly those involving universal perturbations. In this work, we propose
> a minimally distorted universal adversarial attack tailored for video object
> detection, which leverages nuclear norm regularization to promote structured
> perturbations concentrated in the background. To optimize this formulation
> efficiently, we employ an adaptive, optimistic exponentiated gradient method
> that enhances both scalability and convergence. Our results demonstrate that
> the proposed attack outperforms both low-rank projected gradient descent and
> Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness.
