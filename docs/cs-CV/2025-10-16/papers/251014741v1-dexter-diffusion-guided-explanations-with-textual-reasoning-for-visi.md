## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Understanding and explaining the behavior of machine learning models is
> essential for building transparent and trustworthy AI systems. We introduce
> DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language
> models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER
> operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that
> strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to
> elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision
> patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language
> explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training
> data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three
> tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias
> explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of
> visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user
> study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments
> on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms
> existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting.
