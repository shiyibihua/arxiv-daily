## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Exploring and understanding efficient image representations is a
> long-standing challenge in computer vision. While deep learning has achieved
> remarkable progress across image understanding tasks, its internal
> representations are often opaque, making it difficult to interpret how visual
> information is processed. In contrast, classical visual descriptors (e.g. edge,
> colour, and intensity distribution) have long been fundamental to image
> analysis and remain intuitively understandable to humans. Motivated by this
> gap, we ask a central question: Can modern learning benefit from these
> classical cues? In this paper, we answer it with VisualSplit, a framework that
> explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating
> each as an independent but complementary component of visual knowledge. Through
> a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, VisualSplit learns to capture the
> essence of each visual descriptor while preserving their interpretability. By
> explicitly decomposing visual attributes, our method inherently facilitates
> effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks, including image
> generation and editing, extending beyond conventional classification and
> segmentation, suggesting the effectiveness of this new learning approach for
> visual understanding. Project page: https://chenyuanqu.com/VisualSplit/.
