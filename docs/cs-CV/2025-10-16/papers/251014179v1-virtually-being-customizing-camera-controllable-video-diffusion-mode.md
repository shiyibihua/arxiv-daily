## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We introduce a framework that enables both multi-view character consistency
> and 3D camera control in video diffusion models through a novel customization
> data pipeline. We train the character consistency component with recorded
> volumetric capture performances re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories
> via 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), lighting variability obtained with a video
> relighting model. We fine-tune state-of-the-art open-source video diffusion
> models on this data to provide strong multi-view identity preservation, precise
> camera control, and lighting adaptability. Our framework also supports core
> capabilities for virtual production, including multi-subject generation using
> two approaches: joint training and noise blending, the latter enabling
> efficient composition of independently customized models at inference time; it
> also achieves scene and real-life video customization as well as control over
> motion and spatial layout during customization. Extensive experiments show
> improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera
> control and lighting adaptability, advancing the integration of video
> generation into virtual production. Our project page is available at:
