## 💡 一句话要点

**提出Alpha-Service框架，通过AI眼镜实现主动实时服务辅助**

**关键词**: `主动服务` `AI眼镜` `多智能体系统` `第一人称视频` `个性化辅助` `实时干预`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有AI服务多为被动响应，需转向主动预测用户需求
2. 方法要点：基于冯·诺依曼架构，构建多组件系统感知环境与个性化服务
3. 实验或效果：案例展示如Blackjack顾问，能无提示感知意图并提供帮助

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and
> adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
> that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
> services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
> argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
> anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
> realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
> addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
> service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
> both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
> computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
> key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
> task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
> for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
> interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
> multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time
> Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,
> demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user
> intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.
