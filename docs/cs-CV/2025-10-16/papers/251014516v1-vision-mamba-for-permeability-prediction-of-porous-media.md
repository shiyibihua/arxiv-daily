## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Vision Mamba has recently received attention as an alternative to Vision
> Transformers (ViTs) for image classification. The network size of Vision Mamba
> scales linearly with input image resolution, whereas ViTs scale quadratically,
> a feature that improves computational and memory efficiency. Moreover, Vision
> Mamba requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than
> traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and thus, they can be more
> memory efficient. Because of these features, we introduce, for the first time,
> a neural network that uses Vision Mamba as its backbone for predicting the
> permeability of three-dimensional porous media. We compare the performance of
> Vision Mamba with ViT and CNN models across multiple aspects of permeability
> prediction and perform an ablation study to assess the effects of its
> components on accuracy. We demonstrate in practice the aforementioned
> advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in the permeability prediction of
> three-dimensional porous media. We make the source code publicly available to
> facilitate reproducibility and to enable other researchers to build on and
> extend this work. We believe the proposed framework has the potential to be
> integrated into large vision models in which Vision Mamba is used instead of
> ViTs.
