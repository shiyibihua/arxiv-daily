## 💡 一句话要点

**提出R-Super方法，利用医学报告训练AI进行多肿瘤分割，减少对人工标注的依赖。**

**关键词**: `肿瘤分割` `医学报告利用` `AI训练扩展` `多肿瘤检测` `CT扫描分析`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：AI肿瘤分割需大量人工标注，成本高昂且难以扩展。
2. 方法要点：使用医学报告描述训练AI模型，匹配肿瘤特征进行分割。
3. 实验或效果：在101,654份报告上训练，性能媲美723个掩码，组合使用提升敏感性和特异性。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed
> tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for
> effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on
> these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence
> (AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such
> models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines
> of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly,
> requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT
> scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing
> the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology
> results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI
> training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match
> their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with
> large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing
> the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI
> models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining
> reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%,
> surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably,
> R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate,
> bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models
> previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that
> large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing
> a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor
> types.
