## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Defective surgical instruments pose serious risks to sterility, mechanical
> integrity, and patient safety, increasing the likelihood of surgical
> complications. However, quality control in surgical instrument manufacturing
> often relies on manual inspection, which is prone to human error and
> inconsistency. This study introduces SurgScan, an AI-powered defect detection
> framework for surgical instruments. Using YOLOv8, SurgScan classifies defects
> in real-time, ensuring high accuracy and industrial scalability. The model is
> trained on a high-resolution dataset of 102,876 images, covering 11 instrument
> types and five major defect categories. Extensive evaluation against
> state-of-the-art CNN architectures confirms that SurgScan achieves the highest
> accuracy (99.3%) with real-time inference speeds of 4.2-5.8 ms per image,
> making it suitable for industrial deployment. Statistical analysis demonstrates
> that contrast-enhanced preprocessing significantly improves defect detection,
> addressing key limitations in visual inspection. SurgScan provides a scalable,
> cost-effective AI solution for automated quality control, reducing reliance on
> manual inspection while ensuring compliance with ISO 13485 and FDA standards,
> paving the way for enhanced defect detection in medical manufacturing.
