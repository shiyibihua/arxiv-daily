## 💡 一句话要点

**提出基于上下文学习的无配对视频剪辑预训练策略，以解决指令视频编辑的数据稀缺问题。**

**关键词**: `指令视频编辑` `上下文学习` `无配对数据预训练` `视频生成模型` `编辑指令对齐`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：指令视频编辑因大规模配对数据成本高而发展受限。
2. 方法要点：利用无配对视频剪辑预训练，赋予模型通用编辑能力，再少量精调。
3. 实验效果：在指令对齐和视觉保真度上优于现有方法，提升12%指令遵循和15%编辑质量。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension
> to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and
> complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To
> address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for
> instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from
> unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation
> model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as
> adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing
> instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small
> amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our
> framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic
> editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated
> editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality.
> Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing
> instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and
> visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following
> and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.
