## 💡 一句话要点

**提出联合建模Big Five和HEXACO的方法，用于多模态人类行为中的外显人格特质识别。**

**关键词**: `多模态人格识别` `Big Five模型` `HEXACO模型` `联合建模` `视频行为分析`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有研究未关注HEXACO外显特质及其与Big Five的关系。
2. 方法要点：通过联合优化同时识别Big Five和HEXACO人格特质。
3. 实验或效果：在自我介绍视频数据集上验证方法有效识别两种人格特质。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long
> been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology,
> for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human
> behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent
> personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO
> which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression
> and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the
> relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning
> have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to
> improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed
> method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments
> using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
> can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.
