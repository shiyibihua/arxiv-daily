## 💡 一句话要点

**提出3DScenePrompt框架，通过3D场景记忆实现场景一致和相机可控的视频生成。**

**关键词**: `视频生成` `3D场景建模` `相机控制` `场景一致性` `动态SLAM` `空间提示`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：长视频生成中场景一致性和相机控制难以兼顾，动态元素易干扰静态几何。
2. 方法要点：使用动态SLAM和动态掩码分离静态几何，构建3D场景记忆作为空间提示。
3. 实验或效果：在场景一致性、相机可控性和生成质量上显著优于现有方法。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk
> from arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and
> preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a
> short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates
> context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on
> both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent
> content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal
> boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve
> dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene
> memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the
> entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our
> newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static
> scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then
> be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped
> views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to
> evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain
> long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing
> computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate
> that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene
> consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality. Project page :
