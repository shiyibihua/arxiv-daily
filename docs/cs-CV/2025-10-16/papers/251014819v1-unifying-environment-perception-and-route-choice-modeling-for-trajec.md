## 💡 一句话要点

**提出PRTraj框架，统一环境感知与路径选择建模以改进轨迹表示学习**

**关键词**: `轨迹表示学习` `环境感知` `路径选择建模` `多粒度语义` `下游任务评估` `数据效率`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 现有轨迹表示学习方法忽略外部环境和内部路径选择行为，导致表示不完整
2. PRTraj通过环境感知模块和路径选择编码器，捕获多粒度语义和决策序列
3. 在3个真实数据集和5个下游任务中验证有效性，并展示强数据效率

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into
> low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream
> tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory
> similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight:
> treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without
> considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that
> govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that
> unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit
> \textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation
> learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an
> Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing
> multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions.
> Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then
> captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its
> constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These
> route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global
> trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5
> downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj.
> Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust
> performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at:
