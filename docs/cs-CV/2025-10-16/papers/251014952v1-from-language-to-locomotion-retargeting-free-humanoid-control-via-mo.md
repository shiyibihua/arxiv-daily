## 💡 一句话要点

**提出RoboGhost框架，通过运动潜在引导实现免重定向的人形机器人控制**

**关键词**: `人形机器人控制` `语言到动作` `扩散模型` `运动潜在表示` `免重定向框架`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 现有语言引导人形机器人运动流程繁琐，易产生累积误差和延迟
2. 使用扩散策略直接从噪声去噪生成可执行动作，避免中间阶段
3. 实验显示降低延迟、提高成功率，并支持多模态扩展

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Natural language offers a natural interface for humanoid robots, but existing
> language-guided humanoid locomotion pipelines remain cumbersome and unreliable.
> They typically decode human motion, retarget it to robot morphology, and then
> track it with a physics-based controller. However, this multi-stage process is
> prone to cumulative errors, introduces high latency, and yields weak coupling
> between semantics and control. These limitations call for a more direct pathway
> from language to action, one that eliminates fragile intermediate stages.
> Therefore, we present RoboGhost, a retargeting-free framework that directly
> conditions humanoid policies on language-grounded motion latents. By bypassing
> explicit motion decoding and retargeting, RoboGhost enables a diffusion-based
> policy to denoise executable actions directly from noise, preserving semantic
> intent and supporting fast, reactive control. A hybrid causal
> transformer-diffusion motion generator further ensures long-horizon consistency
> while maintaining stability and diversity, yielding rich latent representations
> for precise humanoid behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboGhost
> substantially reduces deployment latency, improves success rates and tracking
> accuracy, and produces smooth, semantically aligned locomotion on real
> humanoids. Beyond text, the framework naturally extends to other modalities
> such as images, audio, and music, providing a general foundation for
> vision-language-action humanoid systems.
