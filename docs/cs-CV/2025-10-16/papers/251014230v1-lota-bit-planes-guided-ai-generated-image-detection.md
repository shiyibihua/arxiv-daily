## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The rapid advancement of GAN and Diffusion models makes it more difficult to
> distinguish AI-generated images from real ones. Recent studies often use
> image-based reconstruction errors as an important feature for determining
> whether an image is AI-generated. However, these approaches typically incur
> high computational costs and also fail to capture intrinsic noisy features
> present in the raw images. To solve these problems, we innovatively refine
> error extraction by using bit-plane-based image processing, as lower bit planes
> indeed represent noise patterns in images. We introduce an effective bit-planes
> guided noisy image generation and exploit various image normalization
> strategies, including scaling and thresholding. Then, to amplify the noise
> signal for easier AI-generated image detection, we design a maximum gradient
> patch selection that applies multi-directional gradients to compute the noise
> score and selects the region with the highest score. Finally, we propose a
> lightweight and effective classification head and explore two different
> structures: noise-based classifier and noise-guided classifier. Extensive
> experiments on the GenImage benchmark demonstrate the outstanding performance
> of our method, which achieves an average accuracy of \textbf{98.9\%}
> (\textbf{11.9}\%~$\uparrow$) and shows excellent cross-generator generalization
> capability. Particularly, our method achieves an accuracy of over 98.2\% from
> GAN to Diffusion and over 99.2\% from Diffusion to GAN. Moreover, it performs
> error extraction at the millisecond level, nearly a hundred times faster than
> existing methods. The code is at https://github.com/hongsong-wang/LOTA.
