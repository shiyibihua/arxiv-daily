## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Imitation learning (IL) aims to learn a policy from expert demonstrations and
> has been applied to various applications. By learning from the expert policy,
> IL methods do not require environmental interactions or reward signals.
> However, most existing imitation learning algorithms assume perfect expert
> demonstrations, but expert demonstrations often contain imperfections caused by
> errors from human experts or sensor/control system inaccuracies. To address the
> above problems, this work proposes a filter-and-restore framework to best
> leverage expert demonstrations with inherent noise. Our proposed method first
> filters clean samples from the demonstrations and then learns conditional
> diffusion models to recover the noisy ones. We evaluate our proposed framework
> and existing methods in various domains, including robot arm manipulation,
> dexterous manipulation, and locomotion. The experiment results show that our
> proposed framework consistently outperforms existing methods across all the
> tasks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component
> and demonstrate the framework's robustness to different noise types and levels.
> These results confirm the practical applicability of our framework to noisy
> offline demonstration data.
