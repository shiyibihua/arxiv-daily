## 💡 一句话要点

**提出多任务深度学习框架，用于皮肤病变分类、ABCDE特征量化与演化模拟。**

**关键词**: `皮肤病变分类` `多任务学习` `ABCDE特征量化` `演化模拟` `医学图像分析`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：自动皮肤病变分析挑战大，ABCDE特征缺乏可解释性。
2. 方法要点：框架同时分类病变并量化ABCD特征，模拟E演化。
3. 实验或效果：在HAM10000数据集上，分类准确率约89%，AUC达0.96。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Early detection of melanoma has grown to be essential because it
> significantly improves survival rates, but automated analysis of skin lesions
> still remains challenging. ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border
> irregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known
> classification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat
> it as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not
> explained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both
> classifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each
> ABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order
> to represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A,
> B, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this
> framework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin
> lesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are
> conducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images
> of skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with
> an accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the
> feature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and
> diameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model. Overall,
> this work provides a deep learning framework that will allow doctors to link ML
> diagnoses to clinically relevant criteria, thus improving our understanding of
> skin cancer progression.
