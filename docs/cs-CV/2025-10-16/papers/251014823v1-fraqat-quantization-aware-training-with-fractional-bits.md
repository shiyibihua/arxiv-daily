## 💡 一句话要点

**提出分数位量化方法以在移动设备上保持生成模型质量**

**关键词**: `量化感知训练` `分数位量化` `生成模型` `移动部署` `扩散模型` `模型压缩`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 大模型在移动设备部署受限于内存和计算资源，量化后质量下降。
2. 方法逐步从32位降至4位量化，利用分数位优化维持生成质量。
3. 在多种扩散模型上验证，FiD降低4-7%，并在三星S25U上成功部署。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> State-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models have demonstrated impressive
> capabilities in image synthesis or text generation, often with a large capacity
> model. However, these large models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to the
> limited availability of on-board memory and computations. Quantization methods
> lower the precision of the model parameters, allowing for efficient
> computations, \eg, in \INT{8}. Although aggressive quantization addresses
> efficiency and memory constraints, preserving the quality of the model remains
> a challenge. To retain quality in previous aggressive quantization, we propose
> a new fractional bits quantization (\short) approach. The novelty is a simple
> yet effective idea: we progressively reduce the model's precision from 32 to 4
> bits per parameter, and exploit the fractional bits during optimization to
> maintain high generation quality. We show that the \short{} yields improved
> quality on a variety of diffusion models, including SD3.5-Medium, Sana,
> \pixart, and FLUX.1-schnell, while achieving $4-7\%$ lower FiD than standard
> QAT. Finally, we deploy and run Sana on a Samsung S25U, which runs on the
> Qualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite Hexagon Tensor Processor (HTP).
