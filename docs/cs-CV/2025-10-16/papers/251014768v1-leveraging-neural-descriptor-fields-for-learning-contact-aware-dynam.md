## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Real-world dexterous manipulation often encounters unexpected errors and
> disturbances, which can lead to catastrophic failures, such as dropping the
> manipulated object. To address this challenge, we focus on the problem of
> catching a falling object while it remains within grasping range and,
> importantly, resetting the system to a configuration favorable for resuming the
> primary manipulation task. We propose Contact-Aware Dynamic Recovery (CADRE), a
> reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a Neural Descriptor Field
> (NDF)-inspired module to extract implicit contact features. Compared to methods
> that rely solely on object pose or point cloud input, NDFs can directly reason
> about finger-object correspondence and adapt to different object geometries.
> Our experiments show that incorporating contact features improves training
> efficiency, enhances convergence performance for RL training, and ultimately
> leads to more successful recoveries. Additionally, we demonstrate that CADRE
> can generalize zero-shot to unseen objects with different geometries.
