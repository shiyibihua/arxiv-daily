## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language
> models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge
> retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant
> advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles
> with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results.
> To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed
> Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing
> stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal
> information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text
> features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage
> performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this
> end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and
> format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This
> enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and
> filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and
> InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality,
> achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at
