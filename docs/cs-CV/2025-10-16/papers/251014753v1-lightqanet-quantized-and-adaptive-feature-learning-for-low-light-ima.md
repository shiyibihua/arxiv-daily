## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve illumination while
> preserving high-quality color and texture. However, existing methods often fail
> to extract reliable feature representations due to severely degraded
> pixel-level information under low-light conditions, resulting in poor texture
> restoration, color inconsistency, and artifact. To address these challenges, we
> propose LightQANet, a novel framework that introduces quantized and adaptive
> feature learning for low-light enhancement, aiming to achieve consistent and
> robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions. From the static
> modeling perspective, we design a Light Quantization Module (LQM) to explicitly
> extract and quantify illumination-related factors from image features. By
> enforcing structured light factor learning, LQM enhances the extraction of
> light-invariant representations and mitigates feature inconsistency across
> varying illumination levels. From the dynamic adaptation perspective, we
> introduce a Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM), which encodes illumination priors
> into learnable prompts to dynamically guide the feature learning process. LAPM
> enables the model to flexibly adapt to complex and continuously changing
> lighting conditions, further improving image enhancement. Extensive experiments
> on multiple low-light datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
> state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior qualitative and quantitative
> results across various challenging lighting scenarios.
