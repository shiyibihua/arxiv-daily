## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Manipulating three-dimensional (3D) deformable objects presents significant
> challenges for robotic systems due to their infinite-dimensional state space
> and complex deformable dynamics. This paper proposes a novel model-free
> approach for shape control with constraints imposed on key points. Unlike
> existing methods that rely on feature dimensionality reduction, the proposed
> controller leverages the coordinates of key points as the feature vector, which
> are extracted from the deformable object's point cloud using deep learning
> methods. This approach not only reduces the dimensionality of the feature space
> but also retains the spatial information of the object. By extracting key
> points, the manipulation of deformable objects is simplified into a visual
> servoing problem, where the shape dynamics are described using a deformation
> Jacobian matrix. To enhance control accuracy, a prescribed performance control
> method is developed by integrating barrier Lyapunov functions (BLF) to enforce
> constraints on the key points. The stability of the closed-loop system is
> rigorously analyzed and verified using the Lyapunov method. Experimental
> results further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed
> method.
