## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Recovering 4D from monocular video, which jointly estimates dynamic geometry
> and camera poses, is an inevitably challenging problem. While recent
> pointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great
> progress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic
> scenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving
> objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the
> reconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages
> temporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to
> 4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of
> correspondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train
> a dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,
> facilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from
> the static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.
> Furthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to
> recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the
> correspondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling
> fully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework
> achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across
> multiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,
> and point tracking. Project Page: https://littlepure2333.github.io/C4D
