## 💡 一句话要点

**提出TOUCH框架以生成可控、多样且物理合理的手-物体自由交互**

**关键词**: `手-物体交互生成` `自由形式交互` `多级扩散模型` `细粒度语义控制` `物理约束优化` `WildO2数据集`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 现有手-物体交互生成局限于固定抓取模式，缺乏日常交互多样性。
2. TOUCH使用多级扩散模型，结合细粒度语义控制，生成超越抓取的手部姿势。
3. 实验验证方法能生成可控、多样且物理合理的手交互，代表日常活动。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Hand-object interaction (HOI) is fundamental for humans to express intent.
> Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping
> patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or
> generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language.
> Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable
> grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these
> limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate
> controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained
> intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing,
> poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild
> diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet
> videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents
> and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on
> this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a
> multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to
> generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages
> explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with
> contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive
> experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse,
> and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.
