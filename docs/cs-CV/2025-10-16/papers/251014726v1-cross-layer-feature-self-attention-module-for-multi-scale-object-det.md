## 💡 一句话要点

**提出跨层特征自注意力模块以提升多尺度目标检测性能**

**关键词**: `多尺度目标检测` `跨层注意力` `特征融合` `自注意力机制` `SSD框架`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 现有方法忽视多尺度特征间的层间依赖，限制检测大尺度变化物体的能力
2. 模块结合卷积局部特征提取、Transformer全局建模和特征融合，增强多尺度表示
3. 集成SSD300显著提升PASCAL VOC和COCO数据集mAP，加速收敛且计算开销小

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Recent object detection methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging
> attention mechanisms to improve feature discriminability. However, most
> existing approaches are confined to refining single-layer or fusing dual-layer
> features, overlooking the rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale
> representations. This limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
> information essential for detecting objects with large scale variations. In
> this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module
> (CFSAM), which holistically models both local and global dependencies within
> multi-scale feature maps. CFSAM consists of three key components: a
> convolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit
> that efficiently captures cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion
> mechanism to restore and enhance the original representations. When integrated
> into the SSD300 framework, CFSAM significantly boosts detection performance,
> achieving 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO
> (vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Moreover, the
> module accelerates convergence during training without introducing substantial
> computational overhead. Our work highlights the importance of explicit
> cross-layer attention modeling in advancing multi-scale object detection.
