## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This study presents a powered transtibial prosthesis with complete push-off
> assistance, RoboANKLE. The design aims to fulfill specific requirements, such
> as a sufficient range of motion (RoM) while providing the necessary torque for
> achieving natural ankle motion in daily activities. Addressing the challenges
> faced in designing active transtibial prostheses, such as maintaining energetic
> autonomy and minimizing weight, is vital for the study. With this aim, we try
> to imitate the human ankle by providing extensive push-off assistance to
> achieve a natural-like torque profile. Thus, Energy Store and Extended Release
> mechanism (ESER) is employed with a novel Extra Energy Storage (EES) mechanism.
> Kinematic and kinetic analyses are carried out to determine the design
> parameters and assess the design performance. Subsequently, a Computer-Aided
> Design (CAD) model is built and used in comprehensive dynamic and structural
> analyses. These analyses are used for the design performance evaluation and
> determine the forces and torques applied to the prosthesis, which aids in
> optimizing the design for minimal weight via structural analysis and topology
> optimization. The design of the prototype is then finalized and manufactured
> for experimental evaluation to validate the design and functionality. The
> prototype is realized with a mass of 1.92 kg and dimensions of 261x107x420 mm.
> The Functional evaluations of the RoboANKLE revealed that it is capable of
> achieving the natural maximum dorsi-flexion angle with 95% accuracy. Also,
> Thanks to the implemented mechanisms, the results show that RoboANKLE can
> generate 57% higher than the required torque for natural walking. The result of
> the power generation capacity of the RoboANKLE is 10% more than the natural
> power during the gait cycle.
