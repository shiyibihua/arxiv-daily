## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Optical camera communication (OCC) represents a promising visible light
> communication technology. Nonetheless, typical OCC systems utilizing
> frame-based cameras are encumbered by limitations, including low bit rate and
> high processing load. To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an
> event-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS
> enables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its
> asynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC
> systems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse
> position modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge,
> no modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique
> characteristics of the EVS. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme,
> called the event interval modulation (EIM) scheme, specifically designed for
> event-based OCC. EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating
> information using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a
> theoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the
> parameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency
> response specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM
> is determined experimentally. We conduct transmission experiments based on the
> obtained parameters. Finally, we report successful transmission at 28 kbps over
> 10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in an indoor environment. This sets a new
> benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.
