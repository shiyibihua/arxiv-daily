## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Effective monitoring of whale populations is critical for conservation, but
> traditional survey methods are expensive and difficult to scale. While prior
> work has shown that whales can be identified in very high-resolution (VHR)
> satellite imagery, large-scale automated detection remains challenging due to a
> lack of annotated imagery, variability in image quality and environmental
> conditions, and the cost of building robust machine learning pipelines over
> massive remote sensing archives. We present a semi-automated approach for
> surfacing possible whale detections in VHR imagery using a statistical anomaly
> detection method that flags spatial outliers, i.e. "interesting points". We
> pair this detector with a web-based labeling interface designed to enable
> experts to quickly annotate the interesting points. We evaluate our system on
> three benchmark scenes with known whale annotations and achieve recalls of
> 90.3% to 96.4%, while reducing the area requiring expert inspection by up to
> 99.8% -- from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km in some cases. Our method
> does not rely on labeled training data and offers a scalable first step toward
> future machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space. We have open
> sourced this pipeline at https://github.com/microsoft/whales.
