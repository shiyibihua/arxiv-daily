## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Multi-agent trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous systems operating in dense, interactive environments. Existing methods often fail to jointly capture agents' long-term goals and their fine-grained social interactions, which leads to unrealistic multi-agent futures. We propose VISTA, a recursive goal-conditioned transformer for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. VISTA combines (i) a cross-attention fusion module that integrates long-horizon intent with past motion, (ii) a social-token attention mechanism for flexible interaction modeling across agents, and (iii) pairwise attention maps that make social influence patterns interpretable at inference time. Our model turns single-agent goal-conditioned prediction into a coherent multi-agent forecasting framework. Beyond standard displacement metrics, we evaluate trajectory collision rates as a measure of joint realism. On the high-density MADRAS benchmark and on SDD, VISTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and substantially fewer collisions. On MADRAS, it reduces the average collision rate of strong baselines from 2.14 to 0.03 percent, and on SDD it attains zero collisions while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE. These results show that VISTA generates socially compliant, goal-aware, and interpretable trajectories, making it promising for safety-critical autonomous systems.
