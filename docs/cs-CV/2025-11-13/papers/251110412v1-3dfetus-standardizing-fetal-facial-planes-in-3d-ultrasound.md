## 💡 一句话要点

**提出GT++和3DFETUS以自动化标准化胎儿3D超声面部平面定位**

**关键词**: `胎儿超声` `3D图像分析` `深度学习` `解剖平面定位` `医学影像标准化`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 胎儿超声面部平面获取困难，因胎儿运动、方向变异和操作者依赖导致不一致
2. GT++算法基于解剖标志估计标准平面，3DFETUS模型用深度学习自动化定位
3. 实验显示平均平移误差4.13mm、旋转误差7.93度，临床评估证实准确性提升

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Acquiring standard facial planes during routine fetal ultrasound (US) examinations is often challenging due to fetal movement, variability in orientation, and operator-dependent expertise. These factors contribute to inconsistencies, increased examination time, and potential diagnostic bias.
>   To address these challenges in the context of facial assessment, we present: 1) GT++, a robust algorithm that estimates standard facial planes from 3D US volumes using annotated anatomical landmarks; and 2) 3DFETUS, a deep learning model that automates and standardizes their localization in 3D fetal US volumes.
>   We evaluated our methods both qualitatively, through expert clinical review, and quantitatively. The proposed approach achieved a mean translation error of 4.13 mm and a mean rotation error of 7.93 degrees per plane, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods on 3D US volumes. Clinical assessments further confirmed the effectiveness of both GT++ and 3DFETUS, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in plane estimation accuracy.
