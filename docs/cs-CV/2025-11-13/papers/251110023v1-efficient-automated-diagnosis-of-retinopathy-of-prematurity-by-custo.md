## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper encompasses an in-depth examination of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) diagnosis, employing advanced deep learning methodologies. Our focus centers on refining and evaluating CNN-based approaches for precise and efficient ROP detection. We navigate the complexities of dataset curation, preprocessing strategies, and model architecture, aligning with research objectives encompassing model effectiveness, computational cost analysis, and time complexity assessment. Results underscore the supremacy of tailored CNN models over pre-trained counterparts, evident in heightened accuracy and F1-scores. Implementation of a voting system further enhances performance. Additionally, our study reveals the potential of the proposed customized CNN model to alleviate computational burdens associated with deep neural networks. Furthermore, we showcase the feasibility of deploying these models within dedicated software and hardware configurations, highlighting their utility as valuable diagnostic aids in clinical settings. In summary, our discourse significantly contributes to ROP diagnosis, unveiling the efficacy of deep learning models in enhancing diagnostic precision and efficiency.
