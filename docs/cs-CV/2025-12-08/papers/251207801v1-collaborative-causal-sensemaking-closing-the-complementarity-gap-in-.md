## 💡 一句话要点

**提出协作因果感知框架以解决人机决策支持中的互补性差距问题**

**关键词**: `人机协作决策` `因果感知` `AI伙伴系统` `认知模型` `互补性评估`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：人机团队在复杂高风险决策中常表现不佳，互补性未实现，专家在验证与过度依赖间摇摆。
2. 方法要点：将AI设计为认知工作伙伴，共同构建和测试因果假设，学习联合决策结果以促进双方改进。
3. 实验或效果：未知，但提出围绕训练生态、模型表示和以信任与互补性为中心的评价等挑战方向。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> LLM-based agents are rapidly being plugged into expert decision-support, yet in messy, high-stakes settings they rarely make the team smarter: human-AI teams often underperform the best individual, experts oscillate between verification loops and over-reliance, and the promised complementarity does not materialise. We argue this is not just a matter of accuracy, but a fundamental gap in how we conceive AI assistance: expert decisions are made through collaborative cognitive processes where mental models, goals, and constraints are continually co-constructed, tested, and revised between human and AI. We propose Collaborative Causal Sensemaking (CCS) as a research agenda and organizing framework for decision-support agents: systems designed as partners in cognitive work, maintaining evolving models of how particular experts reason, helping articulate and revise goals, co-constructing and stress-testing causal hypotheses, and learning from the outcomes of joint decisions so that both human and agent improve over time. We sketch challenges around training ecologies that make collaborative thinking instrumentally valuable, representations and interaction protocols for co-authored models, and evaluation centred on trust and complementarity. These directions can reframe MAS research around agents that participate in collaborative sensemaking and act as AI teammates that think with their human partners.
