## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven highly effective for edge and mobile vision tasks due to their computational efficiency. While many recent works seek to enhance CNNs with global contextual understanding via self-attention-based Vision Transformers, these approaches often introduce significant computational overhead. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to retain strong global perception without relying on computationally expensive components. We present GlimmerNet, an ultra-lightweight convolutional network built on the principle of separating receptive field diversity from feature recombination. GlimmerNet introduces Grouped Dilated Depthwise Convolutions(GDBlocks), which partition channels into groups with distinct dilation rates, enabling multi-scale feature extraction at no additional parameter cost. To fuse these features efficiently, we design a novel Aggregator module that recombines cross-group representations using grouped pointwise convolution, significantly lowering parameter overhead. With just 31K parameters and 29% fewer FLOPs than the most recent baseline, GlimmerNet achieves a new state-of-the-art weighted F1-score of 0.966 on the UAV-focused AIDERv2 dataset. These results establish a new accuracy-efficiency trade-off frontier for real-time emergency monitoring on resource-constrained UAV platforms.
