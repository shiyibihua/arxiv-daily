**关键词**: `自由手超声重建` `光流估计` `Mamba网络` `不确定性量化` `人机交互` `三维医学成像`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：临床超声采集依赖操作者，快速探头运动和亮度波动导致重建误差，降低临床信任度。
2. 方法要点：集成对比排序模块、光流流与Dual-Mamba时序模块，结合贝叶斯不确定性和人机交互层提供实时提示。
3. 实验或效果：在临床数据集上相比UltrasOM减少漂移15.2%、距离误差12.1%，并输出逐帧不确定性和显著性图。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Clinical ultrasound acquisition is highly operator-dependent, where rapid probe motion and brightness fluctuations often lead to reconstruction errors that reduce trust and clinical utility. We present UltrasODM, a dual-stream framework that assists sonographers during acquisition through calibrated per-frame uncertainty, saliency-based diagnostics, and actionable prompts. UltrasODM integrates (i) a contrastive ranking module that groups frames by motion similarity, (ii) an optical-flow stream fused with Dual-Mamba temporal modules for robust 6-DoF pose estimation, and (iii) a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) layer combining Bayesian uncertainty, clinician-calibrated thresholds, and saliency maps highlighting regions of low confidence. When uncertainty exceeds the threshold, the system issues unobtrusive alerts suggesting corrective actions such as re-scanning highlighted regions or slowing the sweep. Evaluated on a clinical freehand ultrasound dataset, UltrasODM reduces drift by 15.2%, distance error by 12.1%, and Hausdorff distance by 10.1% relative to UltrasOM, while producing per-frame uncertainty and saliency outputs. By emphasizing transparency and clinician feedback, UltrasODM improves reconstruction reliability and supports safer, more trustworthy clinical workflows.
