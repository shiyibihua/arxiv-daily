**关键词**: `Shapley归因` `选择性推断` `全局特征选择` `黑盒解释` `显著性检验` `代理模型`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：黑盒预测器中全局特征选择与显著性推断缺乏统计保证，难以稳定解释。
2. 方法要点：基于SHAP引导筛选特征，通过选择性推断拟合线性代理模型，输出p值和置信区间。
3. 实验或效果：在表格回归任务中，使用少量特征保持预测能力，特征集在重采样和模型间较稳定。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We propose $φ$-test, a global feature-selection and significance procedure for black-box predictors that combines Shapley attributions with selective inference. Given a trained model and an evaluation dataset, $φ$-test performs SHAP-guided screening and fits a linear surrogate on the screened features via a selection rule with a tractable selective-inference form. For each retained feature, it outputs a Shapley-based global score, a surrogate coefficient, and post-selection $p$-values and confidence intervals in a global feature-importance table. Experiments on real tabular regression tasks with tree-based and neural backbones suggest that $φ$-test can retain much of the predictive ability of the original model while using only a few features and producing feature sets that remain fairly stable across resamples and backbone classes. In these settings, $φ$-test acts as a practical global explanation layer linking Shapley-based importance summaries with classical statistical inference.
