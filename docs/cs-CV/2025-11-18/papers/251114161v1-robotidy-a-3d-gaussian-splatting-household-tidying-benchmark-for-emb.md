**关键词**: `家庭整理基准` `3D高斯溅射` `视觉-语言-动作` `视觉-语言导航` `机器人评估` `端到端系统`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 当前家庭整理基准缺乏用户偏好建模和移动性支持，泛化能力差
2. 提供500个3D高斯溅射场景和大量轨迹，支持视觉-语言-动作与导航训练
3. 部署真实世界应用，建立端到端基准，实现全面评估

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Household tidying is an important application area, yet current benchmarks neither model user preferences nor support mobility, and they generalize poorly, making it hard to comprehensively assess integrated language-to-action capabilities. To address this, we propose RoboTidy, a unified benchmark for language-guided household tidying that supports Vision-Language-Action (VLA) and Vision-Language-Navigation (VLN) training and evaluation. RoboTidy provides 500 photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) household scenes (covering 500 objects and containers) with collisions, formulates tidying as an "Action (Object, Container)" list, and supplies 6.4k high-quality manipulation demonstration trajectories and 1.5k naviagtion trajectories to support both few-shot and large-scale training. We also deploy RoboTidy in the real world for object tidying, establishing an end-to-end benchmark for household tidying. RoboTidy offers a scalable platform and bridges a key gap in embodied AI by enabling holistic and realistic evaluation of language-guided robots.
