## 💡 一句话要点

**提出自动化消防辅助系统，结合无人机与云梯消防车以解决工业火灾定位与灭火难题。**

**关键词**: `无人机辅助消防` `热源检测` `自动化灭火系统` `云梯消防车操作` `火源定位`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 工业火灾中视觉遮挡和火源定位不准确导致灭火效率低、损害增加。
2. 系统使用无人机自主飞行检测热源，并自动控制消防水炮对准火源。
3. 初步测试中系统成功定位多个热源并引导水射流灭火。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Fires in industrial facilities pose special challenges to firefighters, e.g., due to the sheer size and scale of the buildings. The resulting visual obstructions impair firefighting accuracy, further compounded by inaccurate assessments of the fire's location. Such imprecision simultaneously increases the overall damage and prolongs the fire-brigades operation unnecessarily.
>   We propose an automated assistance system for firefighting using a motorized fire monitor on a turntable ladder with aerial support from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV flies autonomously within an obstacle-free flight funnel derived from geodata, detecting and localizing heat sources. An operator supervises the operation on a handheld controller and selects a fire target in reach. After the selection, the UAV automatically plans and traverses between two triangulation poses for continued fire localization. Simultaneously, our system steers the fire monitor to ensure the water jet reaches the detected heat source. In preliminary tests, our assistance system successfully localized multiple heat sources and directed a water jet towards the fires.
