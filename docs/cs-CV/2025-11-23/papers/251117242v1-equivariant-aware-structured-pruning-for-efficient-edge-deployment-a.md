## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper presents a novel framework combining group equivariant convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs) with equivariant-aware structured pruning to produce compact, transformation-invariant models for resource-constrained environments. Equivariance to rotations is achieved through the C4 cyclic group via the e2cnn library,enabling consistent performance under geometric transformations while reducing computational overhead.
>   Our approach introduces structured pruning that preserves equivariant properties by analyzing e2cnn layer structure and applying neuron-level pruning to fully connected components. To mitigate accuracy degradation, we implement adaptive fine-tuning that automatically triggers when accuracy drop exceeds 2%, using early stopping and learning rate scheduling for efficient recovery. The framework includes dynamic INT8 quantization and a comprehensive pipeline encompassing training, knowledge distillation, structured pruning, fine-tuning, and quantization.
>   We evaluate our method on satellite imagery (EuroSAT) and standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10, Rotated MNIST) demonstrating effectiveness across diverse domains. Experimental results show 29.3% parameter reduction with significant accuracy recovery, demonstrating that structured pruning of equivariant networks achieves substantial compression while maintaining geometric robustness. Our pipeline provides a reproducible framework for optimizing equivariant models, bridging the gap between group-theoretic network design and practical deployment constraints, with particular relevance to satellite imagery analysis and geometric vision tasks.
