## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Background:Accurate tooth segmentation from cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images is crucial for digital dentistry but remains challenging in cases of interdental adhesions, which cause severe anatomical shape distortion.
>   Methods:
>   To address this, we propose a deep learning framework that integrates semantic and shape awareness for shape-preserving segmentation. Our method introduces a target-tooth-centroid prompted multi-label learning strategy to model semantic relationships between teeth, reducing shape ambiguity. Additionally, a tooth-shape-aware learning mechanism explicitly enforces morphological constraints to preserve boundary integrity. These components are unified via multi-task learning, jointly optimizing segmentation and shape preservation.
>   Results: Extensive evaluations on internal and external datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods.
>   Conclusions: Our approach effectively mitigates shape distortions and providing anatomically faithful tooth boundaries.
