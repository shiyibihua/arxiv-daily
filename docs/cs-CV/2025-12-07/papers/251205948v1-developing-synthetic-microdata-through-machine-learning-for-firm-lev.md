## 💡 一句话要点

**提出基于机器学习的合成微数据方法，以解决企业调查数据隐私泄露风险。**

**关键词**: `合成数据` `机器学习` `隐私保护` `企业调查` `微数据` `数据科学`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：企业调查数据因缺乏匿名性，易被重新识别，违反保密承诺。
2. 方法要点：使用机器学习模型生成合成数据，保留关键统计特征，不包含真实记录。
3. 实验或效果：通过复制高影响力分析，验证合成数据与真实数据的相似性，探讨应用场景。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Public-use microdata samples (PUMS) from the United States (US) Census Bureau on individuals have been available for decades. However, large increases in computing power and the greater availability of Big Data have dramatically increased the probability of re-identifying anonymized data, potentially violating the pledge of confidentiality given to survey respondents. Data science tools can be used to produce synthetic data that preserve critical moments of the empirical data but do not contain the records of any existing individual respondent or business. Developing public-use firm data from surveys presents unique challenges different from demographic data, because there is a lack of anonymity and certain industries can be easily identified in each geographic area. This paper briefly describes a machine learning model used to construct a synthetic PUMS based on the Annual Business Survey (ABS) and discusses various quality metrics. Although the ABS PUMS is currently being refined and results are confidential, we present two synthetic PUMS developed for the 2007 Survey of Business Owners, similar to the ABS business data. Econometric replication of a high impact analysis published in Small Business Economics demonstrates the verisimilitude of the synthetic data to the true data and motivates discussion of possible ABS use cases.
