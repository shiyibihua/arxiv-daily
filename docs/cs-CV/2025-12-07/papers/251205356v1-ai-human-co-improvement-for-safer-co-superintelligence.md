## 💡 一句话要点

**提出人机协同改进以实现更安全的协同超智能**

**关键词**: `协同超智能` `人机协作` `AI研究` `安全改进` `自我改进`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：AI自我改进存在风险且耗时，需转向更安全高效的目标
2. 方法要点：强调人机协作进行AI研究，从构思到实验共同提升能力
3. 实验或效果：未知，但预期能加速研究并实现更安全的超智能

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Self-improvement is a goal currently exciting the field of AI, but is fraught with danger, and may take time to fully achieve. We advocate that a more achievable and better goal for humanity is to maximize co-improvement: collaboration between human researchers and AIs to achieve co-superintelligence. That is, specifically targeting improving AI systems' ability to work with human researchers to conduct AI research together, from ideation to experimentation, in order to both accelerate AI research and to generally endow both AIs and humans with safer superintelligence through their symbiosis. Focusing on including human research improvement in the loop will both get us there faster, and more safely.
