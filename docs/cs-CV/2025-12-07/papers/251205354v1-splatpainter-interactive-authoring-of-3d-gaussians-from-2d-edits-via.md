## 💡 一句话要点

**提出SplatPainter，通过测试时训练实现从2D编辑交互式创作3D高斯资产**

**关键词**: `3D高斯溅射` `交互式编辑` `测试时训练` `状态感知模型` `2D到3D转换`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有方法在3D高斯资产交互式编辑中速度慢、破坏原始身份或缺乏精细控制
2. 方法要点：使用状态感知前馈模型直接预测高斯属性更新，结合测试时训练实现迭代工作流
3. 实验或效果：支持局部细节优化、局部涂绘和全局重新着色，在交互速度下保持高保真度

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The rise of 3D Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized photorealistic 3D asset creation, yet a critical gap remains for their interactive refinement and editing. Existing approaches based on diffusion or optimization are ill-suited for this task, as they are often prohibitively slow, destructive to the original asset's identity, or lack the precision for fine-grained control. To address this, we introduce \ourmethod, a state-aware feedforward model that enables continuous editing of 3D Gaussian assets from user-provided 2D view(s). Our method directly predicts updates to the attributes of a compact, feature-rich Gaussian representation and leverages Test-Time Training to create a state-aware, iterative workflow. The versatility of our approach allows a single architecture to perform diverse tasks, including high-fidelity local detail refinement, local paint-over, and consistent global recoloring, all at interactive speeds, paving the way for fluid and intuitive 3D content authoring.
