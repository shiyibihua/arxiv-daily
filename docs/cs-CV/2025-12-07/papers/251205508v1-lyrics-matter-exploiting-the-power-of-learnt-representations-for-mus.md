## 💡 一句话要点

**提出HitMusicLyricNet，利用LLM提取歌词嵌入以预测音乐流行度**

**关键词**: `音乐流行度预测` `歌词嵌入` `多模态架构` `LLM应用` `SpotGenTrack数据集`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有研究忽视歌词在音乐流行度预测中的作用，需探索其价值。
2. 方法要点：使用LLM自动提取高维歌词嵌入，结合音频和社交元数据构建多模态架构。
3. 实验或效果：在SpotGenTrack数据集上，MAE和MSE分别提升9%和20%，歌词特征贡献显著。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Accurately predicting music popularity is a critical challenge in the music industry, offering benefits to artists, producers, and streaming platforms. Prior research has largely focused on audio features, social metadata, or model architectures. This work addresses the under-explored role of lyrics in predicting popularity. We present an automated pipeline that uses LLM to extract high-dimensional lyric embeddings, capturing semantic, syntactic, and sequential information. These features are integrated into HitMusicLyricNet, a multimodal architecture that combines audio, lyrics, and social metadata for popularity score prediction in the range 0-100. Our method outperforms existing baselines on the SpotGenTrack dataset, which contains over 100,000 tracks, achieving 9% and 20% improvements in MAE and MSE, respectively. Ablation confirms that gains arise from our LLM-driven lyrics feature pipeline (LyricsAENet), underscoring the value of dense lyric representations.
