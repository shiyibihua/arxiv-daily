**关键词**: `新颖视图合成` `4D场景重建` `多模态数据集` `动态场景` `基准测试`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有新颖视图合成数据集缺乏高质量动态场景和多样化实验设置
2. 方法要点：基于高质量动画电影构建数据集，提供RGB、深度、法线、分割和光流等多模态数据
3. 实验或效果：组织为密集多视图、稀疏相机和单目视频三种基准场景，促进不同数据稀疏度下的模型评估

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper presents a new dataset for Novel View Synthesis, generated from a high-quality, animated film with stunning realism and intricate detail. Our dataset captures a variety of dynamic scenes, complete with detailed textures, lighting, and motion, making it ideal for training and evaluating cutting-edge 4D scene reconstruction and novel view generation models. In addition to high-fidelity RGB images, we provide multiple complementary modalities, including depth, surface normals, object segmentation and optical flow, enabling a deeper understanding of scene geometry and motion. The dataset is organised into three distinct benchmarking scenarios: a dense multi-view camera setup, a sparse camera arrangement, and monocular video sequences, enabling a wide range of experimentation and comparison across varying levels of data sparsity. With its combination of visual richness, high-quality annotations, and diverse experimental setups, this dataset offers a unique resource for pushing the boundaries of view synthesis and 3D vision.
