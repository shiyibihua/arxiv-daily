## 💡 一句话要点

**提出平衡定价策略以在竞争性环境中促进可持续食品选择并减少碳排放**

**关键词**: `可持续食品选择` `定价干预` `碳排放减少` `竞争环境` `现场实验` `平衡策略`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：肉类消费是温室气体排放的主要驱动因素，现有定价干预研究局限于受限环境，缺乏真实竞争场景评估。
2. 方法要点：在瑞士大学校园采用序贯交叉设计，系统比较素食折扣、肉类附加费和组合方案对食品选择的影响。
3. 实验或效果：仅附加费和组合方案显著提升素食餐选择并减少碳排放，组合方案在保持销售稳定下实现有效减排。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Meat consumption is a major driver of global greenhouse gas emissions. While pricing interventions have shown potential to reduce meat intake, previous studies have focused on highly constrained environments with limited consumer choice. Here, we present the first large-scale field experiment to evaluate multiple pricing interventions in a real-world, competitive setting. Using a sequential crossover design with matched menus in a Swiss university campus, we systematically compared vegetarian-meal discounts (-2.5 CHF), meat surcharges (+2.5 CHF), and a combined scheme (-1.2 CHF=+1.2 CHF) across four campus cafeterias. Only the surcharge and combined interventions led to significant increases in vegetarian meal uptake--by 26.4% and 16.6%, respectively--and reduced CO2 emissions per meal by 7.4% and 11.3%, respectively. The surcharge, while effective, triggered a 12.3% drop in sales at intervention sites and a corresponding 14.9% increase in non-treated locations, hence causing a spillover effect that completely offset environmental gains. In contrast, the combined approach achieved meaningful emission reductions without significant effects on overall sales or revenue, making it both effective and economically viable. Notably, pricing interventions were equally effective for both vegetarian-leaning customers and habitual meat-eaters, stimulating change even within entrenched dietary habits. Our results show that balanced pricing strategies can reduce the carbon footprint of realistic food environments, but require coordinated implementation to maximize climate benefits and avoid unintended spillover effects.
