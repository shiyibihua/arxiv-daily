## 💡 一句话要点

**提出基于任意时间有效置信序列的随机梯度下降停止规则，用于凸优化**

**关键词**: `随机梯度下降` `凸优化` `停止规则` `置信序列` `任意时间有效性` `非负超鞅`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：传统SGD分析缺乏在任意时间评估当前迭代接近最优解的统计有效方法
2. 方法要点：通过非负超鞅构建投影SGD加权平均次优性的任意时间有效置信序列，无需平滑性或强凸性
3. 实验或效果：停止规则在概率至少1-α下证明为ε-最优，且在标准步长下几乎必然有限

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We study stopping rules for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for convex optimization from the perspective of anytime-valid confidence sequences. Classical analyses of SGD provide convergence guarantees in expectation or at a fixed horizon, but offer no statistically valid way to assess, at an arbitrary time, how close the current iterate is to the optimum. We develop an anytime-valid, data-dependent upper confidence sequence for the weighted average suboptimality of projected SGD, constructed via nonnegative supermartingales and requiring no smoothness or strong convexity. This confidence sequence yields a simple stopping rule that is provably $\varepsilon$-optimal with probability at least $1-α$ and is almost surely finite under standard stochastic approximation stepsizes. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first rigorous, time-uniform performance guarantees and finite-time $\varepsilon$-optimality certificates for projected SGD with general convex objectives, based solely on observable trajectory quantities.
