## 💡 一句话要点

**评估大语言模型对堕胎耻辱的多层次理解，揭示其缺乏连贯心理生理认知**

**关键词**: `大语言模型评估` `堕胎耻辱` `多层次对齐` `心理生理理解` `AI安全` `偏见检测`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：大语言模型能否真实理解复杂心理生理现象如堕胎耻辱，在认知、人际和结构层次上保持连贯性
2. 方法要点：使用验证过的个体水平堕胎耻辱量表，系统测试五个领先模型在627个多样化人物角色上的表现
3. 实验或效果：模型在所有层次上均未通过真实理解测试，表现出偏差、矛盾和不一致，强调需新设计、评估和治理方法

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> As large language models increasingly mediate stigmatized health decisions, their capacity to genuinely understand complex psychological and physiological phenomena remains poorly evaluated. Can AI understand what we cannot say? We investigate whether LLMs coherently represent abortion stigma across the cognitive, interpersonal, and structural levels where it operates. We systematically tested 627 demographically diverse personas across five leading LLMs using the validated Individual Level Abortion Stigma Scale (ILAS). Our multilevel analysis examined whether models coherently represent stigma at the cognitive level (self-judgment), interpersonal level (anticipated judgment and isolation), and structural level (community condemnation and disclosure patterns), as well as overall stigma. Models fail tests of genuine understanding across all levels. They overestimate interpersonal stigma while underestimating cognitive stigma, assume uniform community condemnation, introduce demographic biases absent from human validation data, miss the empirically validated stigma-secrecy relationship, and contradict themselves within theoretical constructs. These patterns reveal that current alignment approaches ensure appropriate language but not coherent multilevel understanding. This work provides empirical evidence that current LLMs lack coherent multilevel understanding of psychological and physiological constructs. AI safety in high-stakes contexts demands new approaches to design (multilevel coherence), evaluation (continuous auditing), governance and regulation (mandatory audits, accountability, deployment restrictions), and AI literacy in domains where understanding what people cannot say determines whether support helps or harms.
