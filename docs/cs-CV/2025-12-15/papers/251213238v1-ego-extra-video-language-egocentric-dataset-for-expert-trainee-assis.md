## 💡 一句话要点

**提出Ego-EXTRA数据集，以支持专家-学员辅助场景下的视频-语言多模态研究。**

**关键词**: `自我中心视频` `视频-语言对话` `专家-学员辅助` `多模态基准` `视觉问答`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：缺乏高质量专家指导的自我中心视频-语言对话数据集，用于评估多模态助手。
2. 方法要点：采用“Wizard of OZ”范式收集50小时非脚本视频，包含专家从学员视角提供的自然语言反馈。
3. 实验或效果：构建超过15k视觉问答对基准，测试显示当前多模态大语言模型在专家级辅助任务上存在局限。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We present Ego-EXTRA, a video-language Egocentric Dataset for EXpert-TRAinee assistance. Ego-EXTRA features 50 hours of unscripted egocentric videos of subjects performing procedural activities (the trainees) while guided by real-world experts who provide guidance and answer specific questions using natural language. Following a ``Wizard of OZ'' data collection paradigm, the expert enacts a wearable intelligent assistant, looking at the activities performed by the trainee exclusively from their egocentric point of view, answering questions when asked by the trainee, or proactively interacting with suggestions during the procedures. This unique data collection protocol enables Ego-EXTRA to capture a high-quality dialogue in which expert-level feedback is provided to the trainee. Two-way dialogues between experts and trainees are recorded, transcribed, and used to create a novel benchmark comprising more than 15k high-quality Visual Question Answer sets, which we use to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models. The results show that Ego-EXTRA is challenging and highlight the limitations of current models when used to provide expert-level assistance to the user. The Ego-EXTRA dataset is publicly available to support the benchmark of egocentric video-language assistants: https://fpv-iplab.github.io/Ego-EXTRA/.
