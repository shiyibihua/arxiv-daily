## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Mobile sensing systems have long faced a fundamental trade-off between
> sensing quality and efficiency due to constraints in computation, power, and
> other limitations. Sparse sensing, which aims to acquire and process only a
> subset of sensor data, has been a key strategy for maintaining performance
> under such constraints. However, existing sparse sensing methods often suffer
> from reduced accuracy, as missing information across space and time introduces
> uncertainty into many sensing systems. In this work, we investigate whether
> foundation models can change the landscape of mobile sparse sensing. Using
> real-world mobile AR data, our evaluations demonstrate that foundation models
> offer significant improvements in geometry-aware image warping, a central
> technique for enabling accurate reuse of cross-frame information. Furthermore,
> our study demonstrates the scalability of foundation model-based sparse sensing
> and shows its leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction. Collectively, our
> study reveals critical aspects of the promises and the open challenges of
> integrating foundation models into mobile sparse sensing systems.
