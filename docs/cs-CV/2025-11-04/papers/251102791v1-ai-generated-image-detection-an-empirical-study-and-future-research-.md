## 💡 一句话要点

**提出统一基准框架以系统评估AI生成图像检测方法。**

**关键词**: `AI生成图像检测` `多媒体取证` `基准评估` `模型泛化性` `可解释性分析`

## 📋 核心要点

1. AI生成图像威胁多媒体取证，现有方法存在基准不统一等问题。
2. 引入统一框架，评估十种方法在七个数据集上的性能与可解释性。
3. 实验显示方法泛化性差异大，部分方法跨模型迁移能力下降。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The threats posed by AI-generated media, particularly deepfakes, are now
> raising significant challenges for multimedia forensics, misinformation
> detection, and biometric system resulting in erosion of public trust in the
> legal system, significant increase in frauds, and social engineering attacks.
> Although several forensic methods have been proposed, they suffer from three
> critical gaps: (i) use of non-standardized benchmarks with GAN- or
> diffusion-generated images, (ii) inconsistent training protocols (e.g.,
> scratch, frozen, fine-tuning), and (iii) limited evaluation metrics that fail
> to capture generalization and explainability. These limitations hinder fair
> comparison, obscure true robustness, and restrict deployment in
> security-critical applications. This paper introduces a unified benchmarking
> framework for systematic evaluation of forensic methods under controlled and
> reproducible conditions. We benchmark ten SoTA forensic methods (scratch,
> frozen, and fine-tuned) and seven publicly available datasets (GAN and
> diffusion) to perform extensive and systematic evaluations. We evaluate
> performance using multiple metrics, including accuracy, average precision,
> ROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity. We also further analyze model
> interpretability using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps. Our evaluations
> demonstrate substantial variability in generalization, with certain methods
> exhibiting strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model
> transferability. This study aims to guide the research community toward a
> deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of current forensic
> approaches, and to inspire the development of more robust, generalizable, and
> explainable solutions.
