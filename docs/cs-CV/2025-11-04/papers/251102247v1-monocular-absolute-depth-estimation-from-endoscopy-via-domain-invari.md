## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is a critical task to guide autonomous
> medical robots. However, obtaining absolute (metric) depth from an endoscopy
> camera in surgical scenes is difficult, which limits supervised learning of
> depth on real endoscopic images. Current image-level unsupervised domain
> adaptation methods translate synthetic images with known depth maps into the
> style of real endoscopic frames and train depth networks using these translated
> images with their corresponding depth maps. However a domain gap often remains
> between real and translated synthetic images. In this paper, we present a
> latent feature alignment method to improve absolute depth estimation by
> reducing this domain gap in the context of endoscopic videos of the central
> airway. Our methods are agnostic to the image translation process and focus on
> the depth estimation itself. Specifically, the depth network takes translated
> synthetic and real endoscopic frames as input and learns latent
> domain-invariant features via adversarial learning and directional feature
> consistency. The evaluation is conducted on endoscopic videos of central airway
> phantoms with manually aligned absolute depth maps. Compared to
> state-of-the-art MDE methods, our approach achieves superior performance on
> both absolute and relative depth metrics, and consistently improves results
> across various backbones and pretrained weights. Our code is available at
