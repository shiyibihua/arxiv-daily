## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We propose MIRA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate models in scenarios
> where generating intermediate visual images is essential for successful
> reasoning. Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in
> MIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as
> sketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning
> process. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through
> "drawing to think". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically
> challenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning
> steps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our
> evaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems,
> annotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a
> unified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation
> input: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with
> image and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image
> clues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity
> on our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under
> different k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large
> language models, including strongest private models as well as strong
> open-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts.
> However, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves
> consistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and
> tasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and
> designing textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited
> improvements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the
> critical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning
> on MIRA.
