## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Recent advances in multi-modal models have demonstrated strong performance in
> tasks such as image generation and reasoning. However, applying these models to
> the fire domain remains challenging due to the lack of publicly available
> datasets with high-quality fire domain annotations. To address this gap, we
> introduce DetectiumFire, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset comprising of 22.5k
> high-resolution fire-related images and 2.5k real-world fire-related videos
> covering a wide range of fire types, environments, and risk levels. The data
> are annotated with both traditional computer vision labels (e.g., bounding
> boxes) and detailed textual prompts describing the scene, enabling applications
> such as synthetic data generation and fire risk reasoning. DetectiumFire offers
> clear advantages over existing benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data
> quality, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing coverage of real-world
> scenarios. We validate the utility of DetectiumFire across multiple tasks,
> including object detection, diffusion-based image generation, and
> vision-language reasoning. Our results highlight the potential of this dataset
> to advance fire-related research and support the development of intelligent
> safety systems. We release DetectiumFire to promote broader exploration of fire
> understanding in the AI community. The dataset is available at
