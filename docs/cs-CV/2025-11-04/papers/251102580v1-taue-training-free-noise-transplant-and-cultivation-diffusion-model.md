## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Despite the remarkable success of text-to-image diffusion models, their
> output of a single, flattened image remains a critical bottleneck for
> professional applications requiring layer-wise control. Existing solutions
> either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are
> training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing
> to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the
> Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a
> novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique,
> Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent
> representations from both foreground and composite generation processes,
> transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures
> semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite
> layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring
> fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our
> training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods,
> enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and
> fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but
> also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional
> editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative
> workflows.
