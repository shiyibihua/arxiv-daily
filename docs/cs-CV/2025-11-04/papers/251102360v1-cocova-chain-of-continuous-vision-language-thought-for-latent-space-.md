## 📄 摘要（原文）

> In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and
> beyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world
> in multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain
> constrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic
> tokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual
> perception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous
> Vision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that
> leverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.
> The core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent
> Q-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a
> chain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this
> process, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual
> regions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain
> grounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines
> contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment
> between latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.
> Evaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong
> baselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B
> models on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains
> competitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that
> learned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns,
> highlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between
> discrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.
