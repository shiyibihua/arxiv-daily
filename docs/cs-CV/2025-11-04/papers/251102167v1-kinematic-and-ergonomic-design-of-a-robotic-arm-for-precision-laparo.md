## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Robotic assistance in minimally invasive surgery can greatly enhance surgical
> precision and reduce surgeon fatigue. This paper presents a focused
> investigation on the kinematic and ergonomic design principles for a
> laparoscopic surgical robotic arm aimed at high-precision tasks. We propose a
> 7-degree-of-freedom (7-DOF) robotic arm system that incorporates a remote
> center of motion (RCM) at the instrument insertion point and ergonomic
> considerations to improve surgeon interaction. The design is implemented on a
> general-purpose robotic platform, and a series of simulated surgical tasks were
> performed to evaluate targeting accuracy, task efficiency, and surgeon comfort
> compared to conventional manual laparoscopy. Experimental results demonstrate
> that the optimized robotic design achieves significantly improved targeting
> accuracy (error reduced by over 50%) and shorter task completion times, while
> substantially lowering operator muscle strain and discomfort. These findings
> validate the importance of kinematic optimization (such as added articulations
> and tremor filtering) and human-centered ergonomic design in enhancing the
> performance of robot-assisted surgery. The insights from this work can guide
> the development of next-generation surgical robots that improve surgical
> outcomes and ergonomics for the operating team.
