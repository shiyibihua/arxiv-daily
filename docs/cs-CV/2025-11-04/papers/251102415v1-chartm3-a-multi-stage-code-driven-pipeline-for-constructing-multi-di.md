## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Complex chart understanding tasks demand advanced visual recognition and
> reasoning capabilities from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However,
> current research provides limited coverage of complex chart scenarios and
> computation-intensive reasoning tasks prevalent in real-world applications.
> This study proposes an automated multi-stage code-driven pipeline for
> systematically generating visual reasoning datasets to address these
> limitations. The pipeline integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to
> retrieve professional chart templates and employs chain-of-thought (CoT)
> strategies to generate reasoning codes that simulate real data distributions,
> thereby driving chart rendering and question-related statistical computations.
> Through model-based evaluation, the pipeline enhances chart diversity and data
> quality. Using this framework, we construct ChartM$^3$, a multi-dimensional and
> multi-step dataset containing 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs for training, along
> with 2,871 high-quality evaluation samples for enabling practical performance
> assessment. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL)
> experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves reasoning
> capabilities and cross-domain generalization performance, enabling smaller
> models to achieve performance comparable to larger-scale models in complex
> chart comprehension.
