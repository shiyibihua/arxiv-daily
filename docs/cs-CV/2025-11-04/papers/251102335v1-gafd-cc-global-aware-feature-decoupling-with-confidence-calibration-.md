## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is paramount to ensuring the reliability
> and robustness of learning models in real-world applications. Existing post-hoc
> OOD detection methods detect OOD samples by leveraging their features and
> logits information without retraining. However, they often overlook the
> inherent correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for
> effective OOD detection. To address this limitation, we propose Global-Aware
> Feature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration (GAFD-CC). GAFD-CC aims to
> refine decision boundaries and increase discriminative performance. Firstly, it
> performs global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights. This
> involves aligning features with the direction of global classification weights
> to decouple them. From this, GAFD-CC extracts two types of critical
> information: positively correlated features that promote in-distribution
> (ID)/OOD boundary refinement and negatively correlated features that suppress
> false positives and tighten these boundaries. Secondly, it adaptively fuses
> these decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for
> comprehensive and robust OOD detection. Extensive experiments on large-scale
> benchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong
> generalization ability compared to those of state-of-the-art methods.
