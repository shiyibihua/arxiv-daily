## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis heavily relies on amyloid-beta
> positron emission tomography (Abeta-PET), which is limited by high cost and
> limited accessibility. This study explores whether Abeta-PET spatial patterns
> can be predicted from blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) and MRI scans. Methods: We
> collected Abeta-PET images, T1-weighted MRI scans, and BBMs from 566
> participants. A language-enhanced generative model, driven by a large language
> model (LLM) and multimodal information fusion, was developed to synthesize PET
> images. Synthesized images were evaluated for image quality, diagnostic
> consistency, and clinical applicability within a fully automated diagnostic
> pipeline. Findings: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans in
> both structural details (SSIM = 0.920 +/- 0.003) and regional patterns
> (Pearson's r = 0.955 +/- 0.007). Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show
> high agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80). Using synthetic
> PET, we developed a fully automatic AD diagnostic pipeline integrating PET
> synthesis and classification. The synthetic PET-based model (AUC = 0.78)
> outperforms T1-based (AUC = 0.68) and BBM-based (AUC = 0.73) models, while
> combining synthetic PET and BBMs further improved performance (AUC = 0.79).
> Ablation analysis supports the advantages of LLM integration and prompt
> engineering. Interpretation: Our language-enhanced generative model synthesizes
> realistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and BBMs for Abeta spatial
> pattern assessment and improving the diagnostic workflow for Alzheimer's
> disease.
