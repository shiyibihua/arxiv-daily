## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Video Understanding, Scene Interpretation and Commonsense Reasoning are
> highly challenging tasks enabling the interpretation of visual information,
> allowing agents to perceive, interact with and make rational decisions in its
> environment. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs)
> have shown remarkable advancements in these areas in recent years, enabling
> domain-specific applications as well as zero-shot open vocabulary tasks,
> combining multiple domains. However, the required computational complexity
> poses challenges for their application on edge devices and in the context of
> Mobile Robotics, especially considering the trade-off between accuracy and
> inference time. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of
> state-of-the-art VLMs for the task of Scene Interpretation and Action
> Recognition, with special regard to small VLMs capable of being deployed to
> edge devices in the context of Mobile Robotics. The proposed pipeline is
> evaluated on a diverse dataset consisting of various real-world cityscape,
> on-campus and indoor scenarios. The experimental evaluation discusses the
> potential of these small models on edge devices, with particular emphasis on
> challenges, weaknesses, inherent model biases and the application of the gained
> information. Supplementary material is provided via the following repository:
