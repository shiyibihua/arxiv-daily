## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Understanding and mitigating flicker effects caused by rapid variations in
> light intensity is critical for enhancing the performance of event cameras in
> diverse environments. This paper introduces an innovative autonomous mechanism
> for tuning the biases of event cameras, effectively addressing flicker across a
> wide frequency range -25 Hz to 500 Hz. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
> additional hardware or software for flicker filtering, our approach leverages
> the event cameras inherent bias settings. Utilizing a simple Convolutional
> Neural Networks -CNNs, the system identifies instances of flicker in a spatial
> space and dynamically adjusts specific biases to minimize its impact. The
> efficacy of this autobiasing system was robustly tested using a face detector
> framework under both well-lit and low-light conditions, as well as across
> various frequencies. The results demonstrated significant improvements:
> enhanced YOLO confidence metrics for face detection, and an increased
> percentage of frames capturing detected faces. Moreover, the average gradient,
> which serves as an indicator of flicker presence through edge detection,
> decreased by 38.2 percent in well-lit conditions and by 53.6 percent in
> low-light conditions. These findings underscore the potential of our approach
> to significantly improve the functionality of event cameras in a range of
> adverse lighting scenarios.
