## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Suckers are significant for robots in picking, transferring, manipulation and
> locomotion on diverse surfaces. However, most of the existing suckers lack
> high-fidelity perceptual and tactile sensing, which impedes them from resolving
> the fine-grained geometric features and interaction status of the target
> surface. This limits their robust performance with irregular objects and in
> complex, unstructured environments. Inspired by the adaptive structure and
> high-performance sensory capabilities of cephalopod suckers, in this paper, we
> propose a novel, intelligent sucker, named SuckTac, that integrates a
> camera-based tactile sensor directly within its optimized structure to provide
> high-density perception and robust suction. Specifically, through joint
> structure design and optimization and based on a multi-material integrated
> casting technique, a camera and light source are embedded into the sucker,
> which enables in-situ, high-density perception of fine details like surface
> shape, texture and roughness. To further enhance robustness and adaptability,
> the sucker's mechanical design is also optimized by refining its profile,
> adding a compliant lip, and incorporating surface microstructure. Extensive
> experiments, including challenging tasks such as robotic cloth manipulation and
> soft mobile robot inspection, demonstrate the superior performance and broad
> applicability of the proposed system.
