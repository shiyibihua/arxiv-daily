## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper presents a quantitative comparison between centralised and
> distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) architectures for
> controlling a soft robotic arm modelled as a Cosserat rod in simulation. Using
> PyElastica and the OpenAI Gym interface, we train both a global Proximal Policy
> Optimisation (PPO) controller and a Multi-Agent PPO (MAPPO) under identical
> budgets. Both approaches are based on the arm having $n$ number of controlled
> sections. The study systematically varies $n$ and evaluates the performance of
> the arm to reach a fixed target in three scenarios: default baseline condition,
> recovery from external disturbance, and adaptation to actuator failure.
> Quantitative metrics used for the evaluation are mean action magnitude, mean
> final distance, mean episode length, and success rate. The results show that
> there are no significant benefits of the distributed policy when the number of
> controlled sections $n\le4$. In very simple systems, when $n\le2$, the
> centralised policy outperforms the distributed one. When $n$ increases to $4<
> n\le 12$, the distributed policy shows a high sample efficiency. In these
> systems, distributed policy promotes a stronger success rate, resilience, and
> robustness under local observability and yields faster convergence given the
> same sample size. However, centralised policies achieve much higher time
> efficiency during training as it takes much less time to train the same size of
> samples. These findings highlight the trade-offs between centralised and
> distributed policy in reinforcement learning-based control for soft robotic
> systems and provide actionable design guidance for future sim-to-real transfer
> in soft rod-like manipulators.
