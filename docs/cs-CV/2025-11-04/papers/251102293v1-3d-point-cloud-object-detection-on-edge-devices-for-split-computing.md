## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The field of autonomous driving technology is rapidly advancing, with deep
> learning being a key component. Particularly in the field of sensing, 3D point
> cloud data collected by LiDAR is utilized to run deep neural network models for
> 3D object detection. However, these state-of-the-art models are complex,
> leading to longer processing times and increased power consumption on edge
> devices. The objective of this study is to address these issues by leveraging
> Split Computing, a distributed machine learning inference method. Split
> Computing aims to lessen the computational burden on edge devices, thereby
> reducing processing time and power consumption. Furthermore, it minimizes the
> risk of data breaches by only transmitting intermediate data from the deep
> neural network model. Experimental results show that splitting after
> voxelization reduces the inference time by 70.8% and the edge device execution
> time by 90.0%. When splitting within the network, the inference time is reduced
> by up to 57.1%, and the edge device execution time is reduced by up to 69.5%.
