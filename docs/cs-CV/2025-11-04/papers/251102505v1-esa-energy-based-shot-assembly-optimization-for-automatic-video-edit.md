## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Shot assembly is a crucial step in film production and video editing,
> involving the sequencing and arrangement of shots to construct a narrative,
> convey information, or evoke emotions. Traditionally, this process has been
> manually executed by experienced editors. While current intelligent video
> editing technologies can handle some automated video editing tasks, they often
> fail to capture the creator's unique artistic expression in shot assembly.To
> address this challenge, we propose an energy-based optimization method for
> video shot assembly. Specifically, we first perform visual-semantic matching
> between the script generated by a large language model and a video library to
> obtain subsets of candidate shots aligned with the script semantics. Next, we
> segment and label the shots from reference videos, extracting attributes such
> as shot size, camera motion, and semantics. We then employ energy-based models
> to learn from these attributes, scoring candidate shot sequences based on their
> alignment with reference styles. Finally, we achieve shot assembly optimization
> by combining multiple syntax rules, producing videos that align with the
> assembly style of the reference videos. Our method not only automates the
> arrangement and combination of independent shots according to specific logic,
> narrative requirements, or artistic styles but also learns the assembly style
> of reference videos, creating a coherent visual sequence or holistic visual
> expression. With our system, even users with no prior video editing experience
> can create visually compelling videos. Project page:
