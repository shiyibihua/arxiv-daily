## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Shearography is a non-destructive testing method for detecting subsurface
> defects, offering high sensitivity and full-field inspection capabilities.
> However, its industrial adoption remains limited due to the need for expert
> interpretation. To reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation, this
> study explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in
> shearographic images. Three architectures are evaluated: a fully connected
> autoencoder, a convolutional autoencoder, and a student-teacher feature
> matching model. All models are trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled
> dataset was developed using a custom specimen with reproducible defect
> patterns, enabling systematic acquisition of shearographic measurements under
> both ideal and realistic deformation conditions. Two training subsets were
> defined: one containing only undistorted, defect-free samples, and one
> additionally including globally deformed, yet defect-free, data. The latter
> simulates practical inspection conditions by incorporating deformation-induced
> fringe patterns that may obscure localized anomalies. The models are evaluated
> in terms of binary classification and, for the student-teacher model, spatial
> defect localization. Results show that the student-teacher approach achieves
> superior classification robustness and enables precise localization. Compared
> to the autoencoder-based models, it demonstrates improved separability of
> feature representations, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings. Additionally,
> a YOLOv8 model trained on labeled defect data serves as a reference to
> benchmark localization quality. This study underscores the potential of
> unsupervised deep learning for scalable, label-efficient shearographic
> inspection in industrial environments.
