**关键词**: `语义分割` `合成数据生成` `农业机器人` `域适应` `Blender模拟`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：真实农田图像标注成本高，合成数据与真实图像存在域差距。
2. 方法要点：使用Blender程序化生成多样条件下的合成图像，包括植物生长、杂草密度等。
3. 实验或效果：合成数据训练模型在跨域泛化中优于真实数据，sim-to-real差距为10%。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Precise semantic segmentation of crops and weeds is necessary for
> agricultural weeding robots. However, training deep learning models requires
> large annotated datasets, which are costly to obtain in real fields. Synthetic
> data can reduce this burden, but the gap between simulated and real images
> remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a pipeline for procedural
> generation of synthetic crop-weed images using Blender, producing annotated
> datasets under diverse conditions of plant growth, weed density, lighting, and
> camera angle. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models on
> synthetic and real datasets and analyze their cross-domain generalization. Our
> results show that training on synthetic images leads to a sim-to-real gap of
> 10%, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, synthetic data
> demonstrates good generalization properties, outperforming real datasets in
> cross-domain scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic
> agricultural datasets and support hybrid strategies for more efficient model
> training.
