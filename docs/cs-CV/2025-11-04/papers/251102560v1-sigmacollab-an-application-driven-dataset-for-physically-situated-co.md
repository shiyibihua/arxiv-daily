## 💡 一句话要点

**提出SigmaCollab数据集以支持物理情境下的人机协作研究**

**关键词**: `人机协作` `多模态数据集` `混合现实` `物理情境任务` `AI辅助系统`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：物理情境下人机协作缺乏真实多模态数据支持
2. 方法要点：收集85个会话，包含音频、视觉、追踪等多模态数据
3. 实验或效果：提供约14小时数据，用于构建混合现实任务基准

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We introduce SigmaCollab, a dataset enabling research on physically situated
> human-AI collaboration. The dataset consists of a set of 85 sessions in which
> untrained participants were guided by a mixed-reality assistive AI agent in
> performing procedural tasks in the physical world. SigmaCollab includes a set
> of rich, multimodal data streams, such as the participant and system audio,
> egocentric camera views from the head-mounted device, depth maps, head, hand
> and gaze tracking information, as well as additional annotations performed
> post-hoc. While the dataset is relatively small in size (~ 14 hours), its
> application-driven and interactive nature brings to the fore novel research
> challenges for human-AI collaboration, and provides more realistic testing
> grounds for various AI models operating in this space. In future work, we plan
> to use the dataset to construct a set of benchmarks for physically situated
> collaboration in mixed-reality task assistive scenarios. SigmaCollab is
> available at https://github.com/microsoft/SigmaCollab.
