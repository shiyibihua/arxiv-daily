## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Recent advancements in Deep Learning enable hardware-based cognitive systems,
> that is, mechatronic systems in general and robotics in particular with
> integrated Artificial Intelligence, to interact with dynamic and unstructured
> environments. While the results are impressive, the application of such systems
> to critical tasks like autonomous driving as well as service and care robotics
> necessitate the evaluation of large amount of heterogeneous data. Automated
> report generation for Mobile Robotics can play a crucial role in facilitating
> the evaluation and acceptance of such systems in various domains. In this
> paper, we propose a pipeline for generating automated reports in natural
> language utilizing various multi-modal sensors that solely relies on local
> models capable of being deployed on edge computing devices, thus preserving the
> privacy of all actors involved and eliminating the need for external services.
> In particular, we evaluate our implementation on a diverse dataset spanning
> multiple domains including indoor, outdoor and urban environments, providing
> quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation results. Various generated
> example reports and other supplementary materials are available via a public
> repository.
