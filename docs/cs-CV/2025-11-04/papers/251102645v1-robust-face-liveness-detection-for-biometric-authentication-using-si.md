## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Biometric technologies are widely adopted in security, legal, and financial
> systems. Face recognition can authenticate a person based on the unique facial
> features such as shape and texture. However, recent works have demonstrated the
> vulnerability of Face Recognition Systems (FRS) towards presentation attacks.
> Using spoofing (aka.,presentation attacks), a malicious actor can get
> illegitimate access to secure systems. This paper proposes a novel light-weight
> CNN framework to identify print/display, video and wrap attacks. The proposed
> robust architecture provides seamless liveness detection ensuring faster
> biometric authentication (1-2 seconds on CPU). Further, this also presents a
> newly created 2D spoof attack dataset consisting of more than 500 videos
> collected from 60 subjects. To validate the effectiveness of this architecture,
> we provide a demonstration video depicting print/display, video and wrap attack
> detection approaches. The demo can be viewed in the following link:
