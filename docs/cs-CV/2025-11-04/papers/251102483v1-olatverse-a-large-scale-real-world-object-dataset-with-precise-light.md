## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We introduce OLATverse, a large-scale dataset comprising around 9M images of
> 765 real-world objects, captured from multiple viewpoints under a diverse set
> of precisely controlled lighting conditions. While recent advances in
> object-centric inverse rendering, novel view synthesis and relighting have
> shown promising results, most techniques still heavily rely on the synthetic
> datasets for training and small-scale real-world datasets for benchmarking,
> which limits their realism and generalization. To address this gap, OLATverse
> offers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real
> objects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations.
> Specifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects,
> spanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35
> DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the
> simulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we
> provide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric
> surface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct
> an extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world
> object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation. We
> believe that OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating the next
> generation of inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data.
> The full dataset, along with all post-processing workflows, will be publicly
> released at https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/OLATverse/.
