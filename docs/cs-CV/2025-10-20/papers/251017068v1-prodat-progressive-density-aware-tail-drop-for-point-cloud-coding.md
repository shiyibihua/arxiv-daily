## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Three-dimensional (3D) point clouds are becoming increasingly vital in
> applications such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, and immersive
> communication, demanding real-time processing and low latency. However, their
> large data volumes and bandwidth constraints hinder the deployment of
> high-quality services in resource-limited environments. Progres- sive coding,
> which allows for decoding at varying levels of detail, provides an alternative
> by allowing initial partial decoding with subsequent refinement. Although
> recent learning-based point cloud geometry coding methods have achieved notable
> success, their fixed latent representation does not support progressive
> decoding. To bridge this gap, we propose ProDAT, a novel density-aware
> tail-drop mechanism for progressive point cloud coding. By leveraging density
> information as a guidance signal, latent features and coordinates are decoded
> adaptively based on their significance, therefore achieving progressive
> decoding at multiple bitrates using one single model. Experimental results on
> benchmark datasets show that the proposed ProDAT not only enables progressive
> coding but also achieves superior coding efficiency compared to
> state-of-the-art learning-based coding techniques, with over 28.6% BD-rate
> improvement for PSNR- D2 on SemanticKITTI and over 18.15% for ShapeNet
