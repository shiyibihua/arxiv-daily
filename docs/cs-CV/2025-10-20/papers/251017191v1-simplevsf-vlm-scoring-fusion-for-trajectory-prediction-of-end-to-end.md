## 📄 摘要（原文）

> End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising paradigm for
> achieving robust and intelligent driving policies. However, existing end-to-end
> methods still face significant challenges, such as suboptimal decision-making
> in complex scenarios. In this paper,we propose SimpleVSF (Simple VLM-Scoring
> Fusion), a novel framework that enhances end-to-end planning by leveraging the
> cognitive capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and advanced trajectory
> fusion techniques. We utilize the conventional scorers and the novel
> VLM-enhanced scorers. And we leverage a robust weight fusioner for quantitative
> aggregation and a powerful VLM-based fusioner for qualitative, context-aware
> decision-making. As the leading approach in the ICCV 2025 NAVSIM v2 End-to-End
> Driving Challenge, our SimpleVSF framework demonstrates state-of-the-art
> performance, achieving a superior balance between safety, comfort, and
> efficiency.
