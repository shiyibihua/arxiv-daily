## 💡 一句话要点

**提出MT-Video-Bench基准以评估多模态大语言模型在多轮视频对话中的表现**

**关键词**: `多模态大语言模型` `视频理解` `多轮对话` `基准评估` `交互能力` `感知能力`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 现有基准局限于单轮问答，无法评估多轮对话的复杂性
2. 构建包含987个多轮对话的基准，评估感知与交互等六项核心能力
3. 评估显示开源与闭源模型在多轮视频对话中存在显著性能差距

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The recent development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
> significantly advanced AI's ability to understand visual modalities. However,
> existing evaluation benchmarks remain limited to single-turn question
> answering, overlooking the complexity of multi-turn dialogues in real-world
> scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MT-Video-Bench, a holistic video
> understanding benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in multi-turn dialogues.
> Specifically, our MT-Video-Bench mainly assesses six core competencies that
> focus on perceptivity and interactivity, encompassing 987 meticulously curated
> multi-turn dialogues from diverse domains. These capabilities are rigorously
> aligned with real-world applications, such as interactive sports analysis and
> multi-turn video-based intelligent tutoring. With MT-Video-Bench, we
> extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source
> MLLMs, revealing their significant performance discrepancies and limitations in
> handling multi-turn video dialogues. The benchmark will be publicly available
> to foster future research.
