## 💡 一句话要点

**提出基于多表情特征融合与自适应类平衡的方法，用于帕金森病严重程度诊断。**

**关键词**: `帕金森病诊断` `面部表情分析` `特征融合` `类不平衡处理` `注意力机制` `多分类任务`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：单表情诊断易误诊，类不平衡影响多阶段PD严重程度预测性能。
2. 方法要点：采用注意力机制融合多表情特征，动态调整样本贡献以平衡类别。
3. 实验或效果：实验显示方法在PD严重程度诊断中表现优异，验证了融合与平衡策略有效性。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Parkinson's disease (PD) severity diagnosis is crucial for early detecting
> potential patients and adopting tailored interventions. Diagnosing PD based on
> facial expression is grounded in PD patients' "masked face" symptom and gains
> growing interest recently for its convenience and affordability. However,
> current facial expression-based approaches often rely on single type of
> expression which can lead to misdiagnosis, and ignore the class imbalance
> across different PD stages which degrades the prediction performance. Moreover,
> most existing methods focus on binary classification (i.e., PD / non-PD) rather
> than diagnosing the severity of PD. To address these issues, we propose a new
> facial expression-based method for PD severity diagnosis which integrates
> multiple facial expression features through attention-based feature fusion.
> Moreover, we mitigate the class imbalance problem via an adaptive class
> balancing strategy which dynamically adjusts the contribution of training
> samples based on their class distribution and classification difficulty.
> Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed
> method for PD severity diagnosis, as well as the efficacy of attention-based
> feature fusion and adaptive class balancing.
