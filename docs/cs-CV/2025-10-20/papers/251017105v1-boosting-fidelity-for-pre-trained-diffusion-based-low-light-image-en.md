## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Diffusion-based methods, leveraging pre-trained large models like Stable
> Diffusion via ControlNet, have achieved remarkable performance in several
> low-level vision tasks. However, Pre-Trained Diffusion-Based (PTDB) methods
> often sacrifice content fidelity to attain higher perceptual realism. This
> issue is exacerbated in low-light scenarios, where severely degraded
> information caused by the darkness limits effective control. We identify two
> primary causes of fidelity loss: the absence of suitable conditional latent
> modeling and the lack of bidirectional interaction between the conditional
> latent and noisy latent in the diffusion process. To address this, we propose a
> novel optimization strategy for conditioning in pre-trained diffusion models,
> enhancing fidelity while preserving realism and aesthetics. Our method
> introduces a mechanism to recover spatial details lost during VAE encoding,
> i.e., a latent refinement pipeline incorporating generative priors.
> Additionally, the refined latent condition interacts dynamically with the noisy
> latent, leading to improved restoration performance. Our approach is
> plug-and-play, seamlessly integrating into existing diffusion networks to
> provide more effective control. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
> fidelity improvements in PTDB methods.
