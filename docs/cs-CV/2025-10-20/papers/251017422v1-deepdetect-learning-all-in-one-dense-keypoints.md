## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Keypoint detection is the foundation of many computer vision tasks, including
> image registration, structure-from motion, 3D reconstruction, visual odometry,
> and SLAM. Traditional detectors (SIFT, SURF, ORB, BRISK, etc.) and learning
> based methods (SuperPoint, R2D2, LF-Net, D2-Net, etc.) have shown strong
> performance yet suffer from key limitations: sensitivity to photometric
> changes, low keypoint density and repeatability, limited adaptability to
> challenging scenes, and lack of semantic understanding, often failing to
> prioritize visually important regions. We present DeepDetect, an intelligent,
> all-in-one, dense keypoint detector that unifies the strengths of classical
> detectors using deep learning. Firstly, we create ground-truth masks by fusing
> outputs of 7 keypoint and 2 edge detectors, extracting diverse visual cues from
> corners and blobs to prominent edges and textures in the images. Afterwards, a
> lightweight and efficient model: ESPNet, is trained using these masks as
> labels, enabling DeepDetect to focus semantically on images while producing
> highly dense keypoints, that are adaptable to diverse and visually degraded
> conditions. Evaluations on the Oxford Affine Covariant Regions dataset
> demonstrate that DeepDetect surpasses other detectors in keypoint density,
> repeatability, and the number of correct matches, achieving maximum values of
> 0.5143 (average keypoint density), 0.9582 (average repeatability), and 59,003
> (correct matches).
