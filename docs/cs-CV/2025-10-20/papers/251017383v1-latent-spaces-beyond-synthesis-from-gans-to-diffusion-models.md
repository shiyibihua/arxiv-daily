## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper examines the evolving nature of internal representations in
> generative visual models, focusing on the conceptual and technical shift from
> GANs and VAEs to diffusion-based architectures. Drawing on Beatrice Fazi's
> account of synthesis as the amalgamation of distributed representations, we
> propose a distinction between "synthesis in a strict sense", where a compact
> latent space wholly determines the generative process, and "synthesis in a
> broad sense," which characterizes models whose representational labor is
> distributed across layers. Through close readings of model architectures and a
> targeted experimental setup that intervenes in layerwise representations, we
> show how diffusion models fragment the burden of representation and thereby
> challenge assumptions of unified internal space. By situating these findings
> within media theoretical frameworks and critically engaging with metaphors such
> as the latent space and the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we argue for a
> reorientation of how generative AI is understood: not as a direct synthesis of
> content, but as an emergent configuration of specialized processes.
