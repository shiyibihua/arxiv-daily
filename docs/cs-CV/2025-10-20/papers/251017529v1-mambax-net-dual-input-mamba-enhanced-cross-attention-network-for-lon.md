## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Active Surveillance (AS) is a treatment option for managing low and
> intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa), aiming to avoid overtreatment while
> monitoring disease progression through serial MRI and clinical follow-up.
> Accurate prostate segmentation is an important preliminary step for automating
> this process, enabling automated detection and diagnosis of PCa. However,
> existing deep-learning segmentation models are often trained on
> single-time-point and expertly annotated datasets, making them unsuitable for
> longitudinal AS analysis, where multiple time points and a scarcity of expert
> labels hinder their effective fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we
> propose MambaX-Net, a novel semi-supervised, dual-scan 3D segmentation
> architecture that computes the segmentation for time point t by leveraging the
> MRI and the corresponding segmentation mask from the previous time point. We
> introduce two new components: (i) a Mamba-enhanced Cross-Attention Module,
> which integrates the Mamba block into cross attention to efficiently capture
> temporal evolution and long-range spatial dependencies, and (ii) a Shape
> Extractor Module that encodes the previous segmentation mask into a latent
> anatomical representation for refined zone delination. Moreover, we introduce a
> semi-supervised self-training strategy that leverages pseudo-labels generated
> from a pre-trained nnU-Net, enabling effective learning without expert
> annotations. MambaX-Net was evaluated on a longitudinal AS dataset, and results
> showed that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art U-Net and
> Transformer-based models, achieving superior prostate zone segmentation even
> when trained on limited and noisy data.
