## 📄 摘要（原文）

> With the rapid growth of bike sharing and the increasing diversity of cycling
> applications, accurate bicycle localization has become essential. traditional
> GNSS-based methods suffer from multipath effects, while existing inertial
> navigation approaches rely on precise modeling and show limited robustness.
> Tight Learned Inertial Odometry (TLIO) achieves low position drift by combining
> raw IMU data with predicted displacements by neural networks, but its high
> computational cost restricts deployment on mobile devices. To overcome this, we
> extend TLIO to bicycle localization and introduce an improved Mixture-of
> Experts (MoE) model that reduces both training and inference costs. Experiments
> show that, compared to the state-of-the-art LLIO framework, our method achieves
> comparable accuracy while reducing parameters by 64.7% and computational cost
> by 81.8%.
