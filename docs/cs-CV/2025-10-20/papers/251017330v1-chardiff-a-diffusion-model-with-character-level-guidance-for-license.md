## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The significance of license plate image restoration goes beyond the
> preprocessing stage of License Plate Recognition (LPR) systems, as it also
> serves various purposes, including increasing evidential value, enhancing the
> clarity of visual interface, and facilitating further utilization of license
> plate images. We propose a novel diffusion-based framework with character-level
> guidance, CharDiff, which effectively restores and recognizes severely degraded
> license plate images captured under realistic conditions. CharDiff leverages
> fine-grained character-level priors extracted through external segmentation and
> Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules tailored for low-quality license
> plate images. For precise and focused guidance, CharDiff incorporates a novel
> Character-guided Attention through Region-wise Masking (CHARM) module, which
> ensures that each character's guidance is restricted to its own region, thereby
> avoiding interference with other regions. In experiments, CharDiff
> significantly outperformed the baseline restoration models in both restoration
> quality and recognition accuracy, achieving a 28% relative reduction in CER on
> the Roboflow-LP dataset, compared to the best-performing baseline model. These
> results indicate that the structured character-guided conditioning effectively
> enhances the robustness of diffusion-based license plate restoration and
> recognition in practical deployment scenarios.
