## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Automating the manipulation of granular materials poses significant
> challenges due to complex contact dynamics, unpredictable material properties,
> and intricate system states. Existing approaches often fail to achieve
> efficiency and accuracy in such tasks. To fill the research gap, this paper
> studies the small-scale and high-precision granular material digging task with
> unknown physical properties. A new framework, named differentiable digging
> robot (DDBot), is proposed to manipulate granular materials, including sand and
> soil.
>   Specifically, we equip DDBot with a differentiable physics-based simulator,
> tailored for granular material manipulation, powered by GPU-accelerated
> parallel computing and automatic differentiation. DDBot can perform efficient
> differentiable system identification and high-precision digging skill
> optimisation for unknown granular materials, which is enabled by a
> differentiable skill-to-action mapping, a task-oriented demonstration method,
> gradient clipping and line search-based gradient descent.
>   Experimental results show that DDBot can efficiently (converge within 5 to 20
> minutes) identify unknown granular material dynamics and optimise digging
> skills, with high-precision results in zero-shot real-world deployments,
> highlighting its practicality. Benchmark results against state-of-the-art
> baselines also confirm the robustness and efficiency of DDBot in such digging
> tasks.
