## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Finding near-optimal solutions for dense multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF)
> problems in real-time remains challenging even for state-of-the-art planners.
> To this end, we develop a hybrid framework that integrates a learned heuristic
> derived from MAGAT, a neural MAPF policy with a graph attention scheme, into a
> leading search-based algorithm, LaCAM. While prior work has explored
> learning-guided search in MAPF, such methods have historically underperformed.
> In contrast, our approach, termed LaGAT, outperforms both purely search-based
> and purely learning-based methods in dense scenarios. This is achieved through
> an enhanced MAGAT architecture, a pre-train-then-fine-tune strategy on maps of
> interest, and a deadlock detection scheme to account for imperfect neural
> guidance. Our results demonstrate that, when carefully designed, hybrid search
> offers a powerful solution for tightly coupled, challenging multi-agent
> coordination problems.
