## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Safe and efficient robotic navigation among humans is essential for
> integrating robots into everyday environments. Most existing approaches focus
> on simplified 2D crowd navigation and fail to account for the full complexity
> of human body dynamics beyond root motion. We present HumanMPC, a Model
> Predictive Control (MPC) framework for 3D Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) navigation
> among humans that combines theoretical safety guarantees with data-driven
> models for realistic human motion forecasting. Our approach introduces a novel
> twist to reachability-based safety formulation that constrains only the initial
> control input for safety while modeling its effects over the entire planning
> horizon, enabling safe yet efficient navigation. We validate HumanMPC in both
> simulated experiments using real human trajectories and in the real-world,
> demonstrating its effectiveness across tasks ranging from goal-directed
> navigation to visual servoing for human tracking. While we apply our method to
> MAVs in this work, it is generic and can be adapted by other platforms. Our
> results show that the method ensures safety without excessive conservatism and
> outperforms baseline approaches in both efficiency and reliability.
