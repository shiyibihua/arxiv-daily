## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Accurate segmentation and classification of white blood cells (WBCs) in
> microscopic images are essential for diagnosis and monitoring of many
> hematological disorders, yet remain challenging due to staining variability,
> complex backgrounds, and class imbalance. In this paper, we introduce a novel
> Saliency-Guided Cross-Layer Deep Feature Fusion framework (SG-CLDFF) that
> tightly integrates saliency-driven preprocessing with multi-scale deep feature
> aggregation to improve both robustness and interpretability for WBC analysis.
> SG-CLDFF first computes saliency priors to highlight candidate WBC regions and
> guide subsequent feature extraction. A lightweight hybrid backbone
> (EfficientSwin-style) produces multi-resolution representations, which are
> fused by a ResNeXt-CC-inspired cross-layer fusion module to preserve
> complementary information from shallow and deep layers. The network is trained
> in a multi-task setup with concurrent segmentation and cell-type classification
> heads, using class-aware weighted losses and saliency-alignment regularization
> to mitigate imbalance and suppress background activation. Interpretability is
> enforced through Grad-CAM visualizations and saliency consistency checks,
> allowing model decisions to be inspected at the regional level. We validate the
> framework on standard public benchmarks (BCCD, LISC, ALL-IDB), reporting
> consistent gains in IoU, F1, and classification accuracy compared to strong CNN
> and transformer baselines. An ablation study also demonstrates the individual
> contributions of saliency preprocessing and cross-layer fusion. SG-CLDFF offers
> a practical and explainable path toward more reliable automated WBC analysis in
> clinical workflows.
