## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models extend vision-language models to embodied
> control by mapping natural-language instructions and visual observations to
> robot actions. Despite their capabilities, VLA systems face significant
> challenges due to their massive computational and memory demands, which
> conflict with the constraints of edge platforms such as on-board mobile
> manipulators that require real-time performance. Addressing this tension has
> become a central focus of recent research. In light of the growing efforts
> toward more efficient and scalable VLA systems, this survey provides a
> systematic review of approaches for improving VLA efficiency, with an emphasis
> on reducing latency, memory footprint, and training and inference costs. We
> categorize existing solutions into four dimensions: model architecture,
> perception feature, action generation, and training/inference strategies,
> summarizing representative techniques within each category. Finally, we discuss
> future trends and open challenges, highlighting directions for advancing
> efficient embodied intelligence.
