## 📄 摘要（原文）

> With the development of underwater exploration and marine protection,
> underwater vision tasks are widespread. Due to the degraded underwater
> environment, characterized by color distortion, low contrast, and blurring,
> camouflaged instance segmentation (CIS) faces greater challenges in accurately
> segmenting objects that blend closely with their surroundings. Traditional
> camouflaged instance segmentation methods, trained on terrestrial-dominated
> datasets with limited underwater samples, may exhibit inadequate performance in
> underwater scenes. To address these issues, we introduce the first underwater
> camouflaged instance segmentation (UCIS) dataset, abbreviated as UCIS4K, which
> comprises 3,953 images of camouflaged marine organisms with instance-level
> annotations. In addition, we propose an Underwater Camouflaged Instance
> Segmentation network based on Segment Anything Model (UCIS-SAM). Our UCIS-SAM
> includes three key modules. First, the Channel Balance Optimization Module
> (CBOM) enhances channel characteristics to improve underwater feature learning,
> effectively addressing the model's limited understanding of underwater
> environments. Second, the Frequency Domain True Integration Module (FDTIM) is
> proposed to emphasize intrinsic object features and reduce interference from
> camouflage patterns, enhancing the segmentation performance of camouflaged
> objects blending with their surroundings. Finally, the Multi-scale Feature
> Frequency Aggregation Module (MFFAM) is designed to strengthen the boundaries
> of low-contrast camouflaged instances across multiple frequency bands,
> improving the model's ability to achieve more precise segmentation of
> camouflaged objects. Extensive experiments on the proposed UCIS4K and public
> benchmarks show that our UCIS-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.
