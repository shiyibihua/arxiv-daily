## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Generating editable, parametric CAD models from a single image holds great
> potential to lower the barriers of industrial concept design. However, current
> multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with accurately
> inferring 3D geometry from 2D images due to limited spatial reasoning
> capabilities. We address this limitation by introducing GACO-CAD, a novel
> two-stage post-training framework. It is designed to achieve a joint objective:
> simultaneously improving the geometric accuracy of the generated CAD models and
> encouraging the use of more concise modeling procedures. First, during
> supervised fine-tuning, we leverage depth and surface normal maps as dense
> geometric priors, combining them with the RGB image to form a multi-channel
> input. In the context of single-view reconstruction, these priors provide
> complementary spatial cues that help the MLLM more reliably recover 3D geometry
> from 2D observations. Second, during reinforcement learning, we introduce a
> group length reward that, while preserving high geometric fidelity, promotes
> the generation of more compact and less redundant parametric modeling
> sequences. A simple dynamic weighting strategy is adopted to stabilize
> training. Experiments on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that GACO-CAD
> achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same MLLM backbone,
> consistently outperforming existing methods in terms of code validity,
> geometric accuracy, and modeling conciseness.
