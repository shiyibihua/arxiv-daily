## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper addresses the problem of planning complex manipulation tasks, in
> which multiple robots with different end-effectors and capabilities, informed
> by computer vision, must plan and execute concatenated sequences of actions on
> a variety of objects that can appear in arbitrary positions and configurations
> in unstructured scenes. We propose an intent-driven planning pipeline which can
> robustly construct such action sequences with varying degrees of supervisory
> input from a human using simple language instructions. The pipeline integrates:
> (i) perception-to-text scene encoding, (ii) an ensemble of large language
> models (LLMs) that generate candidate removal sequences based on the operator's
> intent, (iii) an LLM-based verifier that enforces formatting and precedence
> constraints, and (iv) a deterministic consistency filter that rejects
> hallucinated objects. The pipeline is evaluated on an example task in which two
> robot arms work collaboratively to dismantle an Electric Vehicle battery for
> recycling applications. A variety of components must be grasped and removed in
> specific sequences, determined by human instructions and/or by task-order
> feasibility decisions made by the autonomous system. On 200 real scenes with
> 600 operator prompts across five component classes, we used metrics of
> full-sequence correctness and next-task correctness to evaluate and compare
> five LLM-based planners (including ablation analyses of pipeline components).
> We also evaluated the LLM-based human interface in terms of time to execution
> and NASA TLX with human participant experiments. Results indicate that our
> ensemble-with-verification approach reliably maps operator intent to safe,
> executable multi-robot plans while maintaining low user effort.
