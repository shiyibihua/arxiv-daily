## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The advancement of UAV technology has enabled efficient, non-contact
> structural health monitoring. Combined with photogrammetry, UAVs can capture
> high-resolution scans and reconstruct detailed 3D models of infrastructure.
> However, a key challenge remains in segmenting specific structural components
> from these models-a process traditionally reliant on time-consuming and
> error-prone manual labeling. To address this issue, we propose a machine
> learning-based framework for automated segmentation of 3D point clouds. Our
> approach uses the complementary strengths of real-world UAV-scanned point
> clouds and synthetic data generated from Building Information Modeling (BIM) to
> overcome the limitations associated with manual labeling. Validation on a
> railroad track dataset demonstrated high accuracy in identifying and segmenting
> major components such as rails and crossties. Moreover, by using smaller-scale
> datasets supplemented with BIM data, the framework significantly reduced
> training time while maintaining reasonable segmentation accuracy. This
> automated approach improves the precision and efficiency of 3D infrastructure
> model segmentation and advances the integration of UAV and BIM technologies in
> structural health monitoring and infrastructure management.
