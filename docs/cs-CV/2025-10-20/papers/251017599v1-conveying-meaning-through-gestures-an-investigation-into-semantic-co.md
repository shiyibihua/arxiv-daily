## 💡 一句话要点

**比较AQ-GT与AQ-GT-a框架，评估语义增强在共语手势生成中的效果与感知。**

**关键词**: `共语手势生成` `语义增强` `概念传达` `人类感知评估` `泛化能力`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：语义增强能否提升共语手势生成的概念传达与人类感知。
2. 方法要点：使用AQ-GT及其语义增强变体AQ-GT-a生成手势，并基于SAGA语料进行实验。
3. 实验或效果：AQ-GT在训练域内概念传达更优，AQ-GT-a在形状大小表示上泛化更好。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This study explores two frameworks for co-speech gesture generation, AQ-GT
> and its semantically-augmented variant AQ-GT-a, to evaluate their ability to
> convey meaning through gestures and how humans perceive the resulting
> movements. Using sentences from the SAGA spatial communication corpus,
> contextually similar sentences, and novel movement-focused sentences, we
> conducted a user-centered evaluation of concept recognition and human-likeness.
> Results revealed a nuanced relationship between semantic annotations and
> performance. The original AQ-GT framework, lacking explicit semantic input, was
> surprisingly more effective at conveying concepts within its training domain.
> Conversely, the AQ-GT-a framework demonstrated better generalization,
> particularly for representing shape and size in novel contexts. While
> participants rated gestures from AQ-GT-a as more expressive and helpful, they
> did not perceive them as more human-like. These findings suggest that explicit
> semantic enrichment does not guarantee improved gesture generation and that its
> effectiveness is highly dependent on the context, indicating a potential
> trade-off between specialization and generalization.
