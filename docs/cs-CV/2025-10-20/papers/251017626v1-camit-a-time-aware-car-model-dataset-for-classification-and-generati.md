## 📄 摘要（原文）

> AI systems must adapt to evolving visual environments, especially in domains
> where object appearances change over time. We introduce Car Models in Time
> (CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models,
> a representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled
> samples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023),
> supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on
> in-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist
> models while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models
> are tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental
> classification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging,
> evolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies:
> time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental
> classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving
> temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that
> leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs.
> CaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained
> visual recognition and generation.
