**关键词**: `机器人操作` `数据增强` `视觉-语言-动作模型` `离线强化学习` `分布外状态` `探索性采样`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：模仿学习数据集缺乏失败和恢复数据，导致模型在分布外状态表现不佳。
2. 方法要点：利用离线强化学习识别次优动作，并通过探索性采样自动扩充OOD数据。
3. 实验或效果：在LIBERO基准和真实任务中验证，提升模型稳定性和泛化能力。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
> on complex robotic manipulation tasks through imitation learning. However,
> existing imitation learning datasets contain only successful trajectories and
> lack failure or recovery data, especially for out-of-distribution (OOD) states
> where the robot deviates from the main policy due to minor perturbations or
> errors, leading VLA models to struggle with states deviating from the training
> distribution. To this end, we propose an automated OOD data augmentation
> framework named RESample through exploratory sampling. Specifically, we first
> leverage offline reinforcement learning to obtain an action-value network that
> accurately identifies sub-optimal actions under the current manipulation
> policy. We further sample potential OOD states from trajectories via rollout,
> and design an exploratory sampling mechanism that adaptively incorporates these
> action proxies into the training dataset to ensure efficiency. Subsequently,
> our framework explicitly encourages the VLAs to recover from OOD states and
> enhances their robustness against distributional shifts. We conduct extensive
> experiments on the LIBERO benchmark as well as real-world robotic manipulation
> tasks, demonstrating that RESample consistently improves the stability and
> generalization ability of VLA models.
