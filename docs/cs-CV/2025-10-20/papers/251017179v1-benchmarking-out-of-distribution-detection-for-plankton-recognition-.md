## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Automated plankton recognition models face significant challenges during
> real-world deployment due to distribution shifts (Out-of-Distribution, OoD)
> between training and test data. This stems from plankton's complex
> morphologies, vast species diversity, and the continuous discovery of novel
> species, which leads to unpredictable errors during inference. Despite rapid
> advancements in OoD detection methods in recent years, the field of plankton
> recognition still lacks a systematic integration of the latest computer vision
> developments and a unified benchmark for large-scale evaluation. To address
> this, this paper meticulously designed a series of OoD benchmarks simulating
> various distribution shift scenarios based on the DYB-PlanktonNet dataset
> \cite{875n-f104-21}, and systematically evaluated twenty-two OoD detection
> methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ViM
> \cite{wang2022vim} method significantly outperforms other approaches in our
> constructed benchmarks, particularly excelling in Far-OoD scenarios with
> substantial improvements in key metrics. This comprehensive evaluation not only
> provides a reliable reference for algorithm selection in automated plankton
> recognition but also lays a solid foundation for future research in plankton
> OoD detection. To our knowledge, this study marks the first large-scale,
> systematic evaluation and analysis of Out-of-Distribution data detection
> methods in plankton recognition. Code is available at
