## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Road crack detection is essential for intelligent infrastructure maintenance
> in smart cities. To reduce reliance on costly pixel-level annotations, we
> propose WP-CrackNet, an end-to-end weakly-supervised method that trains with
> only image-level labels for pixel-wise crack detection. WP-CrackNet integrates
> three components: a classifier generating class activation maps (CAMs), a
> reconstructor measuring feature inferability, and a detector producing
> pixel-wise road crack detection results. During training, the classifier and
> reconstructor alternate in adversarial learning to encourage crack CAMs to
> cover complete crack regions, while the detector learns from pseudo labels
> derived from post-processed crack CAMs. This mutual feedback among the three
> components improves learning stability and detection accuracy. To further boost
> detection performance, we design a path-aware attention module (PAAM) that
> fuses high-level semantics from the classifier with low-level structural cues
> from the reconstructor by modeling spatial and channel-wise dependencies.
> Additionally, a center-enhanced CAM consistency module (CECCM) is proposed to
> refine crack CAMs using center Gaussian weighting and consistency constraints,
> enabling better pseudo-label generation. We create three image-level datasets
> and extensive experiments show that WP-CrackNet achieves comparable results to
> supervised methods and outperforms existing weakly-supervised methods,
> significantly advancing scalable road inspection. The source code package and
> datasets are available at https://mias.group/WP-CrackNet/.
