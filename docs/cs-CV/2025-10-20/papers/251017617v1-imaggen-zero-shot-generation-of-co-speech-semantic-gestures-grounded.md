## 💡 一句话要点

**提出ImaGGen系统，通过语言和图像输入零样本生成语义手势以增强人机交互。**

**关键词**: `手势生成` `零样本学习` `语义匹配` `逆运动学` `多模态交互` `虚拟代理`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有手势生成方法仅产生节拍手势，缺乏语义连贯性。
2. 方法要点：结合图像分析提取物体属性，语义匹配链接视觉与语言，逆运动学合成手势。
3. 实验或效果：用户研究表明，生成手势在模糊语音场景中显著提升物体属性识别能力。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Human communication combines speech with expressive nonverbal cues such as
> hand gestures that serve manifold communicative functions. Yet, current
> generative gesture generation approaches are restricted to simple, repetitive
> beat gestures that accompany the rhythm of speaking but do not contribute to
> communicating semantic meaning. This paper tackles a core challenge in
> co-speech gesture synthesis: generating iconic or deictic gestures that are
> semantically coherent with a verbal utterance. Such gestures cannot be derived
> from language input alone, which inherently lacks the visual meaning that is
> often carried autonomously by gestures. We therefore introduce a zero-shot
> system that generates gestures from a given language input and additionally is
> informed by imagistic input, without manual annotation or human intervention.
> Our method integrates an image analysis pipeline that extracts key object
> properties such as shape, symmetry, and alignment, together with a semantic
> matching module that links these visual details to spoken text. An inverse
> kinematics engine then synthesizes iconic and deictic gestures and combines
> them with co-generated natural beat gestures for coherent multimodal
> communication. A comprehensive user study demonstrates the effectiveness of our
> approach. In scenarios where speech alone was ambiguous, gestures generated by
> our system significantly improved participants' ability to identify object
> properties, confirming their interpretability and communicative value. While
> challenges remain in representing complex shapes, our results highlight the
> importance of context-aware semantic gestures for creating expressive and
> collaborative virtual agents or avatars, marking a substantial step forward
> towards efficient and robust, embodied human-agent interaction. More
