## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Medical image enhancement is crucial for improving the quality and
> interpretability of diagnostic images, ultimately supporting early detection,
> accurate diagnosis, and effective treatment planning. Despite advancements in
> imaging technologies such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound, medical images
> often suffer from challenges like noise, artifacts, and low contrast, which
> limit their diagnostic potential. Addressing these challenges requires robust
> preprocessing, denoising algorithms, and advanced enhancement methods, with
> deep learning techniques playing an increasingly significant role. This
> systematic literature review, following the PRISMA approach, investigates the
> key challenges, recent advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image
> enhancement. By analyzing findings from 39 peer-reviewed studies, this review
> provides insights into the effectiveness of various enhancement methods across
> different imaging modalities and the importance of evaluation metrics in
> assessing their impact. Key issues like low contrast and noise are identified
> as the most frequent, with MRI and multi-modal imaging receiving the most
> attention, while specialized modalities such as histopathology, endoscopy, and
> bone scintigraphy remain underexplored. Out of the 39 studies, 29 utilize
> conventional mathematical methods, 9 focus on deep learning techniques, and 1
> explores a hybrid approach. In terms of image quality assessment, 18 studies
> employ both reference-based and non-reference-based metrics, 9 rely solely on
> reference-based metrics, and 12 use only non-reference-based metrics, with a
> total of 65 IQA metrics introduced, predominantly non-reference-based. This
> review highlights current limitations, research gaps, and potential future
> directions for advancing medical image enhancement.
