## 💡 一句话要点

**提出UrbanFusion模型，通过随机多模态融合学习稳健空间表示以预测城市现象**

**关键词**: `空间表示学习` `多模态融合` `地理人工智能` `城市预测` `Transformer模型`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有空间基础模型模态有限且缺乏多模态融合能力，难以整合地理数据预测城市现象
2. 方法要点：使用模态特定编码器和Transformer融合模块，集成街景、遥感等多模态输入
3. 实验或效果：在41个任务和56个城市评估中，优于先进模型，泛化能力强且支持灵活模态输入

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Forecasting urban phenomena such as housing prices and public health
> indicators requires the effective integration of various geospatial data.
> Current methods primarily utilize task-specific models, while recent foundation
> models for spatial representations often support only limited modalities and
> lack multimodal fusion capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we present
> UrbanFusion, a Geo-Foundation Model (GeoFM) that features Stochastic Multimodal
> Fusion (SMF). The framework employs modality-specific encoders to process
> different types of inputs, including street view imagery, remote sensing data,
> cartographic maps, and points of interest (POIs) data. These multimodal inputs
> are integrated via a Transformer-based fusion module that learns unified
> representations. An extensive evaluation across 41 tasks in 56 cities worldwide
> demonstrates UrbanFusion's strong generalization and predictive performance
> compared to state-of-the-art GeoAI models. Specifically, it 1) outperforms
> prior foundation models on location-encoding, 2) allows multimodal input during
> inference, and 3) generalizes well to regions unseen during training.
> UrbanFusion can flexibly utilize any subset of available modalities for a given
> location during both pretraining and inference, enabling broad applicability
> across diverse data availability scenarios. All source code is available at
