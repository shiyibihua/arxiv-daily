## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Dynamic scene rendering and reconstruction play a crucial role in computer
> vision and augmented reality. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting
> (3DGS), have enabled accurate modeling of dynamic urban scenes, but for urban
> scenes they require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations
> and motion data in the form of tracklets or pre-defined object templates such
> as SMPL. In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic
> priors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance
> function (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of
> these requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance
> Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust
> object representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified
> optimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting
> and improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable
> and precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
> state-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on
> urban scenes. When incorporating LiDAR, our approach improved further in
> reconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories,
> without ground-truth 3D motion annotation. Additionally, our method enables
> various scene editing tasks, including scene decomposition, and scene
> composition.
