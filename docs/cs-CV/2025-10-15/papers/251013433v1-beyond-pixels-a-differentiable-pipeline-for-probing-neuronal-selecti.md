## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Visual perception relies on inference of 3D scene properties such as shape,
> pose, and lighting. To understand how visual sensory neurons enable robust
> perception, it is crucial to characterize their selectivity to such physically
> interpretable factors. However, current approaches mainly operate on 2D pixels,
> making it difficult to isolate selectivity for physical scene properties. To
> address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable rendering pipeline that
> optimizes deformable meshes to obtain MEIs directly in 3D. The method
> parameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets
> and scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric
> regularity. Applied to models of monkey area V4, our approach enables probing
> neuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors such as pose and lighting.
> This approach bridges inverse graphics with systems neuroscience, offering a
> way to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli beyond
> conventional pixel-based methods.
