## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful
> paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked
> modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models
> suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack
> of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation
> across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this
> work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues
> by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next
> frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides
> global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame
> synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance
> that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ
> noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR
> and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality
> videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable
> performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals
> diffusion-based methods.
