## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin
> designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and
> unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection
> and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process.
> This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a
> comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating
> visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs
> consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap
> from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two
> automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train
> OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for
> universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3).
> Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification
> and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We
> propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that
> leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within
> unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through
> iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal
> verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios.
> Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7),
> and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods,
> such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual
> verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation
> and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and
> controllable next-generation reasoning systems.
