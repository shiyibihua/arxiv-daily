## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Our daily life is highly influenced by what we consume and see. Attracting
> and holding one's attention -- the definition of (visual) interestingness -- is
> essential. The rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) trained on large-scale
> visual and textual data has demonstrated impressive capabilities. We explore
> these models' potential to understand to what extent the concepts of visual
> interestingness are captured and examine the alignment between human
> assessments and GPT-4o's, a leading LMM, predictions through comparative
> analysis. Our studies reveal partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o. It
> already captures the concept as best compared to state-of-the-art methods.
> Hence, this allows for the effective labeling of image pairs according to their
> (commonly) interestingness, which are used as training data to distill the
> knowledge into a learning-to-rank model. The insights pave the way for a deeper
> understanding of human interest.
