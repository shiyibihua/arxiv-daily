## 💡 一句话要点

**提出Paper Copilot系统以解决AI会议同行评审的透明度和可追溯性问题**

**关键词**: `同行评审系统` `数字档案` `开放数据集` `实证分析` `评审演变` `AI会议`

## 📋 核心要点

1. AI会议同行评审面临评审员负担重、标准不一致和透明度低等核心问题
2. 构建持久数字档案和开放数据集，支持大规模研究评审演变
3. 对ICLR多年评审进行实证分析，促进可复现研究和系统改进

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The rapid growth of AI conferences is straining an already fragile
> peer-review system, leading to heavy reviewer workloads, expertise mismatches,
> inconsistent evaluation standards, superficial or templated reviews, and
> limited accountability under compressed timelines. In response, conference
> organizers have introduced new policies and interventions to preserve review
> standards. Yet these ad-hoc changes often create further concerns and confusion
> about the review process, leaving how papers are ultimately accepted - and how
> practices evolve across years - largely opaque. We present Paper Copilot, a
> system that creates durable digital archives of peer reviews across a wide
> range of computer-science venues, an open dataset that enables researchers to
> study peer review at scale, and a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR
> reviews spanning multiple years. By releasing both the infrastructure and the
> dataset, Paper Copilot supports reproducible research on the evolution of peer
> review. We hope these resources help the community track changes, diagnose
> failure modes, and inform evidence-based improvements toward a more robust,
> transparent, and reliable peer-review system.
