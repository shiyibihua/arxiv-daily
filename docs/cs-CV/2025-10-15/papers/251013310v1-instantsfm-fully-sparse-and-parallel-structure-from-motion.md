## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a method that recovers camera poses and scene
> geometry from uncalibrated images, is a central component in robotic
> reconstruction and simulation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of
> traditional SfM methods such as COLMAP and its follow-up work, GLOMAP, naive
> CPU-specialized implementations of bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning
> (GP) introduce significant computational overhead when handling large-scale
> scenarios, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and speed in SfM. Moreover,
> the blessing of efficient C++-based implementations in COLMAP and GLOMAP comes
> with the curse of limited flexibility, as they lack support for various
> external optimization options. On the other hand, while deep learning based SfM
> pipelines like VGGSfM and VGGT enable feed-forward 3D reconstruction, they are
> unable to scale to thousands of input views at once as GPU memory consumption
> increases sharply as the number of input views grows. In this paper, we unleash
> the full potential of GPU parallel computation to accelerate each critical
> stage of the standard SfM pipeline. Building upon recent advances in
> sparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization, our design extends these
> techniques to accelerate both BA and GP within a unified global SfM framework.
> Through extensive experiments on datasets of varying scales (e.g. 5000 images
> where VGGSfM and VGGT run out of memory), our method demonstrates up to about
> 40 times speedup over COLMAP while achieving consistently comparable or even
> improved reconstruction accuracy. Our project page can be found at
