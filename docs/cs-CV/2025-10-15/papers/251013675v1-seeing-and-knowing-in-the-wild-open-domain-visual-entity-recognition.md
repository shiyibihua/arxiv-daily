## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities
> depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as
> those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed
> label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities
> are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the
> task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity,
> and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a
> Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both
> images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by
> structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs
> to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type
> hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We
> evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual
> recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show
> that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy,
> especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the
> accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite
> being 35 times smaller.
