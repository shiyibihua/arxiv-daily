## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Multi-view generation with camera pose control and prompt-based customization
> are both essential elements for achieving controllable generative models.
> However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization
> with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit
> viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps,
> we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly
> achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity
> of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which
> inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse
> prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based
> framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and
> customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's
> identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the
> text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention,
> which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference
> stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering
> explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent
> completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and
> surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the
> only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and
> customization.
