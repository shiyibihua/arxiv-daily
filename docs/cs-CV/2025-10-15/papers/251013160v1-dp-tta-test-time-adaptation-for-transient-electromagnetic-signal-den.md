## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) method is widely used in various geophysical
> applications, providing valuable insights into subsurface properties. However,
> time-domain TEM signals are often submerged in various types of noise. While
> recent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,
> these models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario
> data, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from
> different geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment
> often struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological
> conditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising
> performance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization
> Test-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess
> intrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,
> which remain consistent across different regions regardless of external
> conditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for
> guiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust
> parameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance
> in new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.
> Specifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic
> characteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the
> model during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to
> adapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses
> derived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order
> variation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
> achieves much better performance than existing TEM denoising methods and TTA
> methods.
