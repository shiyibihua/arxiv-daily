## 💡 一句话要点

**提出模型无关的对抗攻击EDPA与防御策略，提升视觉-语言-动作模型的鲁棒性。**

**关键词**: `对抗攻击` `模型无关防御` `视觉-语言-动作模型` `机器人学习` `语义对齐` `潜表示优化`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：VLA模型在机器人任务中对抗鲁棒性不足，易受攻击导致任务失败。
2. 方法要点：EDPA通过破坏视觉-文本语义对齐和最大化潜表示差异，生成可放置的对抗补丁。
3. 实验或效果：在LIBERO基准上，EDPA显著增加任务失败率，防御策略有效缓解性能下降。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in
> robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from
> natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial
> robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial
> patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first
> introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic
> adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the
> camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to
> different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model
> architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these
> patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual
> latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent
> representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.
> Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's
> interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate
> incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given
> robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for
> the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent
> representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.
> Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation
> benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate
> of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates
> this degradation. The codebase is accessible via the homepage at
> https://edpa-attack.github.io/.
