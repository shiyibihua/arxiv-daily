## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Although digital fabrication processes at the desktop scale have become
> proficient and prolific, systems aimed at producing larger-scale structures are
> still typically complex, expensive, and unreliable. In this work, we present an
> approach for the fabrication of scalable macroscale structures using simple
> robots and interlocking lattice building blocks. A target structure is first
> voxelized so that it can be populated with an architected lattice. These voxels
> are then grouped into larger interconnected blocks, which are produced using
> standard digital fabrication processes, leveraging their capability to produce
> highly complex geometries at a small scale. These blocks, on the size scale of
> tens of centimeters, are then fed to mobile relative robots that are able to
> traverse over the structure and place new blocks to form structures on the
> meter scale. To facilitate the assembly of large structures, we introduce a
> live digital twin simulation tool for controlling and coordinating assembly
> robots that enables both global planning for a target structure and live user
> design, interaction, or intervention. To improve assembly throughput, we
> introduce a new modular assembly robot, designed for hierarchical voxel
> handling. We validate this system by demonstrating the voxelization,
> hierarchical blocking, path planning, and robotic fabrication of a set of
> meter-scale objects.
