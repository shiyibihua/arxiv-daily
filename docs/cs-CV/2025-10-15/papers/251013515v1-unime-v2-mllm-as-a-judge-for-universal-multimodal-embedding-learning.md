## 💡 一句话要点

**提出UniME-V2模型，利用MLLM作为评判者增强多模态嵌入学习，解决语义差异捕捉和负样本多样性问题。**

**关键词**: `多模态嵌入学习` `硬负样本挖掘` `MLLM评判机制` `语义匹配分数` `重排序模型` `检索任务`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 现有方法难以捕捉候选间细微语义差异，且负样本缺乏多样性，导致嵌入判别能力有限。
2. 引入MLLM-as-a-Judge机制，评估查询-候选对语义对齐，生成软匹配分数用于硬负样本挖掘和软标签对齐。
3. 在MMEB基准和多个检索任务上实验，平均性能达到最先进水平。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks.
> Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the
> similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to
> capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in
> negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative
> ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage
> the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation
> learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model.
> Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global
> retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes
> MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate
> soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard
> negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the
> identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the
> semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid
> one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft
> semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among
> candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further
> improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on
> our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization
> approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and
> multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves
> state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.
