## 💡 一句话要点

**提出CIGOcc框架，通过多级表示融合提升自动驾驶中基于相机的3D占用预测性能。**

**关键词**: `3D占用预测` `多级表示融合` `知识蒸馏` `自动驾驶感知` `相机视觉` `特征提取`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有方法未充分利用2D图像中多样特征，导致3D占用预测性能受限。
2. 方法要点：提取分割、图形和深度特征，并采用可变形多级融合机制进行融合。
3. 实验或效果：在SemanticKITTI基准上实现SOTA性能，未增加训练成本。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Camera-based occupancy prediction is a mainstream approach for 3D perception
> in autonomous driving, aiming to infer complete 3D scene geometry and semantics
> from 2D images. Almost existing methods focus on improving performance through
> structural modifications, such as lightweight backbones and complex cascaded
> frameworks, with good yet limited performance. Few studies explore from the
> perspective of representation fusion, leaving the rich diversity of features in
> 2D images underutilized. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{CIGOcc, a
> two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation
> fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from
> an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse
> these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge
> distilled from SAM to further enhance prediction accuracy. Without increasing
> training costs, CIGOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
> SemanticKITTI benchmark. The code is provided in the supplementary material and
> will be released https://github.com/VitaLemonTea1/CIGOcc
