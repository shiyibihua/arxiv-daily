## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables robots and autonomous vehicles to
> identify previously visited locations by matching current observations against
> a database of known places. However, VPR systems face significant challenges
> when deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal
> changes, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as
> loop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
> pipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose
> three training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by
> analyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing
> VPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by
> measuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates
> competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty
> (SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that
> generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data
> to select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional
> model training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive
> geometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art
> VPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at
> discriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently
> outperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational
> overhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied
> environmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.
