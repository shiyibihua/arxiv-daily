## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Properly handling delicate produce with robotic manipulators is a major part
> of the future role of automation in agricultural harvesting and processing.
> Grasping with the correct amount of force is crucial in not only ensuring
> proper grip on the object, but also to avoid damaging or bruising the product.
> In this work, a flexible pressure sensor that is both low cost and easy to
> fabricate is integrated with robotic grippers for working with produce of
> varying shapes, sizes, and stiffnesses. The sensor is successfully integrated
> with both a rigid robotic gripper, as well as a pneumatically actuated soft
> finger. Furthermore, an algorithm is proposed for accelerated estimation of the
> steady-state value of the sensor output based on the transient response data,
> to enable real-time applications. The sensor is shown to be effective in
> incorporating feedback to correctly grasp objects of unknown sizes and
> stiffnesses. At the same time, the sensor provides estimates for these values
> which can be utilized for identification of qualities such as ripeness levels
> and bruising. It is also shown to be able to provide force feedback for objects
> of variable stiffnesses. This enables future use not only for produce
> identification, but also for tasks such as quality control and selective
> distribution based on ripeness levels.
