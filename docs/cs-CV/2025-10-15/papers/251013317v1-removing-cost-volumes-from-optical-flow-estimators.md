## 💡 一句话要点

**提出训练策略以移除光流估计器中的代价体积，提升推理速度与内存效率。**

**关键词**: `光流估计` `代价体积移除` `训练策略` `推理加速` `内存优化`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：代价体积在光流估计中计算和空间复杂度高，限制处理速度和输入分辨率。
2. 方法要点：基于训练后代价体积重要性降低的观察，设计策略在训练中移除代价体积。
3. 实验或效果：模型在保持高精度下，推理速度提升1.2倍，内存占用降低6倍。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Cost volumes are used in every modern optical flow estimator, but due to
> their computational and space complexity, they are often a limiting factor
> regarding both processing speed and the resolution of input frames. Motivated
> by our empirical observation that cost volumes lose their importance once all
> other network parts of, e.g., a RAFT-based pipeline have been sufficiently
> trained, we introduce a training strategy that allows removing the cost volume
> from optical flow estimators throughout training. This leads to significantly
> improved inference speed and reduced memory requirements. Using our training
> strategy, we create three different models covering different compute budgets.
> Our most accurate model reaches state-of-the-art accuracy while being
> $1.2\times$ faster and having a $6\times$ lower memory footprint than
> comparable models; our fastest model is capable of processing Full HD frames at
> $20\,\mathrm{FPS}$ using only $500\,\mathrm{MB}$ of GPU memory.
