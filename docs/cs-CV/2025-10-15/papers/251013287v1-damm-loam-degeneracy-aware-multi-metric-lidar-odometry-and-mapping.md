## 📄 摘要（原文）

> LiDAR Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems are essential for
> enabling precise navigation and environmental reconstruction across various
> applications. Although current point-to-plane ICP algorithms perform effec-
> tively in structured, feature-rich environments, they struggle in scenarios
> with sparse features, repetitive geometric structures, and high-frequency
> motion. This leads to degeneracy in 6- DOF pose estimation. Most
> state-of-the-art algorithms address these challenges by incorporating
> additional sensing modalities, but LiDAR-only solutions continue to face
> limitations under such conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel
> Degeneracy-Aware Multi-Metric LiDAR Odometry and Map- ping (DAMM-LOAM) module.
> Our system improves mapping accuracy through point cloud classification based
> on surface normals and neighborhood analysis. Points are classified into
> ground, walls, roof, edges, and non-planar points, enabling accurate
> correspondences. A Degeneracy-based weighted least squares-based ICP algorithm
> is then applied for accurate odom- etry estimation. Additionally, a Scan
> Context based back-end is implemented to support robust loop closures.
> DAMM-LOAM demonstrates significant improvements in odometry accuracy,
> especially in indoor environments such as long corridors
