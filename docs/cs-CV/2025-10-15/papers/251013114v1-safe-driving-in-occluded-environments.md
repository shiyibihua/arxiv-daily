## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Ensuring safe autonomous driving in the presence of occlusions poses a
> significant challenge in its policy design. While existing model-driven control
> techniques based on set invariance can handle visible risks, occlusions create
> latent risks in which safety-critical states are not observable. Data-driven
> techniques also struggle to handle latent risks because direct mappings from
> risk-critical objects in sensor inputs to safe actions cannot be learned
> without visible risk-critical objects. Motivated by these challenges, in this
> paper, we propose a probabilistic safety certificate for latent risk. Our key
> technical enabler is the application of probabilistic invariance: It relaxes
> the strict observability requirements imposed by set-invariance methods that
> demand the knowledge of risk-critical states. The proposed techniques provide
> linear action constraints that confine the latent risk probability within
> tolerance. Such constraints can be integrated into model predictive controllers
> or embedded in data-driven policies to mitigate latent risks. The proposed
> method is tested using the CARLA simulator and compared with a few existing
> techniques. The theoretical and empirical analysis jointly demonstrate that the
> proposed methods assure long-term safety in real-time control in occluded
> environments without being overly conservative and with transparency to exposed
> risks.
