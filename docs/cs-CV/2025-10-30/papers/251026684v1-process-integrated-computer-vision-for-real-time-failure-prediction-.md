## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We present a long-term deployment study of a machine vision-based anomaly
> detection system for failure prediction in a steel rolling mill. The system
> integrates industrial cameras to monitor equipment operation, alignment, and
> hot bar motion in real time along the process line. Live video streams are
> processed on a centralized video server using deep learning models, enabling
> early prediction of equipment failures and process interruptions, thereby
> reducing unplanned breakdown costs. Server-based inference minimizes the
> computational load on industrial process control systems (PLCs), supporting
> scalable deployment across production lines with minimal additional resources.
> By jointly analyzing sensor data from data acquisition systems and visual
> inputs, the system identifies the location and probable root causes of
> failures, providing actionable insights for proactive maintenance. This
> integrated approach enhances operational reliability, productivity, and
> profitability in industrial manufacturing environments.
