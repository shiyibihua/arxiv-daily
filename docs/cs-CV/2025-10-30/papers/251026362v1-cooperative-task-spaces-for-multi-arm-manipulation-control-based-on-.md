## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Many tasks in human environments require collaborative behavior between
> multiple kinematic chains, either to provide additional support for carrying
> big and bulky objects or to enable the dexterity that is required for in-hand
> manipulation. Since these complex systems often have a very high number of
> degrees of freedom coordinating their movements is notoriously difficult to
> model. In this article, we present the derivation of the theoretical
> foundations for cooperative task spaces of multi-arm robotic systems based on
> geometric primitives defined using conformal geometric algebra. Based on the
> similarity transformations of these cooperative geometric primitives, we derive
> an abstraction of complex robotic systems that enables representing these
> systems in a way that directly corresponds to single-arm systems. By deriving
> the associated analytic and geometric Jacobian matrices, we then show the
> straightforward integration of our approach into classical control techniques
> rooted in operational space control. We demonstrate this using bimanual
> manipulators, humanoids and multi-fingered hands in optimal control experiments
> for reaching desired geometric primitives and in teleoperation experiments
> using differential kinematics control. We then discuss how the geometric
> primitives naturally embed nullspace structures into the controllers that can
> be exploited for introducing secondary control objectives. This work,
> represents the theoretical foundations of this cooperative manipulation control
> framework, and thus the experiments are presented in an abstract way, while
> giving pointers towards potential future applications.
