## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
> estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
> bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
> unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
> without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
> Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
> strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
> and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
> into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
> differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
> using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
> photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
> errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
> and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
> evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
> outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
> surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.
