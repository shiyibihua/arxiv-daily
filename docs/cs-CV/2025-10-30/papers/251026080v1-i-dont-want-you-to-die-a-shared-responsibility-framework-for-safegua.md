## 💡 一句话要点

**提出共享责任框架以减轻儿童-机器人陪伴终止的情感伤害**

**关键词**: `儿童-机器人陪伴` `共享责任框架` `情感伤害` `定性调查` `机器人伦理` `服务终止`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：社交机器人服务终止导致儿童情感纽带断裂，引发责任归属争议。
2. 方法要点：基于Moxie案例，通过定性调查分析参与者对责任分配的认知。
3. 实验或效果：调查显示责任被视为多方共享，并受政治意识形态和父母状态影响。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Social robots like Moxie are designed to form strong emotional bonds with
> children, but their abrupt discontinuation can cause significant struggles and
> distress to children. When these services end, the resulting harm raises
> complex questions of who bears responsibility when children's emotional bonds
> are broken. Using the Moxie shutdown as a case study through a qualitative
> survey of 72 U.S. participants, our findings show that the responsibility is
> viewed as a shared duty across the robot company, parents, developers, and
> government. However, these attributions varied by political ideology and
> parental status of whether they have children. Participants' perceptions of
> whether the robot service should continue are highly polarized; supporters
> propose technical, financial, and governmental pathways for continuity, while
> opponents cite business realities and risks of unhealthy emotional dependency.
> Ultimately, this research contributes an empirically grounded shared
> responsibility framework for safeguarding child-robot companionship by
> detailing how accountability is distributed and contested, informing concrete
> design and policy implications to mitigate the emotional harm of robot
> discontinuation.
