## 💡 一句话要点

**提出强化学习代理以提升F1TENTH赛车在真实世界中的超车性能**

**关键词**: `强化学习` `自主赛车` `超车行为` `F1TENTH平台` `轮对轮竞赛`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：自主轮对轮赛车中超车行为在真实场景中安全性和可靠性不足
2. 方法要点：开发基于强化学习的代理，学习可靠导航和超车策略
3. 实验或效果：在真实F1TENTH车辆上测试，超车率达87%，优于仅训练赛车的56%

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> While autonomous racing performance in Time-Trial scenarios has seen
> significant progress and development, autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing and
> overtaking are still severely limited. These limitations are particularly
> apparent in real-life driving scenarios where state-of-the-art algorithms
> struggle to safely or reliably complete overtaking manoeuvres. This is
> important, as reliable navigation around other vehicles is vital for safe
> autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing. The F1Tenth Competition provides a useful
> opportunity for developing wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms on a standardised
> physical platform. The competition format makes it possible to evaluate
> overtaking and wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms against the state-of-the-art.
> This research presents a novel racing and overtaking agent capable of learning
> to reliably navigate a track and overtake opponents in both simulation and
> reality. The agent was deployed on an F1Tenth vehicle and competed against
> opponents running varying competitive algorithms in the real world. The results
> demonstrate that the agent's training against opponents enables deliberate
> overtaking behaviours with an overtaking rate of 87% compared 56% for an agent
> trained just to race.
