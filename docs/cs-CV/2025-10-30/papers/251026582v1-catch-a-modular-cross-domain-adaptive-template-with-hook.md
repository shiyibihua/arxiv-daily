## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
> impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
> leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
> their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
> scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
> large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
> mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
> bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
> diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
> cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
> requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
> decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
> modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
> adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
> Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
> injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
> model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
> demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
> retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
> MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
> provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
> practical deployment across diverse application domains.
