## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal
> performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur
> in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the
> sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the
> supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential
> element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in
> the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed
> to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to
> propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric
> network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This
> network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to
> derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the
> proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The
> SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction
> of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The
> product classification and edge classification are performed using the
> SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An
> average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk
> management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for
> sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4
> product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%
> is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an
> average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the
> state-of-the-art approaches.
