## 💡 一句话要点

**利用大规模人脸数据集通过眼部裁剪进行深度眼周识别**

**关键词**: `眼周识别` `卷积神经网络` `大规模数据集` `生物识别` `图像裁剪` `性能评估`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：眼周生物识别在非受控条件下性能受限，现有方法依赖小规模数据集。
2. 方法要点：从VGGFace2提取190万眼部图像，训练三种CNN架构评估识别效果。
3. 实验效果：在UFPR-Periocular上EER达1-2%，优于VGGFace2-Pose的9-15%。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We focus on ocular biometrics, specifically the periocular region (the area
> around the eye), which offers high discrimination and minimal acquisition
> constraints. We evaluate three Convolutional Neural Network architectures of
> varying depth and complexity to assess their effectiveness for periocular
> recognition. The networks are trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops extracted from
> the large-scale VGGFace2 database. This significantly contrasts with existing
> works, which typically rely on small-scale periocular datasets for training
> having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images
> from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images,
> and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile
> devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of
> VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from
> 9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In
> contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of
> 1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition
> protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on
> the UFPR dataset to date.
