## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Stochastic state estimation methods for continuum robots (CRs) often struggle
> to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. While several recent works
> have explored sliding-window formulations for CRs, these methods are limited to
> simplified, discrete-time approximations and do not provide stochastic
> representations. In contrast, current stochastic filter methods must run at the
> speed of measurements, limiting their full potential. Recent works in
> continuous-time estimation techniques for CRs show a principled approach to
> addressing this runtime constraint, but are currently restricted to offline
> operation. In this work, we present a sliding-window filter (SWF) for
> continuous-time state estimation of CRs that improves upon the accuracy of a
> filter approach while enabling continuous-time methods to operate online, all
> while running at faster-than-real-time speeds. This represents the first
> stochastic SWF specifically designed for CRs, providing a promising direction
> for future research in this area.
