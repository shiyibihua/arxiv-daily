## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Conventional robots possess a limited understanding of their kinematics and
> are confined to preprogrammed tasks, hindering their ability to leverage tools
> efficiently. Driven by the essential components of tool usage - grasping the
> desired outcome, selecting the most suitable tool, determining optimal tool
> orientation, and executing precise manipulations - we introduce a pioneering
> framework. Our novel approach expands the capabilities of the robot's inverse
> kinematics solver, empowering it to acquire a sequential repertoire of actions
> using tools of varying lengths. By integrating a simulation-learned action
> trajectory with the tool, we showcase the practicality of transferring acquired
> skills from simulation to real-world scenarios through comprehensive
> experimentation. Remarkably, our extended inverse kinematics solver
> demonstrates an impressive error rate of less than 1 cm. Furthermore, our
> trained policy achieves a mean error of 8 cm in simulation. Noteworthy, our
> model achieves virtually indistinguishable performance when employing two
> distinct tools of different lengths. This research provides an indication of
> potential advances in the exploration of all four fundamental aspects of tool
> usage, enabling robots to master the intricate art of tool manipulation across
> diverse tasks.
