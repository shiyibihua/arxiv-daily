## 💡 一句话要点

**提出CRAG-MM基准以评估可穿戴场景下的多模态多轮RAG系统**

**关键词**: `多模态检索增强生成` `可穿戴设备基准` `多轮对话评估` `图像知识图谱检索` `真实世界场景模拟`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：缺乏针对可穿戴设备的多模态多轮检索增强生成综合基准
2. 方法要点：构建包含6.5K三元组和2K多轮对话的数据集，覆盖13个领域
3. 实验或效果：基线方法真实度仅32-43%，显示改进空间，已用于KDD Cup 2025

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
> interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
> entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
> plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
> comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
> scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
> benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
> set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
> conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
> mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
> reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
> image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
> information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
> single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
> conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
> both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
> straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
> single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
> solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
> improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
> participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
> performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.
