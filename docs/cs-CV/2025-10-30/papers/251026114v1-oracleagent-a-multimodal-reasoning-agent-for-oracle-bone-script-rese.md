## 📄 摘要（原文）

> As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
> the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
> current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
> involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
> and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
> critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
> compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
> present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
> management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
> integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
> (LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
> construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
> which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
> cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
> single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
> leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
> retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
> Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
> performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
> surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
> GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
> effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
> research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
> practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
> systems.
