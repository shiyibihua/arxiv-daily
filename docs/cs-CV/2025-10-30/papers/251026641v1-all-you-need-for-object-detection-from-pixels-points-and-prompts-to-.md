## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
> through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
> systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
> detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
> Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
> progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains
> fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative
> intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
> analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
> Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
> rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
> reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
> and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
> capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
> potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
> frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
> moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
> and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
> cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
> cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
> hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
> approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
> Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey
> delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future
> opportunities.
