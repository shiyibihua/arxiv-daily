## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating
> significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class
> activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional
> neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify
> regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.
> Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more
> generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.
> However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated
> directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains
> limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like
> simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations
> enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In
> this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D
> indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information
> derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve
> frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved
> performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.
