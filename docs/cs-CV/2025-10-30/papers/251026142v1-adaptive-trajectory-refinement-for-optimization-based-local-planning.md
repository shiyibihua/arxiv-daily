## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Trajectory planning for mobile robots in cluttered environments remains a
> major challenge due to narrow passages, where conventional methods often fail
> or generate suboptimal paths. To address this issue, we propose the adaptive
> trajectory refinement algorithm, which consists of two main stages. First, to
> ensure safety at the path-segment level, a segment-wise conservative collision
> test is applied, where risk-prone trajectory path segments are recursively
> subdivided until collision risks are eliminated. Second, to guarantee
> pose-level safety, pose correction based on penetration direction and line
> search is applied, ensuring that each pose in the trajectory is collision-free
> and maximally clear from obstacles. Simulation results demonstrate that the
> proposed method achieves up to 1.69x higher success rates and up to 3.79x
> faster planning times than state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, real-world
> experiments confirm that the robot can safely pass through narrow passages
> while maintaining rapid planning performance.
