## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
> prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
> to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
> approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
> directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
> stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
> novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
> CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
> mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
> signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
> constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
> generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
> CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
> generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
> NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
> was honored with the Innovation Award.
