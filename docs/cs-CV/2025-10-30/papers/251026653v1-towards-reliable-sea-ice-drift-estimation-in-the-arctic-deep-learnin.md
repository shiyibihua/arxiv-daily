## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
> climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
> vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
> has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
> problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
> flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
> which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
> approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
> computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
> present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
> on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
> Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
> accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
> spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
> Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
> consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
> flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
> compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
> sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
> motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
> offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.
