## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
> imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
> methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
> blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
> often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
> propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
> using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
> representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
> from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
> components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
> feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
> training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
> motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
> motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
> demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
> in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.
