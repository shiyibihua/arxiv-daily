## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Tensegrity robots combine rigid rods and elastic cables, offering high
> resilience and deployability but posing major challenges for locomotion control
> due to their underactuated and highly coupled dynamics. This paper introduces a
> morphology-aware reinforcement learning framework that integrates a graph
> neural network (GNN) into the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. By
> representing the robot's physical topology as a graph, the proposed GNN-based
> policy captures coupling among components, enabling faster and more stable
> learning than conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) policies. The method is
> validated on a physical 3-bar tensegrity robot across three locomotion
> primitives, including straight-line tracking and bidirectional turning. It
> shows superior sample efficiency, robustness to noise and stiffness variations,
> and improved trajectory accuracy. Notably, the learned policies transfer
> directly from simulation to hardware without fine-tuning, achieving stable
> real-world locomotion. These results demonstrate the advantages of
> incorporating structural priors into reinforcement learning for tensegrity
> robot control.
