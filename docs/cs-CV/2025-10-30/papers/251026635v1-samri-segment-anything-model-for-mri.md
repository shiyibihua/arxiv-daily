## 💡 一句话要点

**提出SAMRI以解决MRI分割中的泛化问题，通过微调SAM适应MRI模态。**

**关键词**: `医学图像分割` `Segment Anything Model` `MRI适应` `微调策略` `泛化性能`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：MRI分割因对比度、强度不均和协议差异导致CNN方法泛化差。
2. 方法要点：采用两阶段策略微调SAM的掩码解码器，大幅减少训练时间和参数。
3. 实验或效果：在百万MR切片上验证，平均Dice达0.87，泛化能力强。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Accurate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation is crucial for
> clinical decision-making, but remains labor-intensive when performed manually.
> Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods can be accurate and efficient,
> but often generalize poorly to MRI's variable contrast, intensity
> inhomogeneity, and protocols. Although the transformer-based Segment Anything
> Model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable generalizability in natural images,
> existing adaptations often treat MRI as another imaging modality, overlooking
> these modality-specific challenges. We present SAMRI, an MRI-specialized SAM
> trained and validated on 1.1 million labeled MR slices spanning whole-body
> organs and pathologies. We demonstrate that SAM can be effectively adapted to
> MRI by simply fine-tuning its mask decoder using a two-stage strategy, reducing
> training time by 94% and trainable parameters by 96% versus full-model
> retraining. Across diverse MRI segmentation tasks, SAMRI achieves a mean Dice
> of 0.87, delivering state-of-the-art accuracy across anatomical regions and
> robust generalization on unseen structures, particularly small and clinically
> important structures.
