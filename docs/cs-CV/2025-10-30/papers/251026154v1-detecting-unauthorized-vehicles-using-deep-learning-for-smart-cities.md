## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
> location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
> most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
> rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
> (pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
> auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
> accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
> difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
> non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
> paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
> auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
> detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
> 1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
> results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
> detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
> above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
> traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.
