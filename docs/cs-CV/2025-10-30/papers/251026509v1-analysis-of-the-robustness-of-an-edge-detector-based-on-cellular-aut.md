## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
> relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
> weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
> edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
> problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
> of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
> automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
> techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
> the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
> adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
> and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
> prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
> effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
> the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
> that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
> and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
> improvements.
