## 💡 一句话要点

**提出动态上下文感知场景推理框架，利用视觉-语言对齐解决零样本真实世界场景问题**

**关键词**: `零样本学习` `视觉-语言对齐` `场景推理` `上下文感知` `动态环境` `泛化能力`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：AI系统在无标签真实场景中泛化能力不足，限制动态环境部署。
2. 方法要点：集成视觉变换器和语言模型，对齐视觉语义与语言描述，增强上下文理解。
3. 实验或效果：在零样本基准上，场景理解准确率提升达18%，在模糊场景中表现稳健。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
> without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
> understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
> the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
> This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
> leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
> The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
> environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
> integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
> visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
> comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
> global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
> Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
> Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
> over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
> robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
> fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
> interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
> generalization in dynamic real-world settings.
