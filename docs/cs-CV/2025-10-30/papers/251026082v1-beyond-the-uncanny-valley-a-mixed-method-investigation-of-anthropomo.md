## 💡 一句话要点

**研究不同拟人化水平对机器人虐待保护反应的影响，扩展恐怖谷理论至道德领域。**

**关键词**: `机器人拟人化` `恐怖谷理论` `道德反应` `生理数据` `定性分析` `社会机器人`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：机器人拟人化程度如何影响人类对机器人虐待的保护反应和道德关切。
2. 方法要点：结合自我报告、生理数据和定性反思，分析低、中、高拟人化机器人视频。
3. 实验效果：中等拟人化机器人引发最强生理愤怒，道德推理从财产评估转向谴责施虐者。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Robots with anthropomorphic features are increasingly shaping how humans
> perceive and morally engage with them. Our research investigates how different
> levels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse,
> extending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories
> into a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view
> videos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot),
> or high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we
> triangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and
> uncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and
> qualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not
> linear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in
> eeriness and "spine-tingling" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,
> elicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and
> guilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots
> compared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as
> anthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments
> of property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance
> proposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader
> societal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not
> dampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering
> critical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.
