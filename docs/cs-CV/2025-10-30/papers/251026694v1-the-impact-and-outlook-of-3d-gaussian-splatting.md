## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Since its introduction, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly transformed
> the landscape of 3D scene representations, inspiring an extensive body of
> associated research. Follow-up work includes analyses and contributions that
> enhance the efficiency, scalability, and real-world applicability of 3DGS. In
> this summary, we present an overview of several key directions that have
> emerged in the wake of 3DGS. We highlight advances enabling resource-efficient
> training and rendering, the evolution toward dynamic (or four-dimensional,
> 4DGS) representations, and deeper exploration of the mathematical foundations
> underlying its appearance modeling and rendering process. Furthermore, we
> examine efforts to bring 3DGS to mobile and virtual reality platforms, its
> extension to massive-scale environments, and recent progress toward
> near-instant radiance field reconstruction via feed-forward or distributed
> computation. Collectively, these developments illustrate how 3DGS has evolved
> from a breakthrough representation into a versatile and foundational tool for
> 3D vision and graphics.
