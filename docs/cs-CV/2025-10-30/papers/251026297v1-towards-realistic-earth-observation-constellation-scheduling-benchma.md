## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
> flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
> challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
> constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
> real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
> integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
> benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
> $16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
> $300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
> simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
> dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
> provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
> large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
> Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
> scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
> dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
> operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
> learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
> for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
> AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
> efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
> component. Code and data are provided in
> https://github.com/buaa-colalab/AEOSBench.
