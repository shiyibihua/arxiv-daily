## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Autonomous robots in orchards require real-time 3D scene understanding
> despite repetitive row geometry, seasonal appearance changes, and wind-driven
> foliage motion. We present AgriGS-SLAM, a Visual--LiDAR SLAM framework that
> couples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian
> Splatting (3DGS) rendering. Batch rasterization across complementary viewpoints
> recovers orchard structure under occlusions, while a unified gradient-driven
> map lifecycle executed between keyframes preserves fine details and bounds
> memory. Pose refinement is guided by a probabilistic LiDAR-based depth
> consistency term, back-propagated through the camera projection to tighten
> geometry-appearance coupling. We deploy the system on a field platform in apple
> and pear orchards across dormancy, flowering, and harvesting, using a
> standardized trajectory protocol that evaluates both training-view and
> novel-view synthesis to reduce 3DGS overfitting in evaluation. Across seasons
> and sites, AgriGS-SLAM delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and
> steadier trajectories than recent state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines while
> maintaining real-time performance on-tractor. While demonstrated in orchard
> monitoring, the approach can be applied to other outdoor domains requiring
> robust multimodal perception.
