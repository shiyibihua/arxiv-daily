## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
> being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
> finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
> that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
> reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
> stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
> we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
> matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
> diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
> against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
> demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
> perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
> effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
> low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
> ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
> distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
> enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
> guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.
