## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),
> plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical
> applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,
> the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect
> the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine
> bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,
> which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these
> challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network
> (SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a
> scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional
> long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the
> consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic
> level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform
> semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a
> Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a
> feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method
> improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The
> experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior
> segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
> the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as
> a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal
> image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at
> https://github.com/taetiseo09/SA2Net.
