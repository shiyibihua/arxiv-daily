## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The term embodied intelligence (EI) conveys the notion that body morphology,
> material properties, interaction with the environment, and control strategies
> can be purposefully integrated into the process of robotic design to generate
> intelligent behavior; in particular, locomotion and navigation. In this paper,
> we discuss EI as a design principle for advanced microrobotics, with a
> particular focus on co-design -- the simultaneous and interdependent
> development of physical structure and behavioral function. To illustrate the
> contrast between EI-inspired systems and traditional architectures that
> decouple sensing, computation, and actuation, we present and discuss a
> collection of robots developed by the author and his team at the Autonomous
> Microrobotic Systems Laboratory (AMSL). These robots exhibit intelligent
> behavior that emerges from their structural dynamics and the physical
> interaction between their components and with the environment. Platforms such
> as the Bee++, RoBeetle, SMALLBug, SMARTI, WaterStrider, VLEIBot+, and FRISSHBot
> exemplify how feedback loops, decision logics, sensing mechanisms, and smart
> actuation strategies can be embedded into the physical properties of the
> robotic system itself. Along these lines, we contend that co-design is not only
> a method for empirical optimization under constraints, but also an enabler of
> EI, offering a scalable and robust alternative to classical control for
> robotics at the mm-to-cm-scale.
