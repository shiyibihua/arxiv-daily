## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Assessing the severity of artifacts in pediatric brain Magnetic Resonance
> Imaging (MRI) is critical for diagnostic accuracy, especially in low-field
> systems where the signal-to-noise ratio is reduced. Manual quality assessment
> is time-consuming and subjective, motivating the need for robust automated
> solutions. In this work, we propose BRIQA (Balanced Reweighting in Image
> Quality Assessment), which addresses class imbalance in artifact severity
> levels. BRIQA uses gradient-based loss reweighting to dynamically adjust
> per-class contributions and employs a rotating batching scheme to ensure
> consistent exposure to underrepresented classes. Through experiments, no single
> architecture performs best across all artifact types, emphasizing the
> importance of architectural diversity. The rotating batching configuration
> improves performance across metrics by promoting balanced learning when
> combined with cross-entropy loss. BRIQA improves average macro F1 score from
> 0.659 to 0.706, with notable gains in Noise (0.430), Zipper (0.098),
> Positioning (0.097), Contrast (0.217), Motion (0.022), and Banding (0.012)
> artifact severity classification. The code is available at
