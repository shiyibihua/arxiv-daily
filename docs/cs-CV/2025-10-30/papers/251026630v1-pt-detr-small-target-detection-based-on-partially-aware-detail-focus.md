## 📄 摘要（原文）

> To address the challenges in UAV object detection, such as complex
> backgrounds, severe occlusion, dense small objects, and varying lighting
> conditions,this paper proposes PT-DETR based on RT-DETR, a novel detection
> algorithm specifically designed for small objects in UAV imagery. In the
> backbone network, we introduce the Partially-Aware Detail Focus (PADF) Module
> to enhance feature extraction for small objects. Additionally,we design the
> Median-Frequency Feature Fusion (MFFF) module,which effectively improves the
> model's ability to capture small-object details and contextual information.
> Furthermore,we incorporate Focaler-SIoU to strengthen the model's bounding box
> matching capability and increase its sensitivity to small-object features,
> thereby further enhancing detection accuracy and robustness. Compared with
> RT-DETR, our PT-DETR achieves mAP improvements of 1.6% and 1.7% on the
> VisDrone2019 dataset with lower computational complexity and fewer parameters,
> demonstrating its robustness and feasibility for small-object detection tasks.
