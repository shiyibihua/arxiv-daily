## 💡 一句话要点

**提出Group Diffusion以通过跨样本协作增强扩散模型图像生成质量**

**关键词**: `扩散模型` `跨样本注意力` `图像生成` `联合去噪` `生成质量提升`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：传统扩散模型在推理时独立生成图像，未利用跨样本协作信号
2. 方法要点：解锁注意力机制，使其在图像间共享，实现联合去噪和跨样本对应学习
3. 实验或效果：在ImageNet-256x256上实现最高32.2%的FID提升，显示组大小与质量正相关

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> In this work, we explore an untapped signal in diffusion model inference. While all previous methods generate images independently at inference, we instead ask if samples can be generated collaboratively. We propose Group Diffusion, unlocking the attention mechanism to be shared across images, rather than limited to just the patches within an image. This enables images to be jointly denoised at inference time, learning both intra and inter-image correspondence. We observe a clear scaling effect - larger group sizes yield stronger cross-sample attention and better generation quality. Furthermore, we introduce a qualitative measure to capture this behavior and show that its strength closely correlates with FID. Built on standard diffusion transformers, our GroupDiff achieves up to 32.2% FID improvement on ImageNet-256x256. Our work reveals cross-sample inference as an effective, previously unexplored mechanism for generative modeling.
