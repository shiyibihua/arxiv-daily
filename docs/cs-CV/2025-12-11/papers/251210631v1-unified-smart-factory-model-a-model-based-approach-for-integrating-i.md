**关键词**: `智能工厂模型` `可持续制造` `模型驱动系统工程` `关键绩效指标评估` `工业4.0集成`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：制造业中可持续性目标与工厂级实施之间存在信息鸿沟，缺乏系统化映射方法。
2. 方法要点：基于对象过程方法论构建统一框架，集成制造过程、数据流程和关键绩效指标评估。
3. 实验或效果：通过PCB组装案例研究，展示如何建模和映射环境可持续性指标，减少冗余并增强数据收集。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper presents the Unified Smart Factory Model (USFM), a comprehensive framework designed to translate high-level sustainability goals into measurable factory-level indicators with a systematic information map of manufacturing activities. The manufacturing activities were modelled as set of manufacturing, assembly and auxiliary processes using Object Process Methodology, a Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) language. USFM integrates Manufacturing Process and System, Data Process, and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Selection and Assessment in a single framework. Through a detailed case study of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) assembly factory, the paper demonstrates how environmental sustainability KPIs can be selected, modelled, and mapped to the necessary data, highlighting energy consumption and environmental impact metrics. The model's systematic approach can reduce redundancy, minimize the risk of missing critical information, and enhance data collection. The paper concluded that the USFM bridges the gap between sustainability goals and practical implementation, providing significant benefits for industries specifically SMEs aiming to achieve sustainability targets.
