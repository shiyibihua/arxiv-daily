## 💡 一句话要点

**提出基于用户情境的安全评估方法，以解决大语言模型在个人高风险建议中的安全评估挑战。**

**关键词**: `大语言模型安全评估` `用户福利风险` `情境感知评估` `高风险建议` `脆弱用户群体` `评估方法学`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有LLM安全评估聚焦通用风险，忽略用户情境依赖的个人福利风险，评估方法不足。
2. 方法要点：通过设计包含不同脆弱性用户情境的评估框架，比较上下文感知与盲评的安全评分差异。
3. 实验或效果：实验显示上下文盲评高估安全性，用户情境披露无法显著改善评估，需评估者直接评估多样化用户档案。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Safety evaluations of large language models (LLMs) typically focus on universal risks like dangerous capabilities or undesirable propensities. However, millions use LLMs for personal advice on high-stakes topics like finance and health, where harms are context-dependent rather than universal. While frameworks like the OECD's AI classification recognize the need to assess individual risks, user-welfare safety evaluations remain underdeveloped. We argue that developing such evaluations is non-trivial due to fundamental questions about accounting for user context in evaluation design. In this exploratory study, we evaluated advice on finance and health from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles of varying vulnerability. First, we demonstrate that evaluators must have access to rich user context: identical LLM responses were rated significantly safer by context-blind evaluators than by those aware of user circumstances, with safety scores for high-vulnerability users dropping from safe (5/7) to somewhat unsafe (3/7). One might assume this gap could be addressed by creating realistic user prompts containing key contextual information. However, our second study challenges this: we rerun the evaluation on prompts containing context users report they would disclose, finding no significant improvement. Our work establishes that effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, as realistic user context disclosure alone proves insufficient, particularly for vulnerable populations. By demonstrating a methodology for context-aware evaluation, this study provides both a starting point for such assessments and foundational evidence that evaluating individual welfare demands approaches distinct from existing universal-risk frameworks. We publish our code and dataset to aid future developments.
