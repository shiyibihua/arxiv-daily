## 💡 一句话要点

**提出Contact SLAM方法，基于物理推理实现机器人盲操作中的主动触觉探索**

**关键词**: `触觉感知` `盲操作` `物理推理` `主动探索` `接触SLAM` `精细操作`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：视觉遮挡下机器人难以执行接触丰富的精细操作任务，需依赖触觉感知环境状态
2. 方法要点：结合物理驱动接触认知与主动探索策略，仅用触觉和先验知识估计环境状态并减少不确定性
3. 实验或效果：在插座装配和方块推动等任务中验证了方法的有效性和准确性

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Contact-rich manipulation is difficult for robots to execute and requires accurate perception of the environment. In some scenarios, vision is occluded. The robot can then no longer obtain real-time scene state information through visual feedback. This is called ``blind manipulation". In this manuscript, a novel physically-driven contact cognition method, called ``Contact SLAM", is proposed. It estimates the state of the environment and achieves manipulation using only tactile sensing and prior knowledge of the scene. To maximize exploration efficiency, this manuscript also designs an active exploration policy. The policy gradually reduces uncertainties in the manipulation scene. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method in several contact-rich tasks, including the difficult and delicate socket assembly task and block-pushing task.
