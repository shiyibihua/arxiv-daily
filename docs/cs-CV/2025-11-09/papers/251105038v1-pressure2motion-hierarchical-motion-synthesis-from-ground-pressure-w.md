## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We present Pressure2Motion, a novel motion capture algorithm that synthesizes
> human motion from a ground pressure sequence and text prompt. It eliminates the
> need for specialized lighting setups, cameras, or wearable devices, making it
> suitable for privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture
> scenarios. Such a task is severely ill-posed due to the indeterminate nature of
> the pressure signals to full-body motion. To address this issue, we introduce
> Pressure2Motion, a generative model that leverages pressure features as input
> and utilizes a text prompt as a high-level guiding constraint. Specifically,
> our model utilizes a dual-level feature extractor that accurately interprets
> pressure data, followed by a hierarchical diffusion model that discerns
> broad-scale movement trajectories and subtle posture adjustments. Both the
> physical cues gained from the pressure sequence and the semantic guidance
> derived from descriptive texts are leveraged to guide the motion generation
> with precision. To the best of our knowledge, Pressure2Motion is a pioneering
> work in leveraging both pressure data and linguistic priors for motion
> generation, and the established MPL benchmark is the first benchmark for this
> task. Experiments show our method generates high-fidelity, physically plausible
> motions, establishing a new state-of-the-art for this task. The codes and
> benchmarks will be publicly released upon publication.
