## 📄 摘要（原文）

> During laparoscopic surgery, smoke generated by tissue cauterization can
> significantly degrade the visual quality of endoscopic frames, increasing the
> risk of surgical errors and hindering both clinical decision-making and
> computer-assisted visual analysis. Consequently, removing surgical smoke is
> critical to ensuring patient safety and maintaining operative efficiency. In
> this study, we propose the Surgical Atmospheric Model (SurgiATM) for surgical
> smoke removal. SurgiATM statistically bridges a physics-based atmospheric model
> and data-driven deep learning models, combining the superior generalizability
> of the former with the high accuracy of the latter. Furthermore, SurgiATM is
> designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly
> integrated into diverse surgical desmoking architectures to enhance their
> accuracy and stability, better meeting clinical requirements. It introduces
> only two hyperparameters and no additional trainable weights, preserving the
> original network architecture with minimal computational and modification
> overhead. We conduct extensive experiments on three public surgical datasets
> with ten desmoking methods, involving multiple network architectures and
> covering diverse procedures, including cholecystectomy, partial nephrectomy,
> and diaphragm dissection. The results demonstrate that incorporating SurgiATM
> commonly reduces the restoration errors of existing models and relatively
> enhances their generalizability, without adding any trainable layers or
> weights. This highlights the convenience, low cost, effectiveness, and
> generalizability of the proposed method. The code for SurgiATM is released at
> https://github.com/MingyuShengSMY/SurgiATM.
