## 💡 一句话要点

**提出xBD-S12数据集与模型，利用Sentinel卫星图像进行建筑损伤评估。**

**关键词**: `建筑损伤评估` `Sentinel卫星图像` `xBD-S12数据集` `灾害响应` `中等分辨率遥感`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：自然灾害后快速评估建筑损伤，但高分辨率图像可用性有限。
2. 方法要点：构建xBD-S12数据集，结合Sentinel-1和Sentinel-2图像训练模型。
3. 实验或效果：在10米分辨率下能较好检测损伤，复杂模型泛化能力未知。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Natural disasters demand rapid damage assessment to guide humanitarian
> response. Here, we investigate whether medium-resolution Earth observation
> images from the Copernicus program can support building damage assessment,
> complementing very-high resolution imagery with often limited availability. We
> introduce xBD-S12, a dataset of 10,315 pre- and post-disaster image pairs from
> both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, spatially and temporally aligned with the
> established xBD benchmark. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that
> building damage can be detected and mapped rather well in many disaster
> scenarios, despite the moderate 10$\,$m ground sampling distance. We also find
> that, for damage mapping at that resolution, architectural sophistication does
> not seem to bring much advantage: more complex model architectures tend to
> struggle with generalization to unseen disasters, and geospatial foundation
> models bring little practical benefit. Our results suggest that Copernicus
> images are a viable data source for rapid, wide-area damage assessment and
> could play an important role alongside VHR imagery. We release the xBD-S12
> dataset, code, and trained models to support further research.
