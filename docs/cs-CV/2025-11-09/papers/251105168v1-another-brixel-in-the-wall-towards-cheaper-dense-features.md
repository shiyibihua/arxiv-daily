## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Vision foundation models achieve strong performance on both global and
> locally dense downstream tasks. Pretrained on large images, the recent DINOv3
> model family is able to produce very fine-grained dense feature maps, enabling
> state-of-the-art performance. However, computing these feature maps requires
> the input image to be available at very high resolution, as well as large
> amounts of compute due to the squared complexity of the transformer
> architecture. To address these issues, we propose BRIXEL, a simple knowledge
> distillation approach that has the student learn to reproduce its own feature
> maps at higher resolution. Despite its simplicity, BRIXEL outperforms the
> baseline DINOv3 models by large margins on downstream tasks when the resolution
> is kept fixed. Moreover, it is able to produce feature maps that are very
> similar to those of the teacher at a fraction of the computational cost. Code
> and model weights are available at https://github.com/alexanderlappe/BRIXEL.
