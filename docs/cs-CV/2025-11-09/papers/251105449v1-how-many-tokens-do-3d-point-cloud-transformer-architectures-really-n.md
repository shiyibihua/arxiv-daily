## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Recent advances in 3D point cloud transformers have led to state-of-the-art
> results in tasks such as semantic segmentation and reconstruction. However,
> these models typically rely on dense token representations, incurring high
> computational and memory costs during training and inference. In this work, we
> present the finding that tokens are remarkably redundant, leading to
> substantial inefficiency. We introduce gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph
> token merging method that can reduce the token count by up to 90-95% while
> maintaining competitive performance. This finding challenges the prevailing
> assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance and highlights
> that many current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for
> scalability. We validate our method across multiple 3D vision tasks and show
> consistent improvements in computational efficiency. This work is the first to
> assess redundancy in large-scale 3D transformer models, providing insights into
> the development of more efficient 3D foundation architectures. Our code and
> checkpoints are publicly available at https://gitmerge3d.github.io
