## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Robots operating in complex and uncertain environments face considerable
> challenges. Advanced robotic systems often rely on extensive datasets to learn
> manipulation tasks. In contrast, when humans are faced with unfamiliar tasks,
> such as assembling a chair, a common approach is to learn by watching video
> demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning robot
> policies by Retrieving-from-Video (RfV), using analogies from human
> demonstrations to address manipulation tasks. Our system constructs a video
> bank comprising recordings of humans performing diverse daily tasks. To enrich
> the knowledge from these videos, we extract mid-level information, such as
> object affordance masks and hand motion trajectories, which serve as additional
> inputs to enhance the robot model's learning and generalization capabilities.
> We further feature a dual-component system: a video retriever that taps into an
> external video bank to fetch task-relevant video based on task specification,
> and a policy generator that integrates this retrieved knowledge into the
> learning cycle. This approach enables robots to craft adaptive responses to
> various scenarios and generalize to tasks beyond those in the training data.
> Through rigorous testing in multiple simulated and real-world settings, our
> system demonstrates a marked improvement in performance over conventional
> robotic systems, showcasing a significant breakthrough in the field of
> robotics.
