## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of clustering-based
> approaches for self-supervised and unsupervised learning. However, the
> application of clustering is often heuristic, and the optimal methodology
> remains unclear. In this work, we establish connections between these
> unsupervised clustering methods and classical mixture models from statistics.
> Through this framework, we demonstrate significant enhancements to these
> clustering methods, leading to the development of a novel model named SiamMM.
> Our method attains state-of-the-art performance across various self-supervised
> learning benchmarks. Inspection of the learned clusters reveals a strong
> resemblance to unseen ground truth labels, uncovering potential instances of
> mislabeling.
