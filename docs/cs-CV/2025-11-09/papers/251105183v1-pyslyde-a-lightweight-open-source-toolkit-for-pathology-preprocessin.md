**关键词**: `病理图像预处理` `全切片图像分析` `开源工具包` `组织检测` `特征提取`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 病理全切片图像规模大、变异性高，标准化预处理困难
2. 基于OpenSlide构建轻量Python工具，提供组织检测、分块和特征提取API
3. 统一预处理流程，提升可重复性并加速AI数据集生成

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into pathology is advancing
> precision medicine by improving diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient
> outcomes. Digitised whole-slide images (WSIs) capture rich spatial and
> morphological information vital for understanding disease biology, yet their
> gigapixel scale and variability pose major challenges for standardisation and
> analysis. Robust preprocessing, covering tissue detection, tessellation, stain
> normalisation, and annotation parsing is critical but often limited by
> fragmented and inconsistent workflows. We present PySlyde, a lightweight,
> open-source Python toolkit built on OpenSlide to simplify and standardise WSI
> preprocessing. PySlyde provides an intuitive API for slide loading, annotation
> management, tissue detection, tiling, and feature extraction, compatible with
> modern pathology foundation models. By unifying these processes, it streamlines
> WSI preprocessing, enhances reproducibility, and accelerates the generation of
> AI-ready datasets, enabling researchers to focus on model development and
> downstream analysis.
