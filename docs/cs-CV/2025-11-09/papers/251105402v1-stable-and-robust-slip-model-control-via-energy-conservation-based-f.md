## 📄 摘要（原文）

> In this paper, we present an energy-conservation based control architecture
> for stable dynamic motion in quadruped robots. We model the robot as a
> Spring-loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP), a model well-suited to represent the
> bouncing motion characteristic of running gaits observed in various biological
> quadrupeds and bio-inspired robotic systems. The model permits leg-orientation
> control during flight and leg-length control during stance, a design choice
> inspired by natural quadruped behaviors and prevalent in robotic quadruped
> systems. Our control algorithm uses the reduced-order SLIP dynamics of the
> quadruped to track a stable parabolic spline during stance, which is calculated
> using the principle of energy conservation. Through simulations based on the
> design specifications of an actual quadruped robot, Ghost Robotics Minitaur, we
> demonstrate that our control algorithm generates stable bouncing gaits.
> Additionally, we illustrate the robustness of our controller by showcasing its
> ability to maintain stable bouncing even when faced with up to a 10% error in
> sensor measurements.
