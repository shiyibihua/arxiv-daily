## 💡 一句话要点

**提出多模态口腔数据集以促进AI口腔医疗发展**

**关键词**: `多模态数据集` `口腔医疗AI` `视觉语言模型` `异常分类` `诊断报告生成`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：口腔医疗AI缺乏大规模多模态数据集，难以模拟临床复杂性。
2. 方法要点：构建包含图像、文本的多模态数据集，用于微调视觉语言模型。
3. 实验或效果：微调模型在异常分类和诊断报告生成任务上优于基线和GPT-4o。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The advancement of artificial intelligence in oral healthcare relies on the
> availability of large-scale multimodal datasets that capture the complexity of
> clinical practice. In this paper, we present a comprehensive multimodal
> dataset, comprising 8775 dental checkups from 4800 patients collected over
> eight years (2018-2025), with patients ranging from 10 to 90 years of age. The
> dataset includes 50000 intraoral images, 8056 radiographs, and detailed textual
> records, including diagnoses, treatment plans, and follow-up notes. The data
> were collected under standard ethical guidelines and annotated for
> benchmarking. To demonstrate its utility, we fine-tuned state-of-the-art large
> vision-language models, Qwen-VL 3B and 7B, and evaluated them on two tasks:
> classification of six oro-dental anomalies and generation of complete
> diagnostic reports from multimodal inputs. We compared the fine-tuned models
> with their base counterparts and GPT-4o. The fine-tuned models achieved
> substantial gains over these baselines, validating the dataset and underscoring
> its effectiveness in advancing AI-driven oro-dental healthcare solutions. The
> dataset is publicly available, providing an essential resource for future
> research in AI dentistry.
