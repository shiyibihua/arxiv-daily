## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Maintaining system stability and accurate position tracking is imperative in
> networked robotic systems, particularly for haptics-enabled human-robot
> interaction. Recent literature has integrated human biomechanics into the
> stabilizers implemented for teleoperation, enhancing force preservation while
> guaranteeing convergence and safety. However, position desynchronization due to
> imperfect communication and non-passive behaviors remains a challenge. This
> paper proposes a two-port biomechanics-aware passivity-based synchronizer and
> stabilizer, referred to as TBPS2. This stabilizer optimizes position
> synchronization by leveraging human biomechanics while reducing the
> stabilizer's conservatism in its activation. We provide the mathematical design
> synthesis of the stabilizer and the proof of stability. We also conducted a
> series of grid simulations and systematic experiments, comparing their
> performance with that of state-of-the-art solutions under varying time delays
> and environmental conditions.
