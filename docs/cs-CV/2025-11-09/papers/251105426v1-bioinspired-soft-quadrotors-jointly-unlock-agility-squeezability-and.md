## 💡 一句话要点

**提出软框架四旋翼设计以在复杂环境中联合实现敏捷性、可压缩性和碰撞韧性**

**关键词**: `软体机器人` `四旋翼设计` `生物启发` `碰撞韧性` `可压缩性` `敏捷飞行`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 传统四旋翼刚性框架限制碰撞韧性和可压缩性，约束在杂乱环境中的飞行能力
2. 受生物启发，采用软框架设计，实现各向异性刚度和分布式质量能量结构
3. 原型机重405克，实现高速机动、高碰撞韧性和通过狭窄缝隙，扩展飞行能力

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Natural flyers use soft wings to seamlessly enable a wide range of flight
> behaviours, including agile manoeuvres, squeezing through narrow passageways,
> and withstanding collisions. In contrast, conventional quadrotor designs rely
> on rigid frames that support agile flight but inherently limit collision
> resilience and squeezability, thereby constraining flight capabilities in
> cluttered environments. Inspired by the anisotropic stiffness and distributed
> mass-energy structures observed in biological organisms, we introduce
> FlexiQuad, a soft-frame quadrotor design approach that limits this trade-off.
> We demonstrate a 405-gram FlexiQuad prototype, three orders of magnitude more
> compliant than conventional quadrotors, yet capable of acrobatic manoeuvres
> with peak speeds above 80 km/h and linear and angular accelerations exceeding 3
> g and 300 rad/s$^2$, respectively. Analysis demonstrates it can replicate
> accelerations of rigid counterparts up to a thrust-to-weight ratio of 8.
> Simultaneously, FlexiQuad exhibits fourfold higher collision resilience,
> surviving frontal impacts at 5 m/s without damage and reducing destabilising
> forces in glancing collisions by a factor of 39. Its frame can fully compress,
> enabling flight through gaps as narrow as 70% of its nominal width. Our
> analysis identifies an optimal structural softness range, from 0.006 to 0.77
> N/mm, comparable to that of natural flyers' wings, whereby agility,
> squeezability, and collision resilience are jointly achieved for FlexiQuad
> models from 20 to 3000 grams. FlexiQuad expands hovering drone capabilities in
> complex environments, enabling robust physical interactions without
> compromising flight performance.
