## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Adverse weather severely impairs real-world visual perception, while existing
> vision models trained on synthetic data with fixed parameters struggle to
> generalize to complex degradations. To address this, we first construct
> HFLS-Weather, a physics-driven, high-fidelity dataset that simulates diverse
> weather phenomena, and then design a dual-level reinforcement learning
> framework initialized with HFLS-Weather for cold-start training. Within this
> framework, at the local level, weather-specific restoration models are refined
> through perturbation-driven image quality optimization, enabling reward-based
> learning without paired supervision; at the global level, a meta-controller
> dynamically orchestrates model selection and execution order according to scene
> degradation. This framework enables continuous adaptation to real-world
> conditions and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
> adverse weather scenarios. Code is available at
