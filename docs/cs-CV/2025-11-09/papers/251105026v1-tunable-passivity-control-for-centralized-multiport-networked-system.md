## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Centralized Multiport Networked Dynamic (CMND) systems have emerged as a key
> architecture with applications in several complex network systems, such as
> multilateral telerobotics and multi-agent control. These systems consist of a
> hub node/subsystem connecting with multiple remote nodes/subsystems via a
> networked architecture. One challenge for this system is stability, which can
> be affected by non-ideal network artifacts. Conventional passivity-based
> approaches can stabilize the system under specialized applications like
> small-scale networked systems. However, those conventional passive stabilizers
> have several restrictions, such as distributing compensation across subsystems
> in a decentralized manner, limiting flexibility, and, at the same time, relying
> on the restrictive assumptions of node passivity. This paper synthesizes a
> centralized optimal passivity-based stabilization framework for CMND systems.
> It consists of a centralized passivity observer monitoring overall energy flow
> and an optimal passivity controller that distributes the just-needed
> dissipation among various nodes, guaranteeing strict passivity and, thus, L2
> stability. The proposed data-driven model-free approach, i.e., Tunable
> Centralized Optimal Passivity Control (TCoPC), optimizes total performance
> based on the prescribed dissipation distribution strategy while ensuring
> stability. The controller can put high dissipation loads on some sub-networks
> while relaxing the dissipation on other nodes. Simulation results demonstrate
> the proposed frameworks performance in a complex task under different
> time-varying delay scenarios while relaxing the remote nodes minimum phase and
> passivity assumption, enhancing the scalability and generalizability.
