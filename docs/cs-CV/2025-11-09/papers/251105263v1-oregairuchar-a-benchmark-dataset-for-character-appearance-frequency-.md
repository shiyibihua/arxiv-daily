**关键词**: `角色出现频率分析` `动漫数据集` `对象检测基准` `叙事结构研究` `视觉挑战处理`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：分析角色出现频率对理解动漫叙事结构和角色突出性的重要性。
2. 方法要点：构建包含1600帧和2860个边界框的数据集，标注11个主要角色。
3. 实验或效果：基准测试对象检测模型，进行细粒度角色出现时间分析。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The analysis of character appearance frequency is essential for understanding
> narrative structure, character prominence, and story progression in anime. In
> this work, we introduce OregairuChar, a benchmark dataset designed for
> appearance frequency analysis in the anime series My Teen Romantic Comedy
> SNAFU. The dataset comprises 1600 manually selected frames from the third
> season, annotated with 2860 bounding boxes across 11 main characters.
> OregairuChar captures diverse visual challenges, including occlusion, pose
> variation, and inter-character similarity, providing a realistic basis for
> appearance-based studies. To enable quantitative research, we benchmark several
> object detection models on the dataset and leverage their predictions for
> fine-grained, episode-level analysis of character presence over time. This
> approach reveals patterns of character prominence and their evolution within
> the narrative. By emphasizing appearance frequency, OregairuChar serves as a
> valuable resource for exploring computational narrative dynamics and
> character-centric storytelling in stylized media.
