## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Economic constraints, limited availability of datasets for reproducibility
> and shortages of specialized expertise have long been recognized as key
> challenges to the adoption and advancement of predictive maintenance (PdM) in
> the automotive sector. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) presents
> an opportunity to overcome these barriers and speed up the transition of PdM
> from research to industrial practice. Under these conditions, we explore the
> potential of LLM-based agents to support PdM cleaning pipelines. Specifically,
> we focus on maintenance logs, a critical data source for training
> well-performing machine learning (ML) models, but one often affected by errors
> such as typos, missing fields, near-duplicate entries, and incorrect dates. We
> evaluate LLM agents on cleaning tasks involving six distinct types of noise.
> Our findings show that LLMs are effective at handling generic cleaning tasks
> and offer a promising foundation for future industrial applications. While
> domain-specific errors remain challenging, these results highlight the
> potential for further improvements through specialized training and enhanced
> agentic capabilities.
