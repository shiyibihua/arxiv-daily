## 📄 摘要（原文）

> While both shape and texture are fundamental to visual recognition, research
> on deep neural networks (DNNs) has predominantly focused on the latter, leaving
> their geometric understanding poorly probed. Here, we show: first, that
> optimized shapes can act as potent semantic carriers, generating
> high-confidence classifications from inputs defined purely by their geometry;
> second, that they are high-fidelity interpretability tools that precisely
> isolate a model's salient regions; and third, that they constitute a new,
> generalizable adversarial paradigm capable of deceiving downstream visual
> tasks. This is achieved through an end-to-end differentiable framework that
> unifies a powerful Fourier series to parameterize arbitrary shapes, a winding
> number-based mapping to translate them into the pixel grid required by DNNs,
> and signal energy constraints that enhance optimization efficiency while
> ensuring physically plausible shapes. Our work provides a versatile framework
> for probing the geometric world of DNNs and opens new frontiers for challenging
> and understanding machine perception.
