## 📄 摘要（原文）

> As 3D point clouds become a cornerstone of modern technology, the need for
> sophisticated generative models and reliable evaluation metrics has grown
> exponentially. In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics
> for evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer
> Distance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric
> fidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We
> further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation
> and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet
> essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud
> generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on
> directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named
> Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by
> comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with
> traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of
> generated samples. Finally, leveraging recent advancements in transformer-based
> models for point cloud analysis, such as serialized patch attention , we
> propose a new architecture for generating high-fidelity 3D structures, the
> Diffusion Point Transformer. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons
> on the ShapeNet dataset, showing that our model outperforms previous solutions,
> particularly in terms of quality of generated point clouds, achieving new
> state-of-the-art. Code available at
