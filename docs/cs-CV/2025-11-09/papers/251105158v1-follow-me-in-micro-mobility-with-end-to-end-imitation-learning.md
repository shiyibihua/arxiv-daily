## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Autonomous micro-mobility platforms face challenges from the perspective of
> the typical deployment environment: large indoor spaces or urban areas that are
> potentially crowded and highly dynamic. While social navigation algorithms have
> progressed significantly, optimizing user comfort and overall user experience
> over other typical metrics in robotics (e.g., time or distance traveled) is
> understudied. Specifically, these metrics are critical in commercial
> applications. In this paper, we show how imitation learning delivers smoother
> and overall better controllers, versus previously used manually-tuned
> controllers. We demonstrate how DAAV's autonomous wheelchair achieves
> state-of-the-art comfort in follow-me mode, in which it follows a human
> operator assisting persons with reduced mobility (PRM). This paper analyzes
> different neural network architectures for end-to-end control and demonstrates
> their usability in real-world production-level deployments.
