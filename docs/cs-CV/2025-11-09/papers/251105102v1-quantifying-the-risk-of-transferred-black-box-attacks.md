## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Neural networks have become pervasive across various applications, including
> security-related products. However, their widespread adoption has heightened
> concerns regarding vulnerability to adversarial attacks. With emerging
> regulations and standards emphasizing security, organizations must reliably
> quantify risks associated with these attacks, particularly regarding
> transferred adversarial attacks, which remain challenging to evaluate
> accurately. This paper investigates the complexities involved in resilience
> testing against transferred adversarial attacks. Our analysis specifically
> addresses black-box evasion attacks, highlighting transfer-based attacks due to
> their practical significance and typically high transferability between neural
> network models. We underline the computational infeasibility of exhaustively
> exploring high-dimensional input spaces to achieve complete test coverage. As a
> result, comprehensive adversarial risk mapping is deemed impractical. To
> mitigate this limitation, we propose a targeted resilience testing framework
> that employs surrogate models strategically selected based on Centered Kernel
> Alignment (CKA) similarity. By leveraging surrogate models exhibiting both high
> and low CKA similarities relative to the target model, the proposed approach
> seeks to optimize coverage of adversarial subspaces. Risk estimation is
> conducted using regression-based estimators, providing organizations with
> realistic and actionable risk quantification.
