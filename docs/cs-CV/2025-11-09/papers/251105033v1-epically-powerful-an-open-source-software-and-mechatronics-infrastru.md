## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Epically Powerful is an open-source robotics infrastructure that streamlines
> the underlying framework of wearable robotic systems - managing communication
> protocols, clocking, actuator commands, visualization, sensor data acquisition,
> data logging, and more - while also providing comprehensive guides for hardware
> selection, system assembly, and controller implementation. Epically Powerful
> contains a code base enabling simplified user implementation via Python that
> seamlessly interfaces with various commercial state-of-the-art quasi-direct
> drive (QDD) actuators, single-board computers, and common sensors, provides
> example controllers, and enables real-time visualization. To further support
> device development, the package also includes a recommended parts list and
> compatibility guide and detailed documentation on hardware and software
> implementation. The goal of Epically Powerful is to lower the barrier to
> developing and deploying custom wearable robotic systems without a
> pre-specified form factor, enabling researchers to go from raw hardware to
> modular, robust devices quickly and effectively. Though originally designed
> with wearable robotics in mind, Epically Powerful is broadly applicable to
> other robotic domains that utilize QDD actuators, single-board computers, and
> sensors for closed-loop control.
