**关键词**: `NeRF重建` `图像贡献评估` `数据估值` `重建质量指标` `野外场景`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：野外图像集在NeRF重建中质量不均，导致输入效用差异。
2. 方法要点：通过重建质量指标（PSNR和MSE）量化每张图像的贡献。
3. 实验或效果：验证中移除低贡献图像，测量对重建保真度的影响。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Data valuation and monetization are becoming increasingly important across domains such as eXtended Reality (XR) and digital media. In the context of 3D scene reconstruction from a set of images -- whether casually or professionally captured -- not all inputs contribute equally to the final output. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) enable photorealistic 3D reconstruction of scenes by optimizing a volumetric radiance field given a set of images. However, in-the-wild scenes often include image captures of varying quality, occlusions, and transient objects, resulting in uneven utility across inputs. In this paper we propose a method to quantify the individual contribution of each image to NeRF-based reconstructions of in-the-wild image sets. Contribution is assessed through reconstruction quality metrics based on PSNR and MSE. We validate our approach by removing low-contributing images during training and measuring the resulting impact on reconstruction fidelity.
