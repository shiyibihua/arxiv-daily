## 💡 一句话要点

**提出基于提示工程与LLM评估的框架，以解决中医翻译中意象思维传达的难题。**

**关键词**: `中医翻译` `提示工程` `大语言模型评估` `隐喻识别` `人机协同框架`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：中医理论依赖隐喻和转喻的意象思维，现有英译难以重建概念网络。
2. 方法要点：采用人机协同框架，通过提示引导DeepSeek识别并翻译隐喻和转喻。
3. 实验或效果：模拟读者评估显示，提示调整的LLM翻译在五个认知维度表现最佳。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Traditional Chinese Medicine theory is built on imagistic thinking, in which medical principles and diagnostic and therapeutic logic are structured through metaphor and metonymy. However, existing English translations largely rely on literal rendering, making it difficult for target-language readers to reconstruct the underlying conceptual networks and apply them in clinical practice. This study adopted a human-in-the-loop framework and selected four passages from the medical canon Huangdi Neijing that are fundamental in theory. Through prompt-based cognitive scaffolding, DeepSeek V3.1 was guided to identify metaphor and metonymy in the source text and convey the theory in translation. In the evaluation stage, ChatGPT 5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Pro were instructed by prompts to simulate three types of real-world readers. Human translations, baseline model translations, and prompt-adjusted translations were scored by the simulated readers across five cognitive dimensions, followed by structured interviews and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results show that the prompt-adjusted LLM translations perform best across all five dimensions, with high cross-model and cross-role consistency. The interview themes reveal differences between human and machine translation, effective strategies for metaphor and metonymy transfer, and readers' cognitive preferences. This study provides a cognitive, efficient and replicable HITL methodological pathway for translation of ancient, concept-dense texts like TCM.
