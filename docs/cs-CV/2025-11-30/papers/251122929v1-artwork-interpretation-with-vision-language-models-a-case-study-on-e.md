## 💡 一句话要点

**评估视觉语言模型在艺术品情感与符号识别中的能力，发现其在具体图像表现良好但抽象符号识别困难**

**关键词**: `视觉语言模型` `艺术品情感分析` `符号识别` `定性评估` `抽象图像处理`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：研究当前视觉语言模型能否检测艺术品中的情感表达与符号，涉及抽象艺术和历史变化
2. 方法要点：通过案例研究，使用三个VLMs对艺术品进行四组复杂度递增的问题测试，并进行专家定性评估
3. 实验或效果：模型能识别图像内容和情感，但在高度抽象或符号化图像中表现不佳，且存在答案不一致问题

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Emotions are a fundamental aspect of artistic expression. Due to their abstract nature, there is a broad spectrum of emotion realization in artworks. These are subject to historical change and their analysis requires expertise in art history. In this article, we investigate which aspects of emotional expression can be detected by current (2025) vision language models (VLMs). We present a case study of three VLMs (Llava-Llama and two Qwen models) in which we ask these models four sets of questions of increasing complexity about artworks (general content, emotional content, expression of emotions, and emotion symbols) and carry out a qualitative expert evaluation. We find that the VLMs recognize the content of the images surprisingly well and often also which emotions they depict and how they are expressed. The models perform best for concrete images but fail for highly abstract or highly symbolic images. Reliable recognition of symbols remains fundamentally difficult. Furthermore, the models continue to exhibit the well-known LLM weakness of providing inconsistent answers to related questions.
