## 💡 一句话要点

**首次在完整基准数据集上评估恶意软件聚类，并纳入良性样本以验证性能**

**关键词**: `恶意软件聚类` `基准数据集` `聚类算法评估` `良性样本` `大规模实验`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：恶意软件聚类研究缺乏对完整基准数据集和良性样本的全面评估，当前最优方法不明确。
2. 方法要点：在Bodmas和Ember两个大型公开基准数据集上，评估多种聚类算法，并扩展任务以包含良性样本。
3. 实验或效果：发现纳入良性样本不显著降低聚类质量，K-Means和BIRCH表现最佳，优于DBSCAN和HAC。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Recent years have shown that malware attacks still happen with high frequency. Malware experts seek to categorize and classify incoming samples to confirm their trustworthiness or prove their maliciousness. One of the ways in which groups of malware samples can be identified is through malware clustering. Despite the efforts of the community, malware clustering which incorporates benign samples has been under-explored. Moreover, despite the availability of larger public benchmark malware datasets, malware clustering studies have avoided fully utilizing these datasets in their experiments, often resorting to small datasets with only a few families. Additionally, the current state-of-the-art solutions for malware clustering remain unclear. In our study, we evaluate malware clustering quality and establish the state-of-the-art on Bodmas and Ember - two large public benchmark malware datasets. Ours is the first study of malware clustering performed on whole malware benchmark datasets. Additionally, we extend the malware clustering task by incorporating benign samples. Our results indicate that incorporating benign samples does not significantly degrade clustering quality. We find that there are significant differences in the quality of the created clusters between Ember and Bodmas, as well as a private industry dataset. Contrary to popular opinion, our top clustering performers are K-Means and BIRCH, with DBSCAN and HAC falling behind.
