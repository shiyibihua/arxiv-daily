## 💡 一句话要点

**提出Rectified MeanFlow以在整流轨迹上高效实现一步生成建模**

**关键词**: `生成建模` `整流流` `一步采样` `平均速度场` `训练效率` `图像生成`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：基于流的生成模型采样依赖昂贵ODE积分，一步采样方法如Rectified Flow需多步迭代，MeanFlow在弯曲流上训练慢且噪声大。
2. 方法要点：Rectified MeanFlow在整流轨迹上建模平均速度场，仅需单步reflow，无需完美直线化，并引入截断启发式减少曲率。
3. 实验或效果：在ImageNet多分辨率上，Re-MeanFlow在样本质量和训练效率上优于先前一步流蒸馏和Rectified Flow方法。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong performance, yet sampling typically relies on expensive numerical integration of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Rectified Flow enables one-step sampling by learning nearly straight probability paths, but achieving such straightness requires multiple computationally intensive reflow iterations. MeanFlow achieves one-step generation by directly modeling the average velocity over time; however, when trained on highly curved flows, it suffers from slow convergence and noisy supervision. To address these limitations, we propose Rectified MeanFlow, a framework that models the mean velocity field along the rectified trajectory using only a single reflow step. This eliminates the need for perfectly straightened trajectories while enabling efficient training. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective truncation heuristic that aims to reduce residual curvature and further improve performance. Extensive experiments on ImageNet at 64, 256, and 512 resolutions show that Re-MeanFlow consistently outperforms prior one-step flow distillation and Rectified Flow methods in both sample quality and training efficiency.
