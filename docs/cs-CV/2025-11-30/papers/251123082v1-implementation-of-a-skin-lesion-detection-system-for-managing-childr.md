**关键词**: `皮肤病变检测` `集成学习` `特应性皮炎` `数字医疗` `深度学习模型`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：特应性皮炎诊断依赖主观评估，易误诊，且临床图像质量低，现有系统需兼顾准确性与响应速度。
2. 方法要点：通过集成多种深度学习模型，构建ENSEL系统，增强诊断准确性。
3. 实验或效果：使用用户拍摄图像验证，系统在多数图像中实现高召回率，处理速度低于1秒。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The amendments made to the Data 3 Act and impact of COVID-19 have fostered the growth of digital healthcare market and promoted the use of medical data in artificial intelligence in South Korea. Atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, is diagnosed via subjective evaluations without using objective diagnostic methods, thereby increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. It is also similar to psoriasis in appearance, further complicating its accurate diagnosis. Existing studies on skin diseases have used high-quality dermoscopic image datasets, but such high-quality images cannot be obtained in actual clinical settings. Moreover, existing systems must ensure accuracy and fast response times. To this end, an ensemble learning-based skin lesion detection system (ENSEL) was proposed herein. ENSEL enhanced diagnostic accuracy by integrating various deep learning models via an ensemble approach. Its performance was verified by conducting skin lesion detection experiments using images of skin lesions taken by actual users. Its accuracy and response time were measured using randomly sampled skin disease images. Results revealed that ENSEL achieved high recall in most images and less than 1s s processing speed. This study contributes to the objective diagnosis of skin lesions and promotes the advancement of digital healthcare.
