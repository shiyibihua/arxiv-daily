**关键词**: `船舶活动监测` `AIS数据重建` `波罗的海交通分析` `开放数据应用` `空间密度映射`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：如何从开放AIS数据中准确重建沿海船舶活动，以支持导航安全和环境评估。
2. 方法要点：开发数据清洗与重建方法，并构建旅程模型以生成船舶计数、交通估计和空间密度图。
3. 实验或效果：在波罗的海2024年8-10月数据中，平均每天有≥4000艘船舶同时活动，结果与专有数据研究误差在20%以内。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Understanding past and present maritime activity patterns is critical for navigation safety, environmental assessment, and commercial operations. An increasing number of services now openly provide positioning data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) via ground-based receivers. We show that coastal vessel activity can be reconstructed from open access data with high accuracy, even with limited data quality and incomplete receiver coverage. For three months of open AIS data in the Baltic Sea from August to October 2024, we present (i) cleansing and reconstruction methods to improve the data quality, and (ii) a journey model that converts AIS message data into vessel counts, traffic estimates, and spatially resolved vessel density at a resolution of $\sim$400 m. Vessel counts are provided, along with their uncertainties, for both moving and stationary activity. Vessel density maps also enable the identification of port locations, and we infer the most crowded and busiest coastal areas in the Baltic Sea. We find that on average, $\gtrsim$4000 vessels simultaneously operate in the Baltic Sea, and more than 300 vessels enter or leave the area each day. Our results agree within 20\% with previous studies relying on proprietary data.
