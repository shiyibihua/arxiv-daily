## 💡 一句话要点

**评估图像质量问题对视觉语言模型产品描述准确性的影响，聚焦盲人与低视力人群需求。**

**关键词**: `视觉语言模型` `图像质量评估` `盲人与低视力辅助` `产品描述生成` `人机交互` `模型可靠性`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：图像质量问题（如模糊、构图不当）如何影响VLM生成描述的准确性，是否满足BLV人群信息需求。
2. 方法要点：基于86名BLV人群调查，系统评估图像质量问题对VLM描述的影响。
3. 实验或效果：无质量问题时模型准确率98%，有质量问题降至75%，问题叠加时显著恶化。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly used by blind and low-vision (BLV) people to identify and understand products in their everyday lives, such as food, personal products, and household goods. Despite their prevalence, we lack an empirical understanding of how common image quality issues, like blur and misframing of items, affect the accuracy of VLM-generated captions and whether resulting captions meet BLV people's information needs. Grounded in a survey with 86 BLV people, we systematically evaluate how image quality issues affect captions generated by VLMs. We show that the best model recognizes products in images with no quality issues with 98% accuracy, but drops to 75% accuracy overall when quality issues are present, worsening considerably as issues compound. We discuss the need for model evaluations that center on disabled people's experiences throughout the process and offer concrete recommendations for HCI and ML researchers to make VLMs more reliable for BLV people.
