**关键词**: `超低场MRI` `图像增强` `数据增强` `深度学习` `图像到图像翻译`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 超低场MRI图像存在信噪比低、分辨率差和对比度偏差问题
2. 采用任务适应数据增强，包括在高场数据上执行辅助任务
3. 在ULF-EnC挑战中验证，显著改善图像保真度，排名靠前

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Ultra-low-field (ULF) MRI promises broader accessibility but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), reduced spatial resolution, and contrasts that deviate from high-field standards. Imageto- image translation can map ULF images to a high-field appearance, yet efficacy is limited by scarce paired training data. Working within the ULF-EnC challenge constraints (50 paired 3D volumes; no external data), we study how task-adapted data augmentations impact a standard deep model for ULF image enhancement. We show that strong, diverse augmentations, including auxiliary tasks on high-field data, substantially improve fidelity. Our submission ranked third by brain-masked SSIM on the public validation leaderboard and fourth by the official score on the final test leaderboard.
