**关键词**: `类增量学习` `参数高效` `LoRA适配` `插件扩展` `非预训练场景` `特征聚合`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 现有类增量学习方法受遗忘或稳定性-可塑性困境限制，扩展方法参数开销大。
2. DLC使用LoRA注入任务特定残差到基础模型，并引入轻量加权单元减少干扰。
3. 在ImageNet-100上，仅用4%参数实现8%准确率提升，超越固定内存预算下先进方法。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Existing class-incremental learning (CIL) approaches based on replay or knowledge distillation are often constrained by forgetting or the stability-plasticity dilemma. Some expansion-based approaches could achieve higher accuracy. However, they always require significant parameter increases. In this paper, we propose a plugin extension paradigm termed the Deployment of extra LoRA Components (DLC) for non-pre-trained CIL scenarios.We treat the feature extractor trained through replay or distillation as a base model with rich knowledge. For each task, we use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to inject task-specific residuals into the base model's deep layers. During inference, representations with task-specific residuals are aggregated to produce classification predictions. To mitigate interference from non-target LoRA plugins, we introduce a lightweight weighting unit. This unit learns to assign importance scores to different LoRA-tuned representations. Like downloadable contents in software, our method serves as a plug-and-play enhancement that efficiently extends the base methods. Remarkably, on the large-scale ImageNet-100, with merely 4 % of the parameters of a standard ResNet-18, our DLC model achieves a significant 8 % improvement in accuracy, demonstrating exceptional efficiency. Moreover, it could surpass state-of-the-art methods under the fixed memory budget.
