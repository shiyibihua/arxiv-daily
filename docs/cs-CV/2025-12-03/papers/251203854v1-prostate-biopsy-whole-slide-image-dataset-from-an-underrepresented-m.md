## 💡 一句话要点

**发布中东地区前列腺活检全切片图像数据集，支持病理AI模型跨人群验证。**

**关键词**: `前列腺活检` `全切片图像` `中东人群数据集` `病理AI验证` `跨扫描仪鲁棒性` `Gleason评分`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 问题：现有病理数据集多代表西方人群，AI模型在中东等欠数字化地区的泛化性未知。
2. 方法：收集伊拉克185名患者的339张前列腺活检全切片图像，提供Gleason评分和病理分级。
3. 效果：数据集支持分级一致性分析、颜色归一化和跨扫描仪鲁棒性评估，促进全球多样化人群的AI模型开发。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in digital pathology. Publicly available histopathology datasets remain scarce, and those that do exist predominantly represent Western populations. Consequently, the generalizability of AI models to populations from less digitized regions, such as the Middle East, is largely unknown. This motivates the public release of our dataset to support the development and validation of pathology AI models across globally diverse populations. We present 339 whole-slide images of prostate core needle biopsies from a consecutive series of 185 patients collected in Erbil, Iraq. The slides are associated with Gleason scores and International Society of Urological Pathology grades assigned independently by three pathologists. Scanning was performed using two high-throughput scanners (Leica and Hamamatsu) and one compact scanner (Grundium). All slides were de-identified and are provided in their native formats without further conversion. The dataset enables grading concordance analyses, color normalization, and cross-scanner robustness evaluations. Data will be deposited in the Bioimage Archive (BIA) under accession code: to be announced (TBA), and released under a CC BY 4.0 license.
