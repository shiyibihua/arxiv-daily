## 💡 一句话要点

**提出厚价值模型以实现AI与机构的全栈对齐，解决价值表示与集体利益问题。**

**关键词**: `AI对齐` `价值表示` `规范性推理` `集体利益` `机构设计` `厚价值模型`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有AI对齐方法难以区分价值与偏好，无法有效建模集体利益和进行规范性推理。
2. 方法要点：引入厚价值模型，结构化表示价值和规范，支持区分持久价值与短暂偏好。
3. 实验或效果：在AI价值管理、规范性智能体、双赢谈判系统等五个领域展示应用潜力。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Beneficial societal outcomes cannot be guaranteed by aligning individual AI systems with the intentions of their operators or users. Even an AI system that is perfectly aligned to the intentions of its operating organization can lead to bad outcomes if the goals of that organization are misaligned with those of other institutions and individuals. For this reason, we need full-stack alignment, the concurrent alignment of AI systems and the institutions that shape them with what people value. This can be done without imposing a particular vision of individual or collective flourishing. We argue that current approaches for representing values, such as utility functions, preference orderings, or unstructured text, struggle to address these and other issues effectively. They struggle to distinguish values from other signals, to support principled normative reasoning, and to model collective goods. We propose thick models of value will be needed. These structure the way values and norms are represented, enabling systems to distinguish enduring values from fleeting preferences, to model the social embedding of individual choices, and to reason normatively, applying values in new domains. We demonstrate this approach in five areas: AI value stewardship, normatively competent agents, win-win negotiation systems, meaning-preserving economic mechanisms, and democratic regulatory institutions.
