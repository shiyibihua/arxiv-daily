## 💡 一句话要点

**提出DIG框架，根据查询类型自适应选择帧策略以提升长视频理解效率与性能**

**关键词**: `长视频理解` `帧选择` `查询类型` `大型多模态模型` `自适应策略`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：长视频理解中，现有查询感知帧选择方法计算开销大，且未区分查询类型。
2. 方法要点：基于查询类型（全局与局部），DIG采用均匀采样或专用管道自适应选择帧，无需训练。
3. 实验或效果：在三个基准测试中，DIG优于基线，输入帧数达256时仍能提升LMM性能。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The application of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to long-form video understanding is constrained by limited context lengths and the computationally prohibitive cost of processing dense video tokens. Consequently, recent research has focused on query-aware frame selection, methods that often incur significant computational overhead. This paper challenges the assumption that such complex search mechanisms are universally necessary. We first identify and validate a query typology distinguishing between global query and localized query. We demonstrate that while uniform sampling is both effective and efficient for global queries, localized queries indeed necessitate query-aware selection for optimal performance. Building on this insight, we propose DIG, a training-free frame selection framework that adapts its strategy based on the query type. Specifically,DIG employs efficient uniform sampling for global queries while activating a specialized pipeline to extract query-relevant frames for localized queries. Experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that DIG consistently outperforms existing baselines and robustly improves LMM performance, even when scaling the input frame count to 256.
