**关键词**: `呼吸率测量` `摄像头监测` `鲁棒方法` `远程健康监测` `视频分析`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有摄像头呼吸率测量方法在非理想条件下精度不足或鲁棒性差。
2. 方法要点：结合数学变换，硬件需求低，相对误差小于5%，对运动失真具有更强抵抗力。
3. 实验或效果：在14名志愿者超2.5小时视频上测试，平均绝对误差0.57次/分钟，优于先前工作。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Proliferation of cheap and accessible cameras makes it possible to measure a subject's breath rate from video footage alone. Recent works on this topic have proposed a variety of approaches for accurately measuring human breath rate, however they are either tested in near-ideal conditions, or produce results that are not sufficiently accurate. The present study proposes a more robust method to measure breath rate in humans with minimal hardware requirements using a combination of mathematical transforms with a relative deviation from the ground truth of less than 5%. The method was tested on videos taken from 14 volunteers with a total duration of over 2 hours 30 minutes. The obtained results were compared to reference data and the average mean absolute error was found to be at 0.57 respirations per minute, which is noticeably better than the results from previous works. The breath rate measurement method proposed in the present article is more resistant to distortions caused by subject movement and thus allows one to remotely measure the subject's breath rate without any significant limitations on the subject's behavior.
