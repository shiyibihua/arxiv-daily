## 💡 一句话要点

**提出文本打印图像以弥合图像-文本模态差距，支持低成本文本中心训练大型视觉语言模型**

**关键词**: `文本中心训练` `模态差距` `合成图像生成` `大型视觉语言模型` `低成本数据扩展`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：仅用文本训练大型视觉语言模型因模态差距导致性能有限，图像收集成本高且受限
2. 方法要点：通过将文本直接渲染到白色画布生成合成图像，低成本投影文本到图像模态，保留语义
3. 实验或效果：在四个模型和七个基准上，文本打印图像比扩散模型生成的图像更有效，支持数据增强

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been applied to diverse VQA tasks. However, achieving practical performance typically requires task-specific fine-tuning with large numbers of image-text pairs, which are costly to collect. In this work, we study text-centric training, a setting where only textual descriptions are available and no real images are provided, as a paradigm for low-cost data scaling. Unlike images, whose collection is often restricted by privacy constraints and scarcity in niche domains, text is widely available. Moreover, text is easily editable, enabling automatic diversification and expansion with LLMs at minimal human effort. While this offers clear advantages over image collection in terms of scalability and cost, training on raw text without images still yields limited gains on VQA tasks because of the image-text modality gap. To address this issue, we propose a Text-Printed Image (TPI), which generates synthetic images by directly rendering the given textual description on a plain white canvas. This simple rendering projects text into the image modality and can be integrated into arbitrary existing LVLM training pipelines at low cost. Moreover, TPI preserves the semantics of the text, whereas text-to-image models often fail to do. Across four models and seven benchmarks, our systematic experiments show that TPI enables more effective text-centric training than synthetic images generated by a diffusion model. We further explore TPI as a low-cost data-augmentation strategy and demonstrate its practical utility. Overall, our findings highlight the significant potential of text-centric training and, more broadly, chart a path toward fully automated data generation for LVLMs.
