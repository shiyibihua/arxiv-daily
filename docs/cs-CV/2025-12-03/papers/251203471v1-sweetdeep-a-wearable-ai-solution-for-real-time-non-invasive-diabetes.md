**关键词**: `可穿戴设备` `糖尿病筛查` `轻量神经网络` `实时检测` `非侵入性监测`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：全球2型糖尿病增长需可扩展、低成本筛查方法，现有生化检测侵入性强且昂贵。
2. 方法要点：使用三星Galaxy Watch 7在自由生活条件下收集285名参与者的生理和人口数据，训练少于3000参数的紧凑神经网络。
3. 实验或效果：在三折交叉验证中达到82.5%患者级准确率，允许模型在低置信度预测上弃权后，剩余患者准确率提升至84.5%。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The global rise in type 2 diabetes underscores the need for scalable and cost-effective screening methods. Current diagnosis requires biochemical assays, which are invasive and costly. Advances in consumer wearables have enabled early explorations of machine learning-based disease detection, but prior studies were limited to controlled settings. We present SweetDeep, a compact neural network trained on physiological and demographic data from 285 (diabetic and non-diabetic) participants in the EU and MENA regions, collected using Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 devices in free-living conditions over six days. Each participant contributed multiple 2-minute sensor recordings per day, totaling approximately 20 recordings per individual. Despite comprising fewer than 3,000 parameters, SweetDeep achieves 82.5% patient-level accuracy (82.1% macro-F1, 79.7% sensitivity, 84.6% specificity) under three-fold cross-validation, with an expected calibration error of 5.5%. Allowing the model to abstain on less than 10% of low-confidence patient predictions yields an accuracy of 84.5% on the remaining patients. These findings demonstrate that combining engineered features with lightweight architectures can support accurate, rapid, and generalizable detection of type 2 diabetes in real-world wearable settings.
