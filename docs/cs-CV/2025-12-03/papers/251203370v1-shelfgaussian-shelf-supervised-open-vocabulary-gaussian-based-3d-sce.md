**关键词**: `开放词汇3D场景理解` `高斯表示学习` `多模态融合` `现成模型监督` `零样本语义占据预测` `无人地面车辆应用`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 现有高斯方法在3D场景理解中面临封闭语义监督或纯2D自监督的局限性，导致渲染能力缺失或几何退化。
2. 引入多模态高斯变换器，使高斯能从多传感器模态查询特征，并结合现成监督学习范式在2D和3D层面联合优化。
3. 在Occ3D-nuScenes上实现零样本语义占据预测的先进性能，并在无人地面车辆上评估野外场景表现。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We introduce ShelfGaussian, an open-vocabulary multi-modal Gaussian-based 3D scene understanding framework supervised by off-the-shelf vision foundation models (VFMs). Gaussian-based methods have demonstrated superior performance and computational efficiency across a wide range of scene understanding tasks. However, existing methods either model objects as closed-set semantic Gaussians supervised by annotated 3D labels, neglecting their rendering ability, or learn open-set Gaussian representations via purely 2D self-supervision, leading to degraded geometry and limited to camera-only settings. To fully exploit the potential of Gaussians, we propose a Multi-Modal Gaussian Transformer that enables Gaussians to query features from diverse sensor modalities, and a Shelf-Supervised Learning Paradigm that efficiently optimizes Gaussians with VFM features jointly at 2D image and 3D scene levels. We evaluate ShelfGaussian on various perception and planning tasks. Experiments on Occ3D-nuScenes demonstrate its state-of-the-art zero-shot semantic occupancy prediction performance. ShelfGaussian is further evaluated on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to assess its in the-wild performance across diverse urban scenarios.
