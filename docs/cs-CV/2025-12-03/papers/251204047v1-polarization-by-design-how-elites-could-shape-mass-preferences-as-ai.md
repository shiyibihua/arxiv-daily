## 💡 一句话要点

**提出动态模型分析AI降低说服成本下精英如何策略性设计偏好分布以影响民主决策**

**关键词**: `AI说服技术` `偏好分布设计` `民主决策模型` `极化动态` `精英策略` `成本降低效应`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：AI降低说服成本使精英能更精准塑造公众偏好，偏好分布成为可设计对象，影响民主稳定
2. 方法要点：构建动态模型，精英在说服成本和多数规则约束下选择重塑偏好分布，分析单精英和双精英交替场景
3. 实验或效果：单精英干预导致极化加剧，双精英场景下技术可能增强或减弱极化，取决于环境条件

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> In democracies, major policy decisions typically require some form of majority or consensus, so elites must secure mass support to govern. Historically, elites could shape support only through limited instruments like schooling and mass media; advances in AI-driven persuasion sharply reduce the cost and increase the precision of shaping public opinion, making the distribution of preferences itself an object of deliberate design. We develop a dynamic model in which elites choose how much to reshape the distribution of policy preferences, subject to persuasion costs and a majority rule constraint. With a single elite, any optimal intervention tends to push society toward more polarized opinion profiles - a ``polarization pull'' - and improvements in persuasion technology accelerate this drift. When two opposed elites alternate in power, the same technology also creates incentives to park society in ``semi-lock'' regions where opinions are more cohesive and harder for a rival to overturn, so advances in persuasion can either heighten or dampen polarization depending on the environment. Taken together, cheaper persuasion technologies recast polarization as a strategic instrument of governance rather than a purely emergent social byproduct, with important implications for democratic stability as AI capabilities advance.
