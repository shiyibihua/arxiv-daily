## 💡 一句话要点

**提出BlackCAtt黑盒因果攻击算法，利用因果像素集对目标检测器进行可解释、不可感知的攻击。**

**关键词**: `黑盒攻击` `目标检测器` `因果像素` `对抗扰动` `可解释性` `架构无关`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有对抗扰动方法多为白盒且架构特定，缺乏可解释性，难以分析攻击机制。
2. 方法要点：BlackCAtt结合因果像素和目标检测器的边界框，构建黑盒、架构无关的攻击，导致检测框丢失、修改或新增。
3. 实验或效果：在COCO数据集上，攻击效果优于基线，移除检测提升2.7倍，修改检测提升3.86倍，触发虚假检测提升5.75倍，攻击接近原图不可感知。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Adversarial perturbations are a useful way to expose vulnerabilities in object detectors. Existing perturbation methods are frequently white-box and architecture specific. More importantly, while they are often successful, it is rarely clear why they work. Insights into the mechanism of this success would allow developers to understand and analyze these attacks, as well as fine-tune the model to prevent them. This paper presents BlackCAtt, a black-box algorithm and a tool, which uses minimal, causally sufficient pixel sets to construct explainable, imperceptible, reproducible, architecture-agnostic attacks on object detectors. BlackCAtt combines causal pixels with bounding boxes produced by object detectors to create adversarial attacks that lead to the loss, modification or addition of a bounding box. BlackCAtt works across different object detectors of different sizes and architectures, treating the detector as a black box. We compare the performance of BlackCAtt with other black-box attack methods and show that identification of causal pixels leads to more precisely targeted and less perceptible attacks. On the COCO test dataset, our approach is 2.7 times better than the baseline in removing a detection, 3.86 times better in changing a detection, and 5.75 times better in triggering new, spurious, detections. The attacks generated by BlackCAtt are very close to the original image, and hence imperceptible, demonstrating the power of causal pixels.
