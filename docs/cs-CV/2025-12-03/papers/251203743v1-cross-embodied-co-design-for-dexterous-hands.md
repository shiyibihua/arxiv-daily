## 💡 一句话要点

**提出协同设计框架以优化灵巧手形态与控制策略**

**关键词**: `灵巧手设计` `协同设计` `跨具身控制` `形态优化` `机器人操作`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：灵巧操作受限于控制与设计，缺乏优化形态与策略的共识方法
2. 方法要点：支持关节、手指和手掌生成的形态搜索空间，通过跨具身控制进行可扩展评估
3. 实验或效果：在模拟和真实部署中评估多任务，实现24小时内设计、训练、制造和部署新机器人手

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Dexterous manipulation is limited by both control and design, without consensus as to what makes manipulators best for performing dexterous tasks. This raises a fundamental challenge: how should we design and control robot manipulators that are optimized for dexterity? We present a co-design framework that learns task-specific hand morphology and complementary dexterous control policies. The framework supports 1) an expansive morphology search space including joint, finger, and palm generation, 2) scalable evaluation across the wide design space via morphology-conditioned cross-embodied control, and 3) real-world fabrication with accessible components. We evaluate the approach across multiple dexterous tasks, including in-hand rotation with simulation and real deployment. Our framework enables an end-to-end pipeline that can design, train, fabricate, and deploy a new robotic hand in under 24 hours. The full framework will be open-sourced and available on our website.
