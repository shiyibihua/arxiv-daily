## 💡 一句话要点

**提出SA-FARI数据集以解决野生动物多动物追踪基准缺失问题**

**关键词**: `多动物追踪` `野生动物数据集` `分割掩码` `物种识别` `基准测试` `计算机视觉`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 现有数据集规模小、物种少，缺乏时空多样性，无法训练通用多动物追踪模型
2. SA-FARI包含11,609个视频，覆盖99个物种，提供密集边界框、分割掩码和物种标注
3. 使用SAM 3等模型进行基准测试，评估物种特定和通用动物提示下的检测与追踪性能

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Automated video analysis is critical for wildlife conservation. A foundational task in this domain is multi-animal tracking (MAT), which underpins applications such as individual re-identification and behavior recognition. However, existing datasets are limited in scale, constrained to a few species, or lack sufficient temporal and geographical diversity - leaving no suitable benchmark for training general-purpose MAT models applicable across wild animal populations. To address this, we introduce SA-FARI, the largest open-source MAT dataset for wild animals. It comprises 11,609 camera trap videos collected over approximately 10 years (2014-2024) from 741 locations across 4 continents, spanning 99 species categories. Each video is exhaustively annotated culminating in ~46 hours of densely annotated footage containing 16,224 masklet identities and 942,702 individual bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and species labels. Alongside the task-specific annotations, we publish anonymized camera trap locations for each video. Finally, we present comprehensive benchmarks on SA-FARI using state-of-the-art vision-language models for detection and tracking, including SAM 3, evaluated with both species-specific and generic animal prompts. We also compare against vision-only methods developed specifically for wildlife analysis. SA-FARI is the first large-scale dataset to combine high species diversity, multi-region coverage, and high-quality spatio-temporal annotations, offering a new foundation for advancing generalizable multianimal tracking in the wild.
