**关键词**: `事件触发系统` `GMM背景建模` `SVM机器学习` `老年监护` `社交劝导` `危险检测`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：监测老年人身体与心理状态，提供危险警报和社交互动支持。
2. 方法要点：采用GMM背景建模检测访客和老人运动行为，SVM分析图像。
3. 实验或效果：在5个家庭场景中测试，检测看门狗、危险通知和照片链接事件。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> In the study, the physical state and mental state of elders are both considered, and an event-triggered system has developed to detect events: watch dog, danger notice and photo link. By adopting GMM background modeling, the motion behavior of visitors and elders can be detected in the watch dog event and danger notice event respectively. Experiments set in home scenarios and 5 families participated in the experiments for detecting and recording three types of events from their life activities. In addition, the captured images were analyzed using SVM machine learning. For lack of technical experiences of elders, an intuitive operation as normal life activity was designed to create communication between elder and relatives via social media.
