**提出SIGMMA框架以解决组织病理图像与空间转录组多尺度对齐问题**

**关键词**: `计算病理学` `多模态对齐` `图神经网络` `对比学习` `空间转录组学` `多尺度表示`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 现有方法在单尺度对齐HE图像与ST谱，忽略细胞结构层次
2. SIGMMA通过多尺度对比对齐和图结构建模细胞交互
3. 实验显示在基因预测和跨模态检索任务中性能显著提升

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Recent advances in computational pathology have leveraged vision-language models to learn joint representations of Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) images with spatial transcriptomic (ST) profiles. However, existing approaches typically align HE tiles with their corresponding ST profiles at a single scale, overlooking fine-grained cellular structures and their spatial organization. To address this, we propose Sigmma, a multi-modal contrastive alignment framework for learning hierarchical representations of HE images and spatial transcriptome profiles across multiple scales. Sigmma introduces multi-scale contrastive alignment, ensuring that representations learned at different scales remain coherent across modalities. Furthermore, by representing cell interactions as a graph and integrating inter- and intra-subgraph relationships, our approach effectively captures cell-cell interactions, ranging from fine to coarse, within the tissue microenvironment. We demonstrate that Sigmm learns representations that better capture cross-modal correspondences, leading to an improvement of avg. 9.78\% in the gene-expression prediction task and avg. 26.93\% in the cross-modal retrieval task across datasets. We further show that it learns meaningful multi-tissue organization in downstream analyses.
