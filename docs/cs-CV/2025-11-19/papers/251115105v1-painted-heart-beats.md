## 💡 一句话要点

**提出AURA框架，实现基于心率的机器人手臂与艺术家协同绘画。**

**关键词**: `人机协同绘画` `生物反馈控制` `机器人手臂` `情感计算` `艺术交互`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：如何使机器人手臂与人类艺术家在绘画中实现流畅协同。
2. 方法要点：使用EmotiBit传感器检测艺术家心率，机器人据此调整与画布的距离。
3. 实验或效果：机器人根据心率高低移动，心率高时远离画布区域，中性时继续绘画。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> In this work we present AURA, a framework for synergistic human-artist painting. We developed a robot arm that collaboratively paints with a human artist. The robot has an awareness of the artist's heartbeat through the EmotiBit sensor, which provides the arousal levels of the painter. Given the heartbeat detected, the robot decides to increase proximity to the artist's workspace or retract. If a higher heartbeat is detected, which is associated with increased arousal in human artists, the robot will move away from that area of the canvas. If the artist's heart rate is detected as neutral, indicating the human artist's baseline state, the robot will continue its painting actions across the entire canvas. We also demonstrate and propose alternative robot-artist interactions using natural language and physical touch. This work combines the biometrics of a human artist to inform fluent artistic interactions.
