## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The aim of this paper is to design a new type of grasping and perching
> unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), called Flexbee, which features a soft
> vector-propulsion nozzle (SVPN). Compared to previous UAVs, Flexbee integrates
> flight, grasping, and perching functionalities into the four SVPNs. This
> integration offers advantages including decoupled position and attitude
> control, high structural reuse, and strong adaptability strong adaptability for
> grasping and perching. A dynamics model of Flexbee has been developed, and the
> nonlinear coupling issue of the moment has been resolved through linearization
> of the equivalent moment model. A hierarchical control strategy was used to
> design controllers for the two operational modes of Flexbee. Finally, flight,
> grasping, and perching experiments were conducted to validate Flexbee's
> kinematic capabilities and the effectiveness of the control strategy.
