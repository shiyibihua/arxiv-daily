## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper addresses metric 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes by exploiting
> their inherent geometric regularities with compact representations. Using
> planar 3D primitives - a well-suited representation for man-made environments -
> we introduce PLANA3R, a pose-free framework for metric Planar 3D Reconstruction
> from unposed two-view images. Our approach employs Vision Transformers to
> extract a set of sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and
> supervise geometry learning via planar splatting, where gradients are
> propagated through high-resolution rendered depth and normal maps of
> primitives. Unlike prior feedforward methods that require 3D plane annotations
> during training, PLANA3R learns planar 3D structures without explicit plane
> supervision, enabling scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets using
> only depth and normal annotations. We validate PLANA3R on multiple indoor-scene
> datasets with metric supervision and demonstrate strong generalization to
> out-of-domain indoor environments across diverse tasks under metric evaluation
> protocols, including 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and relative
> pose estimation. Furthermore, by formulating with planar 3D representation, our
> method emerges with the ability for accurate plane segmentation. The project
