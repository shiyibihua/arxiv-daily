## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) can provide provable safety guarantees for
> dynamic systems. However, finding a valid CBF for a system of interest is often
> non-trivial, especially if the shape of the unsafe region is complex and the
> CBFs are of higher order. A common solution to this problem is to make a
> conservative approximation of the unsafe region in the form of a
> line/hyperplane, and use the corresponding conservative Hyperplane-CBF when
> deciding on safe control actions. In this letter, we note that conservative
> constraints are only a problem if they prevent us from doing what we want.
> Thus, instead of first choosing a CBF and then choosing a safe control with
> respect to the CBF, we optimize over a combination of CBFs and safe controls to
> get as close as possible to our desired control, while still having the safety
> guarantee provided by the CBF. We call the corresponding CBF the least
> restrictive Hyperplane-CBF. Finally, we also provide a way of creating a smooth
> parameterization of the CBF-family for the optimization, and illustrate the
> approach on a double integrator dynamical system with acceleration constraints,
> moving through a group of arbitrarily shaped static and moving obstacles.
