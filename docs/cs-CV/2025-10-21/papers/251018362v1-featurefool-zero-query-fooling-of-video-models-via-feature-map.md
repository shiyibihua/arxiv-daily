## 💡 一句话要点

**提出FeatureFool实现视频模型零查询黑盒攻击，利用特征图扰动特征空间**

**关键词**: `视频模型攻击` `零查询黑盒攻击` `特征图扰动` `对抗样本` `视频质量评估`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 视频模型黑盒攻击需多轮查询，不实用且难扩展至Video-LLMs
2. 利用DNN提取信息直接扰动干净视频特征空间，无需查询
3. 攻击成功率超70%，对抗视频质量高，可绕过Video-LLM识别

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been preliminarily
> verified. Existing black-box adversarial attacks usually require multi-round
> interaction with the model and consume numerous queries, which is impractical
> in the real-world and hard to scale to recently emerged Video-LLMs. Moreover,
> no attack in the video domain directly leverages feature maps to shift the
> clean-video feature space. We therefore propose FeatureFool, a stealthy,
> video-domain, zero-query black-box attack that utilizes information extracted
> from a DNN to alter the feature space of clean videos. Unlike query-based
> methods that rely on iterative interaction, FeatureFool performs a zero-query
> attack by directly exploiting DNN-extracted information. This efficient
> approach is unprecedented in the video domain. Experiments show that
> FeatureFool achieves an attack success rate above 70\% against traditional
> video classifiers without any queries. Benefiting from the transferability of
> the feature map, it can also craft harmful content and bypass Video-LLM
> recognition. Additionally, adversarial videos generated by FeatureFool exhibit
> high quality in terms of SSIM, PSNR, and Temporal-Inconsistency, making the
> attack barely perceptible. This paper may contain violent or explicit content.
