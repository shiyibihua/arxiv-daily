## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Multimodal dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small set of image-text
> pairs that enables efficient training of large-scale vision-language models.
> While dataset distillation has shown promise in unimodal tasks, extending it to
> multimodal contrastive learning presents key challenges: learning cross-modal
> alignment and managing the high computational cost of large encoders. Prior
> approaches address scalability by freezing the text encoder and update only the
> image encoder and text projection layer. However, we find this severely limits
> semantic alignment and becomes a bottleneck for performance scaling. We propose
> CovMatch, a scalable dataset distillation framework that aligns the
> cross-covariance of real and synthetic features while regularizing feature
> distributions within each modality. Unlike prior approaches, CovMatch enables
> joint optimization of both encoders, leading to stronger cross-modal alignment
> and improved performance. Evaluated on Flickr30K and COCO, CovMatch outperforms
> state-of-the-art multimodal distillation methods and achieves up to 6.8%
> absolute gains in retrieval accuracy using only 500 synthetic pairs.
