## 💡 一句话要点

**在活火山测试四足机器人自适应最优控制算法以验证行星探索应用**

**关键词**: `四足机器人` `行星探索` `自适应控制` `最优控制` `实地测试` `火山环境`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：轮式漫游车难以穿越行星崎岖地形，需开发腿式机器人提升探索能力。
2. 方法要点：开发自适应最优控制算法，优化四足机器人在复杂环境中的运动性能。
3. 实验或效果：在意大利Vulcano活火山进行实地测试，验证算法在月球和火星模拟环境中的有效性。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Missions such as the Ingenuity helicopter have shown the advantages of using
> novel locomotion modes to increase the scientific return of planetary
> exploration missions. Legged robots can further expand the reach and capability
> of future planetary missions by traversing more difficult terrain than wheeled
> rovers, such as jumping over cracks on the ground or traversing rugged terrain
> with boulders. To develop and test algorithms for using quadruped robots, the
> AAPLE project was carried out at DFKI. As part of the project, we conducted a
> series of field experiments on the Volcano on the Aeolian island of Vulcano, an
> active stratovolcano near Sicily, Italy. The experiments focused on validating
> newly developed state-of-the-art adaptive optimal control algorithms for
> quadrupedal locomotion in a high-fidelity analog environment for Lunar and
> Martian surfaces. This paper presents the technical approach, test plan,
> software architecture, field deployment strategy, and evaluation results from
> the Vulcano campaign.
