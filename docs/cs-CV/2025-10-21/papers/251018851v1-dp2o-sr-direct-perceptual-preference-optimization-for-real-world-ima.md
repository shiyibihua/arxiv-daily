## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Benefiting from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, real-world
> image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods can synthesize rich and realistic
> details. However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different
> noise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although
> this randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider
> perceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR
> performance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference
> Optimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative
> models with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations.
> We construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and
> no-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human
> preference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and
> natural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the
> standard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from
> outputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection
> ratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage,
> while larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision.
> Furthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively
> weights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group
> diversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments
> across both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR
> significantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world
> benchmarks.
