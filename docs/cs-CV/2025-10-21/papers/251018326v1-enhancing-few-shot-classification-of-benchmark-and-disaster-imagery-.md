## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The increasing frequency of natural and human-induced disasters necessitates
> advanced visual recognition techniques capable of analyzing critical
> photographic data. With progress in artificial intelligence and resilient
> computational systems, rapid and accurate disaster classification has become
> crucial for efficient rescue operations. However, visual recognition in
> disaster contexts faces significant challenges due to limited and diverse data
> from the difficulties in collecting and curating comprehensive, high-quality
> disaster imagery. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) provides a promising approach to data
> scarcity, yet current FSL research mainly relies on generic benchmark datasets
> lacking remote-sensing disaster imagery, limiting its practical effectiveness.
> Moreover, disaster images exhibit high intra-class variation and inter-class
> similarity, hindering the performance of conventional metric-based FSL methods.
> To address these issues, this paper introduces the Attention-based
> Bhattacharyya-Hellinger Feature Aggregation Network (ATTBHFA-Net), which
> linearly combines the Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distances to
> compare and aggregate feature probability distributions for robust prototype
> formation. The Bhattacharyya coefficient serves as a contrastive margin that
> enhances inter-class separability, while the Hellinger distance regularizes
> same-class alignment. This framework parallels contrastive learning but
> operates over probability distributions rather than embedded feature points.
> Furthermore, a Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distance-based contrastive loss is
> proposed as a distributional counterpart to cosine similarity loss, used
> jointly with categorical cross-entropy to significantly improve FSL
> performance. Experiments on four FSL benchmarks and two disaster image datasets
> demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalization of ATTBHFA-Net
> compared to existing approaches.
