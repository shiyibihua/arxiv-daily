## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Climate change is intensifying the occurrence of harmful algal bloom (HAB),
> particularly cyanobacteria, which threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health
> through oxygen depletion, toxin release, and disruption of marine biodiversity.
> Traditional monitoring approaches, such as manual water sampling, remain
> labor-intensive and limited in spatial and temporal coverage. Recent advances
> in vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing have shown potential for
> scalable AI-driven solutions, yet challenges remain in reasoning over imagery
> and quantifying bloom severity. In this work, we introduce ALGae Observation
> and Segmentation (ALGOS), a segmentation-and-reasoning system for HAB
> monitoring that combines remote sensing image understanding with severity
> estimation. Our approach integrates GeoSAM-assisted human evaluation for
> high-quality segmentation mask curation and fine-tunes vision language model on
> severity prediction using the Cyanobacteria Aggregated Manual Labels (CAML)
> from NASA. Experiments demonstrate that ALGOS achieves robust performance on
> both segmentation and severity-level estimation, paving the way toward
> practical and automated cyanobacterial monitoring systems.
