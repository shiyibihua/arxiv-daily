## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Image complexity assessment (ICA) is a challenging task in perceptual
> evaluation due to the subjective nature of human perception and the inherent
> semantic diversity in real-world images. Existing ICA methods predominantly
> rely on hand-crafted or shallow convolutional neural network-based features of
> a single visual modality, which are insufficient to fully capture the perceived
> representations closely related to image complexity. Recently, cross-modal
> scene semantic information has been shown to play a crucial role in various
> computer vision tasks, particularly those involving perceptual understanding.
> However, the exploration of cross-modal scene semantic information in the
> context of ICA remains unaddressed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a
> novel ICA method called Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment (CM-SSA), which
> leverages scene semantic alignment from a cross-modal perspective to enhance
> ICA performance, enabling complexity predictions to be more consistent with
> subjective human perception. Specifically, the proposed CM-SSA consists of a
> complexity regression branch and a scene semantic alignment branch. The
> complexity regression branch estimates image complexity levels under the
> guidance of the scene semantic alignment branch, while the scene semantic
> alignment branch is used to align images with corresponding text prompts that
> convey rich scene semantic information by pair-wise learning. Extensive
> experiments on several ICA datasets demonstrate that the proposed CM-SSA
> significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Codes are available at
> https://github.com/XQ2K/First-Cross-Model-ICA.
