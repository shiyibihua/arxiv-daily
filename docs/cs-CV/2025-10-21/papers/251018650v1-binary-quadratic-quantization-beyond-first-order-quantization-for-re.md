## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper proposes a novel matrix quantization method, Binary Quadratic
> Quantization (BQQ). In contrast to conventional first-order quantization
> approaches, such as uniform quantization and binary coding quantization, that
> approximate real-valued matrices via linear combinations of binary bases, BQQ
> leverages the expressive power of binary quadratic expressions while
> maintaining an extremely compact data format. We validate our approach with two
> experiments: a matrix compression benchmark and post-training quantization
> (PTQ) on pretrained Vision Transformer-based models. Experimental results
> demonstrate that BQQ consistently achieves a superior trade-off between memory
> efficiency and reconstruction error than conventional methods for compressing
> diverse matrix data. It also delivers strong PTQ performance, even though we
> neither target state-of-the-art PTQ accuracy under tight memory constraints nor
> rely on PTQ-specific binary matrix optimization. For example, our proposed
> method outperforms the state-of-the-art PTQ method by up to 2.2\% and 59.1% on
> the ImageNet dataset under the calibration-based and data-free scenarios,
> respectively, with quantization equivalent to 2 bits. These findings highlight
> the surprising effectiveness of binary quadratic expressions for efficient
> matrix approximation and neural network compression.
