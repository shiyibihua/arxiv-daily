## 💡 一句话要点

**提出3DThinker框架，通过几何想象从有限视图进行3D空间推理。**

**关键词**: `3D空间推理` `几何想象` `多模态学习` `视觉语言模型` `有限视图理解`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有方法在有限视图下理解3D空间关系能力不足。
2. 方法要点：无需3D先验输入，通过两阶段训练对齐3D潜在表示。
3. 实验或效果：在多个基准测试中优于基线，统一3D表示于多模态推理。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Though recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved
> remarkable progress across a wide range of multimodal tasks, understanding 3D
> spatial relationships from limited views remains a significant challenge.
> Previous reasoning methods typically rely on pure text (e.g., topological
> cognitive maps) or on 2D visual cues. However, their limited representational
> capacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial
> imagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that
> can effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images
> while reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D
> mentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on
> explicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of
> two stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent
> generated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g.,
> VGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on
> outcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive
> experiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently
> outperforms strong baselines and offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D
> representations into multimodal reasoning. Our code will be available at
> https://github.com/zhangquanchen/3DThinker.
