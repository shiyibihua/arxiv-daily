## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph
> representation learning due to their ability to model diverse node
> interactions. However, existing GTs often rely on intricate architectural
> designs tailored to specific interactions, limiting their flexibility. To
> address this, we propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that reveals an
> underlying equivalence between model architecture and attention mask
> construction. This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by
> capturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks.
> Theoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of
> correct classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and
> label consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective
> attention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a
> high level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies this
> principle across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masks
> offer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration. Then, we
> introduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Graph Transformer with
> Multi-Level Masking and Dual Attention Computation. M3Dphormer incorporates
> three theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and employs a bi-level expert
> routing mechanism to adaptively integrate multi-level interaction information.
> To ensure scalability, we further introduce a dual attention computation scheme
> that dynamically switches between dense and sparse modes based on local mask
> sparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
> M3Dphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness
> of our unified framework and model design.
