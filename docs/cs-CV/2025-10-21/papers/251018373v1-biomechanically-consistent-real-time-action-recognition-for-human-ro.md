## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper presents a novel framework for real-time human action recognition
> in industrial contexts, using standard 2D cameras. We introduce a complete
> pipeline for robust and real-time estimation of human joint kinematics, input
> to a temporally smoothed Transformer-based network, for action recognition. We
> rely on a new dataset including 11 subjects performing various actions, to
> evaluate our approach. Unlike most of the literature that relies on joint
> center positions (JCP) and is offline, ours uses biomechanical prior, eg. joint
> angles, for fast and robust real-time recognition. Besides, joint angles make
> the proposed method agnostic to sensor and subject poses as well as to
> anthropometric differences, and ensure robustness across environments and
> subjects. Our proposed learning model outperforms the best baseline model,
> running also in real-time, along various metrics. It achieves 88% accuracy and
> shows great generalization ability, for subjects not facing the cameras.
> Finally, we demonstrate the robustness and usefulness of our technique, through
> an online interaction experiment, with a simulated robot controlled in
> real-time via the recognized actions.
