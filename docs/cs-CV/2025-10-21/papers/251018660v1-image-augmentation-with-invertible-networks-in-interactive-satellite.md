## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper devises a novel interactive satellite image change detection
> algorithm based on active learning. Our framework employs an iterative process
> that leverages a question-and-answer model. This model queries the oracle
> (user) about the labels of a small subset of images (dubbed as display), and
> based on the oracle's responses, change detection model is dynamically updated.
> The main contribution of our framework resides in a novel invertible network
> that allows augmenting displays, by mapping them from highly nonlinear input
> spaces to latent ones, where augmentation transformations become linear and
> more tractable. The resulting augmented data are afterwards mapped back to the
> input space, and used to retrain more effective change detection criteria in
> the subsequent iterations of active learning. Experimental results demonstrate
> superior performance of our proposed method compared to the related work.
