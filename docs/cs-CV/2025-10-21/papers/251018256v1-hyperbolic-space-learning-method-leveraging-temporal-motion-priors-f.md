## 📄 摘要（原文）

> 3D human meshes show a natural hierarchical structure (like
> torso-limbs-fingers). But existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods
> usually learn mesh features in Euclidean space. It's hard to catch this
> hierarchical structure accurately. So wrong human meshes are reconstructed. To
> solve this problem, we propose a hyperbolic space learning method leveraging
> temporal motion prior for recovering 3D human meshes from videos. First, we
> design a temporal motion prior extraction module. This module extracts the
> temporal motion features from the input 3D pose sequences and image feature
> sequences respectively. Then it combines them into the temporal motion prior.
> In this way, it can strengthen the ability to express features in the temporal
> motion dimension. Since data representation in non-Euclidean space has been
> proved to effectively capture hierarchical relationships in real-world datasets
> (especially in hyperbolic space), we further design a hyperbolic space
> optimization learning strategy. This strategy uses the temporal motion prior
> information to assist learning, and uses 3D pose and pose motion information
> respectively in the hyperbolic space to optimize and learn the mesh features.
> Then, we combine the optimized results to get an accurate and smooth human
> mesh. Besides, to make the optimization learning process of human meshes in
> hyperbolic space stable and effective, we propose a hyperbolic mesh
> optimization loss. Extensive experimental results on large publicly available
> datasets indicate superiority in comparison with most state-of-the-art.
