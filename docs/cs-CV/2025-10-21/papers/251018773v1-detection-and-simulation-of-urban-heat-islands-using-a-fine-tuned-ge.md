## 📄 摘要（原文）

> As urbanization and climate change progress, urban heat island effects are
> becoming more frequent and severe. To formulate effective mitigation plans,
> cities require detailed air temperature data, yet conventional machine learning
> models with limited data often produce inaccurate predictions, particularly in
> underserved areas. Geospatial foundation models trained on global unstructured
> data offer a promising alternative by demonstrating strong generalization and
> requiring only minimal fine-tuning. In this study, an empirical ground truth of
> urban heat patterns is established by quantifying cooling effects from green
> spaces and benchmarking them against model predictions to evaluate the model's
> accuracy. The foundation model is subsequently fine-tuned to predict land
> surface temperatures under future climate scenarios, and its practical value is
> demonstrated through a simulated inpainting that highlights its role for
> mitigation support. The results indicate that foundation models offer a
> powerful way for evaluating urban heat island mitigation strategies in
> data-scarce regions to support more climate-resilient cities.
