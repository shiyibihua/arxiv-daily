## 💡 一句话要点

**提出自适应运动策略以优化四足机器人在行星斜坡上的行走与滑动选择**

**关键词**: `四足机器人` `行星探索` `运动策略` `运输成本` `物理仿真`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：传统腿式运动在松散倾斜地形上能效低且危险
2. 方法要点：比较行走与滑动运输成本，定义策略转换阈值
3. 实验或效果：结合Isaac Sim和ANSYS-Rocky仿真验证初步结果

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Legged rovers provide enhanced mobility compared to wheeled platforms,
> enabling navigation on steep and irregular planetary terrains. However,
> traditional legged locomotion might be energetically inefficient and
> potentially dangerous to the rover on loose and inclined surfaces, such as
> crater walls and cave slopes. This paper introduces a preliminary study that
> compares the Cost of Transport (CoT) of walking and torso-based sliding
> locomotion for quadruped robots across different slopes, friction conditions
> and speed levels. By identifying intersections between walking and sliding CoT
> curves, we aim to define threshold conditions that may trigger transitions
> between the two strategies. The methodology combines physics-based simulations
> in Isaac Sim with particle interaction validation in ANSYS-Rocky. Our results
> represent an initial step towards adaptive locomotion strategies for planetary
> legged rovers.
