## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Subject-driven image generation models face a fundamental trade-off between
> identity preservation (fidelity) and prompt adherence (editability). While
> online reinforcement learning (RL), specifically GPRO, offers a promising
> solution, we find that a naive application of GRPO leads to competitive
> degradation, as the simple linear aggregation of rewards with static weights
> causes conflicting gradient signals and a misalignment with the temporal
> dynamics of the diffusion process. To overcome these limitations, we propose
> Customized-GRPO, a novel framework featuring two key innovations: (i)
> Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping (SARS), a non-linear mechanism that explicitly
> penalizes conflicted reward signals and amplifies synergistic ones, providing a
> sharper and more decisive gradient. (ii) Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting (TDW),
> which aligns the optimization pressure with the model's temporal dynamics by
> prioritizing prompt-following in the early, identity preservation in the later.
> Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
> naive GRPO baselines, successfully mitigating competitive degradation. Our
> model achieves a superior balance, generating images that both preserve key
> identity features and accurately adhere to complex textual prompts.
