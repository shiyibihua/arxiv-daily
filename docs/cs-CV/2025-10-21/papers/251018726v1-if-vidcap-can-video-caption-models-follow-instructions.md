## 💡 一句话要点

**提出IF-VidCap基准以评估可控视频描述中的指令遵循能力**

**关键词**: `可控视频描述` `指令遵循基准` `多模态大语言模型` `格式正确性` `内容正确性`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 当前视频描述基准忽视指令遵循，专注于描述全面性
2. 引入IF-VidCap基准，评估格式和内容正确性，含1400样本
3. 评估20+模型显示专有模型领先，开源模型接近，密集描述模型表现不佳

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
> proficiency in video captioning, practical applications require captions that
> follow specific user instructions rather than generating exhaustive,
> unconstrained descriptions. Current benchmarks, however, primarily assess
> descriptive comprehensiveness while largely overlooking instruction-following
> capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce IF-VidCap, a new benchmark for
> evaluating controllable video captioning, which contains 1,400 high-quality
> samples. Distinct from existing video captioning or general
> instruction-following benchmarks, IF-VidCap incorporates a systematic framework
> that assesses captions on two dimensions: format correctness and content
> correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation of over 20 prominent models reveals a
> nuanced landscape: despite the continued dominance of proprietary models, the
> performance gap is closing, with top-tier open-source solutions now achieving
> near-parity. Furthermore, we find that models specialized for dense captioning
> underperform general-purpose MLLMs on complex instructions, indicating that
> future work should simultaneously advance both descriptive richness and
> instruction-following fidelity.
