## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability offers a framework for generating safe
> value functions and policies in the face of adversarial disturbance, but is
> limited by the curse of dimensionality. Physics-informed deep learning is able
> to overcome this infeasibility, but itself suffers from slow and inaccurate
> convergence, primarily due to weak PDE gradients and the complexity of
> self-supervised learning. A few works, recently, have demonstrated that
> enriching the self-supervision process with regular supervision (based on the
> nature of the optimal control problem), greatly accelerates convergence and
> solution quality, however, these have been limited to single player problems
> and simple games. In this work, we introduce MADR: MPC-guided Adversarial
> DeepReach, a general framework to robustly approximate the two-player, zero-sum
> differential game value function. In doing so, MADR yields the corresponding
> optimal strategies for both players in zero-sum games as well as safe policies
> for worst-case robustness. We test MADR on a multitude of high-dimensional
> simulated and real robotic agents with varying dynamics and games, finding that
> our approach significantly out-performs state-of-the-art baselines in
> simulation and produces impressive results in hardware.
