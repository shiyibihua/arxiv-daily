## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Integrating visual-language instructions into visuomotor policies is gaining
> momentum in robot learning for enhancing open-world generalization. Despite
> promising advances, existing approaches face two challenges: limited language
> steerability when no generated reasoning is used as a condition, or significant
> inference latency when reasoning is incorporated.In this work, we introduce
> MoTVLA, a mixture-of-transformers (MoT)-based vision-language-action (VLA)
> model that integrates fast-slow unified reasoning with behavior policy
> learning. MoTVLA preserves the general intelligence of pre-trained VLMs
> (serving as the generalist) for tasks such as perception, scene understanding,
> and semantic planning, while incorporating a domain expert, a second
> transformer that shares knowledge with the pretrained VLM, to generate
> domain-specific fast reasoning (e.g., robot motion decomposition), thereby
> improving policy execution efficiency. By conditioning the action expert on
> decomposed motion instructions, MoTVLA can learn diverse behaviors and
> substantially improve language steerability. Extensive evaluations across
> natural language processing benchmarks, robotic simulation environments, and
> real-world experiments confirm the superiority of MoTVLA in both fast-slow
> reasoning and manipulation task performance.
