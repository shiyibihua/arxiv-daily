## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) requires models to effectively utilize
> both visual and auditory modalities to answer complex and diverse questions
> about audio-visual scenes. However, existing methods lack sufficient
> flexibility and dynamic adaptability in temporal sampling and modality
> preference awareness, making it difficult to focus on key information based on
> the question. This limits their reasoning capability in complex scenarios. To
> address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named AV-Master. It
> enhances the model's ability to extract key information from complex
> audio-visual scenes with substantial redundant content by dynamically modeling
> both temporal and modality dimensions. In the temporal dimension, we introduce
> a dynamic adaptive focus sampling mechanism that progressively focuses on
> audio-visual segments most relevant to the question, effectively mitigating
> redundancy and segment fragmentation in traditional sampling methods. In the
> modality dimension, we propose a preference-aware strategy that models each
> modality's contribution independently, enabling selective activation of
> critical features. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-path contrastive loss to
> reinforce consistency and complementarity across temporal and modality
> dimensions, guiding the model to learn question-specific cross-modal
> collaborative representations. Experiments on four large-scale benchmarks show
> that AV-Master significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in
> complex reasoning tasks.
