## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Tuberculosis remains a critical global health issue, particularly in
> resource-limited and remote areas. Early detection is vital for treatment, yet
> the lack of skilled radiologists underscores the need for artificial
> intelligence (AI)-driven screening tools. Developing reliable AI models is
> challenging due to the necessity for large, high-quality datasets, which are
> costly to obtain. To tackle this, we propose a teacher--student framework which
> enhances both disease and symptom detection on chest X-rays by integrating two
> supervised heads and a self-supervised head. Our model achieves an accuracy of
> 98.85% for distinguishing between COVID-19, tuberculosis, and normal cases, and
> a macro-F1 score of 90.09% for multilabel symptom detection, significantly
> outperforming baselines. The explainability assessments also show the model
> bases its predictions on relevant anatomical features, demonstrating promise
> for deployment in clinical screening and triage settings.
