## 💡 一句话要点

**提出UWBench基准以评估水下环境中的视觉语言理解能力**

**关键词**: `水下视觉语言理解` `基准数据集` `图像标注` `视觉问答` `海洋生态监测`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：水下图像存在光衰减、颜色失真等挑战，且缺乏专门基准。
2. 方法要点：构建包含15003张图像、标注和问答对的数据集，支持多种任务。
3. 实验或效果：测试先进模型显示水下理解仍有改进空间，促进海洋应用。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Large vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
> natural scene understanding, yet their application to underwater environments
> remains largely unexplored. Underwater imagery presents unique challenges
> including severe light attenuation, color distortion, and suspended particle
> scattering, while requiring specialized knowledge of marine ecosystems and
> organism taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we introduce UWBench, a comprehensive
> benchmark specifically designed for underwater vision-language understanding.
> UWBench comprises 15,003 high-resolution underwater images captured across
> diverse aquatic environments, encompassing oceans, coral reefs, and deep-sea
> habitats. Each image is enriched with human-verified annotations including
> 15,281 object referring expressions that precisely describe marine organisms
> and underwater structures, and 124,983 question-answer pairs covering diverse
> reasoning capabilities from object recognition to ecological relationship
> understanding. The dataset captures rich variations in visibility, lighting
> conditions, and water turbidity, providing a realistic testbed for model
> evaluation. Based on UWBench, we establish three comprehensive benchmarks:
> detailed image captioning for generating ecologically informed scene
> descriptions, visual grounding for precise localization of marine organisms,
> and visual question answering for multimodal reasoning about underwater
> environments. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate that
> underwater understanding remains challenging, with substantial room for
> improvement. Our benchmark provides essential resources for advancing
> vision-language research in underwater contexts and supporting applications in
> marine science, ecological monitoring, and autonomous underwater exploration.
> Our code and benchmark will be available.
