## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The vast majority of cardiovascular diseases may be preventable if early
> signs and risk factors are detected. Cardiovascular monitoring with body-worn
> sensor devices like sensor patches allows for the detection of such signs while
> preserving the freedom and comfort of patients. However, the analysis of the
> sensor data must be robust, reliable, efficient, and highly accurate. Deep
> learning methods can automate data interpretation, reducing the workload of
> clinicians. In this work, we analyze the feasibility of applying deep learning
> models to the classification of synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG) and
> phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings on resource-constrained medical edge devices.
> We propose a convolutional neural network with early fusion of data to solve a
> binary classification problem. We train and validate our model on the
> synchronized ECG and PCG recordings from the Physionet Challenge 2016 dataset.
> Our approach reduces memory footprint and compute cost by three orders of
> magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art while maintaining competitive
> accuracy. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed model on medical
> edge devices by analyzing energy consumption on a microcontroller and an
> experimental sensor device setup, confirming that on-device inference can be
> more energy-efficient than continuous data streaming.
