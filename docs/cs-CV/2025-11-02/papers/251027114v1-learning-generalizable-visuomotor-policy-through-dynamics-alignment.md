## 💡 一句话要点

**提出动态对齐流匹配策略以提升机器人视觉运动策略的泛化能力**

**关键词**: `机器人学习` `行为克隆` `动态预测` `策略学习` `泛化能力` `视觉运动策略`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 行为克隆方法泛化性差，受限于专家演示数据不足
2. 集成动态预测与策略学习，通过相互反馈实现自校正
3. 在真实机器人操作任务中，泛化性能优于基线，对视觉干扰和光照变化鲁棒

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Behavior cloning methods for robot learning suffer from poor generalization
> due to limited data support beyond expert demonstrations. Recent approaches
> leveraging video prediction models have shown promising results by learning
> rich spatiotemporal representations from large-scale datasets. However, these
> models learn action-agnostic dynamics that cannot distinguish between different
> control inputs, limiting their utility for precise manipulation tasks and
> requiring large pretraining datasets. We propose a Dynamics-Aligned Flow
> Matching Policy (DAP) that integrates dynamics prediction into policy learning.
> Our method introduces a novel architecture where policy and dynamics models
> provide mutual corrective feedback during action generation, enabling
> self-correction and improved generalization. Empirical validation demonstrates
> generalization performance superior to baseline methods on real-world robotic
> manipulation tasks, showing particular robustness in OOD scenarios including
> visual distractions and lighting variations.
