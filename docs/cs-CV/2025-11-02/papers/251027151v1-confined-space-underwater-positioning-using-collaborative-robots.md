## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Positioning of underwater robots in confined and cluttered spaces remains a
> key challenge for field operations. Existing systems are mostly designed for
> large, open-water environments and struggle in industrial settings due to poor
> coverage, reliance on external infrastructure, and the need for feature-rich
> surroundings. Multipath effects from continuous sound reflections further
> degrade signal quality, reducing accuracy and reliability. Accurate and easily
> deployable positioning is essential for repeatable autonomous missions;
> however, this requirement has created a technological bottleneck limiting
> underwater robotic deployment. This paper presents the Collaborative Aquatic
> Positioning (CAP) system, which integrates collaborative robotics and sensor
> fusion to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the "mother-ship" concept,
> the surface vehicle acts as a mobile leader to assist in positioning a
> submerged robot, enabling localization even in GPS-denied and highly
> constrained environments. The system is validated in a large test tank through
> repeatable autonomous missions using CAP's position estimates for real-time
> trajectory control. Experimental results demonstrate a mean Euclidean distance
> (MED) error of 70 mm, achieved in real time without requiring fixed
> infrastructure, extensive calibration, or environmental features. CAP leverages
> advances in mobile robot sensing and leader-follower control to deliver a step
> change in accurate, practical, and infrastructure-free underwater localization.
