## 💡 一句话要点

**提出SilhouetteTell利用字幕轮廓时空特征进行视频识别攻击**

**关键词**: `视频识别攻击` `字幕轮廓分析` `时空特征` `隐私威胁` `智能手机实验`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 视频识别攻击威胁隐私，可泄露观看历史导致歧视或勒索
2. 基于字幕轮廓的空间和时间信息构建时空特征，匹配字幕文件
3. 实验在智能手机上验证，可远程40米内推断视频标题和片段

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Video identification attacks pose a significant privacy threat that can
> reveal videos that victims watch, which may disclose their hobbies, religious
> beliefs, political leanings, sexual orientation, and health status. Also, video
> watching history can be used for user profiling or advertising and may result
> in cyberbullying, discrimination, or blackmail. Existing extensive video
> inference techniques usually depend on analyzing network traffic generated by
> streaming online videos. In this work, we observe that the content of a
> subtitle determines its silhouette displayed on the screen, and identifying
> each subtitle silhouette also derives the temporal difference between two
> consecutive subtitles. We then propose SilhouetteTell, a novel video
> identification attack that combines the spatial and time domain information
> into a spatiotemporal feature of subtitle silhouettes. SilhouetteTell explores
> the spatiotemporal correlation between recorded subtitle silhouettes of a video
> and its subtitle file. It can infer both online and offline videos.
> Comprehensive experiments on off-the-shelf smartphones confirm the high
> efficacy of SilhouetteTell for inferring video titles and clips under various
> settings, including from a distance of up to 40 meters.
