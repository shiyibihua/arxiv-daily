## 💡 一句话要点

**提出高斯组合距离以解决小物体检测中IoU和Wasserstein距离的不足**

**关键词**: `物体检测` `相似性度量` `边界框回归` `小物体检测` `高斯分布` `损失函数`

## 📋 核心要点

1. IoU对小物体位置偏差敏感，Wasserstein距离缺乏尺度不变性且优化缓慢
2. GCD具有尺度不变性，支持联合优化，提升模型定位性能
3. 在AI-TOD-v2、MS-COCO-2017和Visdrone-2019数据集上实现SOTA性能

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> In object detection, a well-defined similarity metric can significantly
> enhance model performance. Currently, the IoU-based similarity metric is the
> most commonly preferred choice for detectors. However, detectors using IoU as a
> similarity metric often perform poorly when detecting small objects because of
> their sensitivity to minor positional deviations. To address this issue, recent
> studies have proposed the Wasserstein Distance as an alternative to IoU for
> measuring the similarity of Gaussian-distributed bounding boxes. However, we
> have observed that the Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance, which
> negatively impacts the model's generalization capability. Additionally, when
> used as a loss function, its independent optimization of the center attributes
> leads to slow model convergence and unsatisfactory detection precision. To
> address these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD).
> Through analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD
> not only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization,
> which enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the
> AI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box
> regression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art
> performance across various detectors. We further validated the generalizability
> of GCD on the MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets, where it outperforms the
> Wasserstein Distance across diverse scales of datasets. Code is available at
