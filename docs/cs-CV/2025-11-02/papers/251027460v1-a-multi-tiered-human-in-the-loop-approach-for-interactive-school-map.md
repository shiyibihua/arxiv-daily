## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper presents a multi-tiered human-in-the-loop framework for
> interactive school mapping designed to improve the accuracy and completeness of
> educational facility records, particularly in developing regions where such
> data may be scarce and infrequently updated. The first tier involves a machine
> learning based analysis of population density, land cover, and existing
> infrastructure compared with known school locations. The first tier identifies
> potential gaps and "mislabelled" schools. In subsequent tiers,
> medium-resolution satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) is investigated to pinpoint
> regions with a high likelihood of school presence, followed by the application
> of very high-resolution (VHR) imagery and deep learning models to generate
> detailed candidate locations for schools within these prioritised areas. The
> medium-resolution approach was later removed due to insignificant improvements.
> The medium and VHR resolution models build upon global pre-trained steps to
> improve generalisation. A key component of the proposed approach is an
> interactive interface to allow human operators to iteratively review, validate,
> and refine the mapping results. Preliminary evaluations indicate that the
> multi-tiered strategy provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for
> educational infrastructure mapping to support planning and resource allocation.
