## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Implicit policies parameterized by generative models, such as Diffusion
> Policy, have become the standard for policy learning and Vision-Language-Action
> (VLA) models in robotics. However, these approaches often suffer from high
> computational cost, exposure bias, and unstable inference dynamics, which lead
> to divergence under distribution shifts. Energy-Based Models (EBMs) address
> these issues by learning energy landscapes end-to-end and modeling equilibrium
> dynamics, offering improved robustness and reduced exposure bias. Yet, policies
> parameterized by EBMs have historically struggled to scale effectively. Recent
> work on Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) demonstrates the scalability of EBMs
> to high-dimensional spaces, but their potential for solving core challenges in
> physically embodied models remains underexplored. We introduce a new
> energy-based architecture, EBT-Policy, that solves core issues in robotic and
> real-world settings. Across simulated and real-world tasks, EBT-Policy
> consistently outperforms diffusion-based policies, while requiring less
> training and inference computation. Remarkably, on some tasks it converges
> within just two inference steps, a 50x reduction compared to Diffusion Policy's
> 100. Moreover, EBT-Policy exhibits emergent capabilities not seen in prior
> models, such as zero-shot recovery from failed action sequences using only
> behavior cloning and without explicit retry training. By leveraging its scalar
> energy for uncertainty-aware inference and dynamic compute allocation,
> EBT-Policy offers a promising path toward robust, generalizable robot behavior
> under distribution shifts.
