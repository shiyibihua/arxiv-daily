## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Early detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) is critical for reducing
> mortality and improving patient treatment planning. While angiographic image
> analysis from X-rays is a common and cost-effective method for identifying
> cardiac abnormalities, including stenotic coronary arteries, poor image quality
> can significantly impede clinical diagnosis. We present the Coronary Artery
> Segmentation and Refinement Network (CASR-Net), a three-stage pipeline
> comprising image preprocessing, segmentation, and refinement. A novel
> multichannel preprocessing strategy combining CLAHE and an improved Ben Graham
> method provides incremental gains, increasing Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) by
> 0.31-0.89% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by 0.40-1.16% compared with using
> the techniques individually. The core innovation is a segmentation network
> built on a UNet with a DenseNet121 encoder and a Self-organized Operational
> Neural Network (Self-ONN) based decoder, which preserves the continuity of
> narrow and stenotic vessel branches. A final contour refinement module further
> suppresses false positives. Evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation on a
> combination of two public datasets that contain both healthy and stenotic
> arteries, CASR-Net outperformed several state-of-the-art models, achieving an
> IoU of 61.43%, a DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36%. These results highlight a
> robust approach to automated coronary artery segmentation, offering a valuable
> tool to support clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning.
