## 📄 摘要（原文）

> In this paper a modular and scalable architecture for heterogeneous
> swarm-based Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UASs) built on PX4-Autopilot and
> Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) framework is presented. The proposed
> architecture emphasizes seamless integration of hardware components by
> introducing independent ROS 2 nodes for each component of a Unmanned Aerial
> Vehicle (UAV). Communication between swarm participants is abstracted in
> software, allowing the use of various technologies without architectural
> changes. Key functionalities are supported, e.g. leader following and formation
> flight to maneuver the swarm. The system also allows computer vision algorithms
> to be integrated for the detection and tracking of UAVs. Additionally, a ground
> station control is integrated for the coordination of swarm operations.
> Swarm-based Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) architecture is verified within a
> Gazebo simulation environment but also in real-world demonstrations.
