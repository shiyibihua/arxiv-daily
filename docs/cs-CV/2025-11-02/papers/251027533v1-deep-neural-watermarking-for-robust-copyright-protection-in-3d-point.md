## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The protection of intellectual property has become critical due to the rapid
> growth of three-dimensional content in digital media. Unlike traditional images
> or videos, 3D point clouds present unique challenges for copyright enforcement,
> as they are especially vulnerable to a range of geometric and non-geometric
> attacks that can easily degrade or remove conventional watermark signals. In
> this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a robust deep neural
> watermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection and ownership
> verification. Our approach embeds binary watermarks into the singular values of
> 3D point cloud blocks using spectral decomposition, i.e. Singular Value
> Decomposition (SVD), and leverages the extraction capabilities of Deep Learning
> using PointNet++ neural network architecture. The network is trained to
> reliably extract watermarks even after the data undergoes various attacks such
> as rotation, scaling, noise, cropping and signal distortions. We validated our
> method using the publicly available ModelNet40 dataset, demonstrating that deep
> learning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD-based
> techniques under challenging conditions. Our experimental evaluation
> demonstrates that the deep learning-based extraction approach significantly
> outperforms existing SVD-based methods with deep learning achieving bitwise
> accuracy up to 0.83 and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, compared to SVD
> achieving a bitwise accuracy of 0.58 and IoU of 0.26 for the Crop (70%) attack,
> which is the most severe geometric distortion in our experiment. This
> demonstrates our method's ability to achieve superior watermark recovery and
> maintain high fidelity even under severe distortions.
