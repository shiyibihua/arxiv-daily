## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Surgical reconstruction of dynamic tissues from endoscopic videos is a
> crucial technology in robot-assisted surgery. The development of Neural
> Radiance Fields (NeRFs) has greatly advanced deformable tissue reconstruction,
> achieving high-quality results from video and image sequences. However,
> reconstructing deformable endoscopic scenes remains challenging due to aliasing
> and artifacts caused by tissue movement, which can significantly degrade
> visualization quality. The introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has
> improved reconstruction efficiency by enabling a faster rendering pipeline.
> Nevertheless, existing 3DGS methods often prioritize rendering speed while
> neglecting these critical issues. To address these challenges, we propose SAGS,
> a self-adaptive alias-free Gaussian splatting framework. We introduce an
> attention-driven, dynamically weighted 4D deformation decoder, leveraging 3D
> smoothing filters and 2D Mip filters to mitigate artifacts in deformable tissue
> reconstruction and better capture the fine details of tissue movement.
> Experimental results on two public benchmarks, EndoNeRF and SCARED, demonstrate
> that our method achieves superior performance in all metrics of PSNR, SSIM, and
> LPIPS compared to the state of the art while also delivering better
> visualization quality.
