## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Eliminating geometric distortion in semantically important regions remains an
> intractable challenge in image retargeting. This paper presents Object-IR, a
> self-supervised architecture that reformulates image retargeting as a
> learning-based mesh warping optimization problem, where the mesh deformation is
> guided by object appearance consistency and geometric-preserving constraints.
> Given an input image and a target aspect ratio, we initialize a uniform rigid
> mesh at the output resolution and use a convolutional neural network to predict
> the motion of each mesh grid and obtain the deformed mesh. The retargeted
> result is generated by warping the input image according to the rigid mesh in
> the input image and the deformed mesh in the output resolution. To mitigate
> geometric distortion, we design a comprehensive objective function
> incorporating a) object-consistent loss to ensure that the important semantic
> objects retain their appearance, b) geometric-preserving loss to constrain
> simple scale transform of the important meshes, and c) boundary loss to enforce
> a clean rectangular output. Notably, our self-supervised paradigm eliminates
> the need for manually annotated retargeting datasets by deriving supervision
> directly from the input's geometric and semantic properties. Extensive
> evaluations on the RetargetMe benchmark demonstrate that our Object-IR achieves
> state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in quantitative
> metrics and subjective visual quality assessments. The framework efficiently
> processes arbitrary input resolutions (average inference time: 0.009s for
> 1024x683 resolution) while maintaining real-time performance on consumer-grade
> GPUs. The source code will soon be available at
> https://github.com/tlliao/Object-IR.
