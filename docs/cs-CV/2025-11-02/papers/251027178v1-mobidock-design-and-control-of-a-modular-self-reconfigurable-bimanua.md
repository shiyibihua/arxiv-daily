## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Multi-robot systems, particularly mobile manipulators, face challenges in
> control coordination and dynamic stability when working together. To address
> this issue, this study proposes MobiDock, a modular self-reconfigurable mobile
> manipulator system that allows two independent robots to physically connect and
> form a unified mobile bimanual platform. This process helps transform a complex
> multi-robot control problem into the management of a simpler, single system.
> The system utilizes an autonomous docking strategy based on computer vision
> with AprilTag markers and a new threaded screw-lock mechanism. Experimental
> results show that the docked configuration demonstrates better performance in
> dynamic stability and operational efficiency compared to two independently
> cooperating robots. Specifically, the unified system has lower Root Mean Square
> (RMS) Acceleration and Jerk values, higher angular precision, and completes
> tasks significantly faster. These findings confirm that physical
> reconfiguration is a powerful design principle that simplifies cooperative
> control, improving stability and performance for complex tasks in real-world
> environments.
