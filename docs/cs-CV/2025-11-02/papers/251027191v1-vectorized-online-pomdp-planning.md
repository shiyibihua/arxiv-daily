## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Planning under partial observability is an essential capability of autonomous
> robots. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) provides a
> powerful framework for planning under partial observability problems, capturing
> the stochastic effects of actions and the limited information available through
> noisy observations. POMDP solving could benefit tremendously from massive
> parallelization of today's hardware, but parallelizing POMDP solvers has been
> challenging. They rely on interleaving numerical optimization over actions with
> the estimation of their values, which creates dependencies and synchronization
> bottlenecks between parallel processes that can quickly offset the benefits of
> parallelization. In this paper, we propose Vectorized Online POMDP Planner
> (VOPP), a novel parallel online solver that leverages a recent POMDP
> formulation that analytically solves part of the optimization component,
> leaving only the estimation of expectations for numerical computation. VOPP
> represents all data structures related to planning as a collection of tensors
> and implements all planning steps as fully vectorized computations over this
> representation. The result is a massively parallel solver with no dependencies
> and synchronization bottlenecks between parallel computations. Experimental
> results indicate that VOPP is at least 20X more efficient in computing
> near-optimal solutions compared to an existing state-of-the-art parallel online
> solver.
