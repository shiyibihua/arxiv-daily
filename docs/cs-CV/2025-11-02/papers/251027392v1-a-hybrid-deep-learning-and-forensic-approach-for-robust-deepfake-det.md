**关键词**: `深度伪造检测` `混合框架` `法证特征` `深度学习` `鲁棒性` `可解释性`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：生成对抗网络和扩散模型使合成媒体更逼真，现有检测方法泛化差或对新攻击有限。
2. 方法要点：结合噪声残差、JPEG压缩痕迹等法证特征与CNN和ViT的深度学习表示。
3. 实验或效果：在多个数据集上F1分数达0.96、0.82和0.77，鲁棒性测试显示压缩和扰动下性能稳定。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The rapid evolution of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion
> models has made synthetic media increasingly realistic, raising societal
> concerns around misinformation, identity fraud, and digital trust. Existing
> deepfake detection methods either rely on deep learning, which suffers from
> poor generalization and vulnerability to distortions, or forensic analysis,
> which is interpretable but limited against new manipulation techniques. This
> study proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features, including noise
> residuals, JPEG compression traces, and frequency-domain descriptors, with deep
> learning representations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision
> transformers (ViTs). Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF
> v2, DFDC), the proposed model consistently outperformed single-method baselines
> and demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
> hybrid approaches, achieving F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77, respectively.
> Robustness tests demonstrated stable performance under compression (F1 = 0.87
> at QF = 50), adversarial perturbations (AUC = 0.84), and unseen manipulations
> (F1 = 0.79). Importantly, explainability analysis showed that Grad-CAM and
> forensic heatmaps overlapped with ground-truth manipulated regions in 82
> percent of cases, enhancing transparency and user trust. These findings confirm
> that hybrid approaches provide a balanced solution, combining the adaptability
> of deep models with the interpretability of forensic cues, to develop resilient
> and trustworthy deepfake detection systems.
