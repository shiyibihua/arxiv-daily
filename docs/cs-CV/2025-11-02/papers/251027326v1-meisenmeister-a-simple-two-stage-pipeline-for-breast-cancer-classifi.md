## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The ODELIA Breast MRI Challenge 2025 addresses a critical issue in breast
> cancer screening: improving early detection through more efficient and accurate
> interpretation of breast MRI scans. Even though methods for general-purpose
> whole-body lesion segmentation as well as multi-time-point analysis exist,
> breast cancer detection remains highly challenging, largely due to the limited
> availability of high-quality segmentation labels. Therefore, developing robust
> classification-based approaches is crucial for the future of early breast
> cancer detection, particularly in applications such as large-scale screening.
> In this write-up, we provide a comprehensive overview of our approach to the
> challenge. We begin by detailing the underlying concept and foundational
> assumptions that guided our work. We then describe the iterative development
> process, highlighting the key stages of experimentation, evaluation, and
> refinement that shaped the evolution of our solution. Finally, we present the
> reasoning and evidence that informed the design choices behind our final
> submission, with a focus on performance, robustness, and clinical relevance. We
> release our full implementation publicly at
