## 💡 一句话要点

**提出HyperClick框架，通过不确定性校准提升GUI自动化中的可靠定位。**

**关键词**: `GUI定位` `不确定性校准` `强化微调` `置信建模` `自动化代理`

## 📋 核心要点

1. GUI代理在语言指令到屏幕坐标的定位中缺乏能力边界意识，导致过度自信和不可靠预测。
2. 引入双奖励机制，结合二元奖励和高斯空间置信建模，使用Brier分数进行校准。
3. 在七个挑战基准上实现最优性能，提供良好校准的置信度，减少过度自信。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Autonomous Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents rely on accurate GUI
> grounding, which maps language instructions to on-screen coordinates, to
> execute user commands. However, current models, whether trained via supervised
> fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), lack self-awareness of
> their capability boundaries, leading to overconfidence and unreliable
> predictions. We first systematically evaluate probabilistic and verbalized
> confidence in general and GUI-specific models, revealing a misalignment between
> confidence and actual accuracy, which is particularly critical in dynamic GUI
> automation tasks, where single errors can cause task failure. To address this,
> we propose HyperClick, a novel framework that enhances reliable GUI grounding
> through uncertainty calibration. HyperClick introduces a dual reward mechanism,
> combining a binary reward for correct actions with a truncated Gaussian-based
> spatial confidence modeling, calibrated using the Brier score. This approach
> jointly optimizes grounding accuracy and confidence reliability, fostering
> introspective self-criticism. Extensive experiments on seven challenge
> benchmarks show that HyperClick achieves state-of-the-art performance while
> providing well-calibrated confidence. By enabling explicit confidence
> calibration and introspective self-criticism, HyperClick reduces overconfidence
> and supports more reliable GUI automation.
