## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Medical images play a crucial role in assisting diagnosis, remote
> consultation, and academic research. However, during the transmission and
> sharing process, they face serious risks of copyright ownership and content
> tampering. Therefore, protecting medical images is of great importance. As an
> effective means of image copyright protection, zero-watermarking technology
> focuses on constructing watermarks without modifying the original carrier by
> extracting its stable features, which provides an ideal approach for protecting
> medical images. This paper aims to propose a fragile zero-watermarking model
> based on dual quaternion matrix decomposition, which utilizes the operational
> relationship between the standard part and the dual part of dual quaternions to
> correlate the original carrier image with the watermark image, and generates
> zero-watermarking information based on the characteristics of dual quaternion
> matrix decomposition, ultimately achieving copyright protection and content
> tampering detection for medical images.
