## 💡 一句话要点

**提出模块化软体抓取器，通过全身形态重构实现跨尺度鲁棒抓取**

**关键词**: `软体机器人` `模块化抓取器` `形态重构` `跨尺度抓取` `自感知执行器` `气动驱动`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 传统软体抓取器形态固定，难以实现生物般的全身自适应重构
2. 采用分布式自感知气动执行器网络，实现可控多边形形态重构
3. 实验验证可抓取多样几何与尺度物体，并支持多对象和内部钩抓

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Biological systems, such as the octopus, exhibit masterful cross-scale
> manipulation by adaptively reconfiguring their entire form, a capability that
> remains elusive in robotics. Conventional soft grippers, while compliant, are
> mostly constrained by a fixed global morphology, and prior shape-morphing
> efforts have been largely confined to localized deformations, failing to
> replicate this biological dexterity. Inspired by this natural exemplar, we
> introduce the paradigm of collaborative, whole-body proprioceptive morphing,
> realized in a modular soft gripper architecture. Our design is a distributed
> network of modular self-sensing pneumatic actuators that enables the gripper to
> intelligently reconfigure its entire topology, achieving multiple morphing
> states that are controllable to form diverse polygonal shapes. By integrating
> rich proprioceptive feedback from embedded sensors, our system can seamlessly
> transition from a precise pinch to a large envelope grasp. We experimentally
> demonstrate that this approach expands the grasping envelope and enhances
> generalization across diverse object geometries (standard and irregular) and
> scales (up to 10$\times$), while also unlocking novel manipulation modalities
> such as multi-object and internal hook grasping. This work presents a low-cost,
> easy-to-fabricate, and scalable framework that fuses distributed actuation with
> integrated sensing, offering a new pathway toward achieving biological levels
> of dexterity in robotic manipulation.
