## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We propose a novel continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) framework for
> simultaneously learning diverse features from multi-window-obtained chest
> computed tomography (CT) images and ensuring data privacy. Achieving a robust
> and highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging,
> mainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately
> annotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare
> environments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from
> differences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical
> purposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past
> data, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our
> approach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship
> between previously learned knowledge and new information across different
> training stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images.
> Specifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our
> method mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual
> pretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature
> distillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge
> distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of
> the model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations. Finally, we
> validate our approach using chest CT images obtained across two different
> window settings, demonstrating superior performance compared with other
> approaches.
