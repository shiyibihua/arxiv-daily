## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We consider the problem of ultra-low bit rate visual communication for remote
> vision analysis, human interactions and control in challenging scenarios with
> very low communication bandwidth, such as deep space exploration, battlefield
> intelligence, and robot navigation in complex environments. In this paper, we
> ask the following important question: can we accurately reconstruct the visual
> scene using only a very small portion of the bit rate in existing coding
> methods while not sacrificing the accuracy of vision analysis and performance
> of human interactions? Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new
> approach for ultra-low bitrate image description. However, they can only
> achieve a semantic-level approximation of the visual scene, which is far
> insufficient for the purpose of visual communication and remote vision analysis
> and human interactions. To address this important issue, we propose to
> seamlessly integrate image generation with deep image compression, using joint
> text and coding latent to guide the rectified flow models for precise
> generation of the visual scene. The semantic text description and coding latent
> are both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate.
> Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the same image
> reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while
> using much less bandwidth. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.
