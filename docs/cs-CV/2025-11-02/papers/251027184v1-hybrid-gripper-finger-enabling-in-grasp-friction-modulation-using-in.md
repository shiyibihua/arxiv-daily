## 💡 一句话要点

**提出混合夹爪手指通过充气硅胶袋调节摩擦以安全抓取多样物体**

**关键词**: `机器人夹爪` `摩擦调节` `软体机器人` `物体抓取` `充气结构`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：传统夹爪依赖高法向力易损坏物体，难以抓取重、滑或易碎物品。
2. 方法要点：结合刚性外壳与软性充气硅胶袋，通过气压控制主动调节表面摩擦。
3. 实验或效果：增加气压提升摩擦系数，稳定抓取重滑物体并减少对易碎物品损伤。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Grasping objects with diverse mechanical properties, such as heavy, slippery,
> or fragile items, remains a significant challenge in robotics. Conventional
> grippers often rely on applying high normal forces, which can cause damage to
> objects. To address this limitation, we present a hybrid gripper finger that
> combines a rigid structural shell with a soft, inflatable silicone pocket. The
> gripper finger can actively modulate its surface friction by controlling the
> internal air pressure of the silicone pocket. Results from fundamental
> experiments indicate that increasing the internal pressure results in a
> proportional increase in the effective coefficient of friction. This enables
> the gripper to stably lift heavy and slippery objects without increasing the
> gripping force and to handle fragile or deformable objects, such as eggs,
> fruits, and paper cups, with minimal damage by increasing friction rather than
> applying excessive force. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid
> gripper finger with adaptable friction provides a robust and safer alternative
> to relying solely on high normal forces, thereby enhancing the gripper
> flexibility in handling delicate, fragile, and diverse objects.
