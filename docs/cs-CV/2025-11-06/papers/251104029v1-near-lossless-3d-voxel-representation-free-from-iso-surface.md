## 💡 一句话要点

**提出Faithful Contouring以解决3D网格表示中的几何保真度问题**

**关键词**: `3D体素表示` `几何保真度` `稀疏表示` `形状重建` `等值面自由`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 现有基于等值面的体素表示依赖水密化或渲染优化，损害几何保真度
2. Faithful Contouring为稀疏体素表示，无需场函数转换或等值面提取，支持高分辨率
3. 实验显示在表示和重建中精度与效率领先，距离误差达10^-5级，Chamfer距离减少93%

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Accurate and efficient voxelized representations of 3D meshes are the
> foundation of 3D reconstruction and generation. However, existing
> representations based on iso-surface heavily rely on water-tightening or
> rendering optimization, which inevitably compromise geometric fidelity. We
> propose Faithful Contouring, a sparse voxelized representation that supports
> 2048+ resolutions for arbitrary meshes, requiring neither converting meshes to
> field functions nor extracting the isosurface during remeshing. It achieves
> near-lossless fidelity by preserving sharpness and internal structures, even
> for challenging cases with complex geometry and topology. The proposed method
> also shows flexibility for texturing, manipulation, and editing. Beyond
> representation, we design a dual-mode autoencoder for Faithful Contouring,
> enabling scalable and detail-preserving shape reconstruction. Extensive
> experiments show that Faithful Contouring surpasses existing methods in
> accuracy and efficiency for both representation and reconstruction. For direct
> representation, it achieves distance errors at the $10^{-5}$ level; for mesh
> reconstruction, it yields a 93\% reduction in Chamfer Distance and a 35\%
> improvement in F-score over strong baselines, confirming superior fidelity as a
> representation for 3D learning tasks.
