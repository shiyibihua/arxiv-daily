## 💡 一句话要点

**提出基于扩散模型的免训练框架，实现文本到草图的精确多风格生成。**

**关键词**: `草图生成` `扩散模型` `风格控制` `免训练框架` `多风格合成`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 现有方法缺乏对草图风格的精确控制机制，导致合成质量受限。
2. 采用参考特征辅助和风格-内容引导，减少内容泄漏并提升合成质量。
3. 实验显示该方法在风格对齐和灵活性方面优于现有方法。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Recent advances in vision-language models have facilitated progress in sketch
> generation. However, existing specialized methods primarily focus on generic
> synthesis and lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles. In this
> work, we propose a training-free framework based on diffusion models that
> enables explicit style guidance via textual prompts and referenced style
> sketches. Unlike previous style transfer methods that overwrite key and value
> matrices in self-attention, we incorporate the reference features as auxiliary
> information with linear smoothing and leverage a style-content guidance
> mechanism. This design effectively reduces content leakage from reference
> sketches and enhances synthesis quality, especially in cases with low
> structural similarity between reference and target sketches. Furthermore, we
> extend our framework to support controllable multi-style generation by
> integrating features from multiple reference sketches, coordinated via a joint
> AdaIN module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
> high-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and improved
> flexibility in style control. The official implementation of M3S is available
> at https://github.com/CMACH508/M3S.
