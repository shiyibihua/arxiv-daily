## 💡 一句话要点

**提出FastGS以加速3D高斯溅射训练，基于多视图一致性优化高斯数量**

**关键词**: `3D高斯溅射` `训练加速` `多视图一致性` `高斯优化` `场景重建`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有3D高斯溅射加速方法未有效调控高斯数量，导致计算冗余。
2. 方法要点：设计基于多视图一致性的高斯致密化和剪枝策略，无需预算机制。
3. 实验效果：在多个数据集上实现2-7倍训练加速，渲染质量可比。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The dominant 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods fail to
> properly regulate the number of Gaussians during training, causing redundant
> computational time overhead. In this paper, we propose FastGS, a novel, simple,
> and general acceleration framework that fully considers the importance of each
> Gaussian based on multi-view consistency, efficiently solving the trade-off
> between training time and rendering quality. We innovatively design a
> densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, dispensing
> with the budgeting mechanism. Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks &
> Temples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
> outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in training speed, achieving a
> 3.32$\times$ training acceleration and comparable rendering quality compared
> with DashGaussian on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset and a 15.45$\times$ acceleration
> compared with vanilla 3DGS on the Deep Blending dataset. We demonstrate that
> FastGS exhibits strong generality, delivering 2-7$\times$ training acceleration
> across various tasks, including dynamic scene reconstruction, surface
> reconstruction, sparse-view reconstruction, large-scale reconstruction, and
> simultaneous localization and mapping. The project page is available at
