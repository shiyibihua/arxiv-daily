## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Jigsaw puzzle solving requires the rearrangement of unordered pieces into
> their original pose in order to reconstruct a coherent whole, often an image,
> and is known to be an intractable problem. While the possible impact of
> automatic puzzle solvers can be disruptive in various application domains, most
> of the literature has focused on developing solvers for square jigsaw puzzles,
> severely limiting their practical use. In this work, we significantly expand
> the types of puzzles handled computationally, focusing on what is known as
> Convex Partitions, a major subset of polygonal puzzles whose pieces are convex.
> We utilize both geometrical and pictorial compatibilities, introduce a greedy
> solver, and report several performance measures next to the first benchmark
> dataset of such puzzles.
