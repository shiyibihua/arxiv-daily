## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Efficiently leveraging simulation to acquire advanced manipulation skills is
> both challenging and highly significant. We introduce \textit{ForeRobo}, a
> generative robotic agent that utilizes generative simulations to autonomously
> acquire manipulation skills driven by envisioned goal states. Instead of
> directly learning low-level policies, we advocate integrating generative
> paradigms with classical control. Our approach equips a robotic agent with a
> self-guided \textit{propose-generate-learn-actuate} cycle. The agent first
> proposes the skills to be acquired and constructs the corresponding simulation
> environments; it then configures objects into appropriate arrangements to
> generate skill-consistent goal states (\textit{ForeGen}). Subsequently, the
> virtually infinite data produced by ForeGen are used to train the proposed
> state generation model (\textit{ForeFormer}), which establishes point-wise
> correspondences by predicting the 3D goal position of every point in the
> current state, based on the scene state and task instructions. Finally,
> classical control algorithms are employed to drive the robot in real-world
> environments to execute actions based on the envisioned goal states. Compared
> with end-to-end policy learning methods, ForeFormer offers superior
> interpretability and execution efficiency. We train and benchmark ForeFormer
> across a variety of rigid-body and articulated-object manipulation tasks, and
> observe an average improvement of 56.32\% over the state-of-the-art state
> generation models, demonstrating strong generality across different
> manipulation patterns. Moreover, in real-world evaluations involving more than
> 20 robotic tasks, ForeRobo achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and exhibits
> remarkable generalization capabilities, attaining an average success rate of
> 79.28\%.
