## 💡 一句话要点

**提出结合协方差描述符与通用视觉编码器，提升医学图像分类性能**

**关键词**: `协方差描述符` `通用视觉编码器` `SPDNet` `医学图像分类` `Riemannian深度学习`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：协方差描述符在医学图像中应用不足，需验证其有效性。
2. 方法要点：从预训练GVE提取特征构建协方差描述符，并评估SPDNet分类网络。
3. 实验或效果：在MedMNSIT基准测试中，GVE协方差描述符优于手工特征，SPDNet结合DINOv2表现最佳。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Covariance descriptors capture second-order statistics of image features.
> They have shown strong performance in general computer vision tasks, but remain
> underexplored in medical imaging. We investigate their effectiveness for both
> conventional and learning-based medical image classification, with a particular
> focus on SPDNet, a classification network specifically designed for symmetric
> positive definite (SPD) matrices. We propose constructing covariance
> descriptors from features extracted by pre-trained general vision encoders
> (GVEs) and comparing them with handcrafted descriptors. Two GVEs - DINOv2 and
> MedSAM - are evaluated across eleven binary and multi-class datasets from the
> MedMNSIT benchmark. Our results show that covariance descriptors derived from
> GVE features consistently outperform those derived from handcrafted features.
> Moreover, SPDNet yields superior performance to state-of-the-art methods when
> combined with DINOv2 features. Our findings highlight the potential of
> combining covariance descriptors with powerful pretrained vision encoders for
> medical image analysis.
