## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Herbicide field trials require accurate identification of plant species and
> assessment of herbicide-induced damage across diverse environments. While
> general-purpose vision foundation models have shown promising results in
> complex visual domains, their performance can be limited in agriculture, where
> fine-grained distinctions between species and damage types are critical.
>   In this work, we adapt a general-purpose vision foundation model to herbicide
> trial characterization. Trained using a self-supervised learning approach on a
> large, curated agricultural dataset, the model learns rich and transferable
> representations optimized for herbicide trials images.
>   Our domain-specific model significantly outperforms the best general-purpose
> foundation model in both species identification (F1 score improvement from 0.91
> to 0.94) and damage classification (from 0.26 to 0.33). Under unseen conditions
> (new locations and other time), it achieves even greater gains (species
> identification from 0.56 to 0.66; damage classification from 0.17 to 0.27). In
> domain-shift scenarios, such as drone imagery, it maintains strong performance
> (species classification from 0.49 to 0.60).
>   Additionally, we show that domain-specific pretraining enhances segmentation
> accuracy, particularly in low-annotation regimes. An annotation-efficiency
> analysis reveals that, under unseen conditions, the domain-specific model
> achieves 5.4% higher F1 score than the general-purpose model, while using 80%
> fewer labeled samples.
>   These results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of domain-specific
> foundation models and their potential to significantly reduce manual annotation
> efforts, offering a scalable and automated solution for herbicide trial
> analysis.
