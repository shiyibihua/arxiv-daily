## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The performance of vision models in medical imaging is often hindered by the
> prevailing paradigm of fine-tuning backbones pre-trained on out-of-domain
> natural images. To address this fundamental domain gap, we propose MedDChest, a
> new foundational Vision Transformer (ViT) model optimized specifically for
> thoracic imaging. We pre-trained MedDChest from scratch on a massive, curated,
> multimodal dataset of over 1.2 million images, encompassing different
> modalities including Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) compiled from 10
> public sources. A core technical contribution of our work is Guided Random
> Resized Crops, a novel content-aware data augmentation strategy that biases
> sampling towards anatomically relevant regions, overcoming the inefficiency of
> standard cropping techniques on medical scans. We validate our model's
> effectiveness by fine-tuning it on a diverse set of downstream diagnostic
> tasks. Comprehensive experiments empirically demonstrate that MedDChest
> significantly outperforms strong, publicly available ImageNet-pretrained
> models. By establishing the superiority of large-scale, in-domain pre-training
> combined with domain-specific data augmentation, MedDChest provides a powerful
> and robust feature extractor that serves as a significantly better starting
> point for a wide array of thoracic diagnostic tasks. The model weights will be
> made publicly available to foster future research and applications.
