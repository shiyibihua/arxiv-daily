## 💡 一句话要点

**提出'视频思维'范式，利用视频生成模型统一多模态推理。**

**关键词**: `视频生成` `多模态推理` `Sora-2模型` `VideoThinkBench` `自一致性学习`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 图像和文本分离范式无法表示动态过程，限制多模态理解与生成。
2. 引入视频生成模型如Sora-2，在统一时序框架中桥接视觉与文本推理。
3. 在VideoThinkBench评估中，Sora-2在视觉和文本任务中表现优异，支持自一致性和上下文学习。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> "Thinking with Text" and "Thinking with Images" paradigm significantly
> improve the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) and Vision
> Language Models (VLMs). However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1)
> Images capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or
> continuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct
> modalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To
> overcome these limitations, we introduce "Thinking with Video", a new paradigm
> that leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and
> textual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration,
> we developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench
> encompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing
> Puzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our
> evaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks,
> Sora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even
> surpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric
> tasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU.
> Furthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also
> find that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's
> performance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation
> model is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model,
> positions "thinking with video" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.
