## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Landslides cause severe damage to lives, infrastructure, and the environment,
> making accurate and timely mapping essential for disaster preparedness and
> response. However, conventional deep learning models often struggle when
> applied across different sensors, regions, or under conditions of limited
> training data. To address these challenges, we present a three-axis analytical
> framework of sensor, label, and domain for adapting geospatial foundation
> models (GeoFMs), focusing on Prithvi-EO-2.0 for landslide mapping. Through a
> series of experiments, we show that it consistently outperforms task-specific
> CNNs (U-Net, U-Net++), vision transformers (Segformer, SwinV2-B), and other
> GeoFMs (TerraMind, SatMAE). The model, built on global pretraining,
> self-supervision, and adaptable fine-tuning, proved resilient to spectral
> variation, maintained accuracy under label scarcity, and generalized more
> reliably across diverse datasets and geographic settings. Alongside these
> strengths, we also highlight remaining challenges such as computational cost
> and the limited availability of reusable AI-ready training data for landslide
> research. Overall, our study positions GeoFMs as a step toward more robust and
> scalable approaches for landslide risk reduction and environmental monitoring.
