## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Medical image segmentation is critical for accurate diagnostics and treatment
> planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures and
> limited annotated training data. CNN-based segmentation methods excel at local
> feature extraction, but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
> Transformers, on the other hand, capture global context more effectively, but
> are inherently data-hungry and computationally expensive. In this work, we
> introduce UKAST, a U-Net like architecture that integrates rational-function
> based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders. By
> leveraging rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from the
> Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), our architecture addresses the
> inefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs, yielding a more expressive and
> data-efficient framework with reduced FLOPs and only a very small increase in
> parameter count compared to SwinUNETR. UKAST achieves state-of-the-art
> performance on four diverse 2D and 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks,
> consistently surpassing both CNN- and Transformer-based baselines. Notably, it
> attains superior accuracy in data-scarce settings, alleviating the data-hungry
> limitations of standard Vision Transformers. These results show the potential
> of KAN-enhanced Transformers to advance data-efficient medical image
> segmentation. Code is available at: https://github.com/nsapkota417/UKAST
