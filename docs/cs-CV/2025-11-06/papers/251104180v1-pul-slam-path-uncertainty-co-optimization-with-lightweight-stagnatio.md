## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Existing Active SLAM methodologies face issues such as slow exploration speed
> and suboptimal paths. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid
> framework combining a Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization Deep Reinforcement
> Learning framework and a Lightweight Stagnation Detection mechanism. The
> Path-Uncertainty Co-Optimization framework jointly optimizes travel distance
> and map uncertainty through a dual-objective reward function, balancing
> exploration and exploitation. The Lightweight Stagnation Detection reduces
> redundant exploration through Lidar Static Anomaly Detection and Map Update
> Stagnation Detection, terminating episodes on low expansion rates. Experimental
> results show that compared with the frontier-based method and RRT method, our
> approach shortens exploration time by up to 65% and reduces path distance by up
> to 42%, significantly improving exploration efficiency in complex environments
> while maintaining reliable map completeness. Ablation studies confirm that the
> collaborative mechanism accelerates training convergence. Empirical validation
> on a physical robotic platform demonstrates the algorithm's practical
> applicability and its successful transferability from simulation to real-world
> environments.
