## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Understanding the current capabilities and risks of AI Scientist systems is
> essential for ensuring trustworthy and sustainable AI-driven scientific
> progress while preserving the integrity of the academic ecosystem. To this end,
> we develop Jr. AI Scientist, a state-of-the-art autonomous AI scientist system
> that mimics the core research workflow of a novice student researcher: Given
> the baseline paper from the human mentor, it analyzes its limitations,
> formulates novel hypotheses for improvement, validates them through rigorous
> experimentation, and writes a paper with the results. Unlike previous
> approaches that assume full automation or operate on small-scale code, Jr. AI
> Scientist follows a well-defined research workflow and leverages modern coding
> agents to handle complex, multi-file implementations, leading to scientifically
> valuable contributions. For evaluation, we conducted automated assessments
> using AI Reviewers, author-led evaluations, and submissions to Agents4Science,
> a venue dedicated to AI-driven scientific contributions. The findings
> demonstrate that Jr. AI Scientist generates papers receiving higher review
> scores than existing fully automated systems. Nevertheless, we identify
> important limitations from both the author evaluation and the Agents4Science
> reviews, indicating the potential risks of directly applying current AI
> Scientist systems and key challenges for future research. Finally, we
> comprehensively report various risks identified during development. We hope
> these insights will deepen understanding of current progress and risks in AI
> Scientist development.
