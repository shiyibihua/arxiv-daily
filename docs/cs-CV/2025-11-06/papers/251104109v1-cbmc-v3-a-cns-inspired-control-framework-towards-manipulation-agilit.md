## 📄 摘要（原文）

> As robotic arm applications extend beyond industrial settings into
> healthcare, service, and daily life, existing control algorithms struggle to
> achieve the agile manipulation required for complex environments with dynamic
> trajectories, unpredictable interactions, and diverse objects. This paper
> presents a biomimetic control framework based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN),
> inspired by the human Central Nervous System (CNS), to achieve agile control in
> such environments. The proposed framework features five control modules
> (cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem, spinal cord), three
> hierarchical control levels (first-order, second-order, third-order), and two
> information pathways (ascending, descending). Each module is fully implemented
> using SNN. The spinal cord module uses spike encoding and Leaky
> Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons for feedback control. The brainstem module
> employs a network of LIF and non-spiking LIF neurons to dynamically adjust
> spinal cord parameters via reinforcement learning. The thalamus module
> similarly adjusts the cerebellum's torque outputs. The cerebellum module uses a
> recurrent SNN to learn the robotic arm's dynamics through regression, providing
> feedforward gravity compensation torques. The framework is validated both in
> simulation and on real-world robotic arm platform under various loads and
> trajectories. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms the
> industrial-grade position control in manipulation agility.
