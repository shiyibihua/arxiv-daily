## 💡 一句话要点

**提出回归与分类等价性理论，用于估计回归难度和训练神经网络线性化映射。**

**关键词**: `回归分类等价性` `margin最大化` `可回归性度量` `神经网络线性化` `支持向量回归`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：回归与分类间缺乏形式等价性，传统方法中margin项仅作为正则化。
2. 方法要点：证明回归问题与线性可分分类任务等价，基于此推导新回归公式和可回归性度量。
3. 实验或效果：应用等价性训练神经网络学习线性化映射，无需先学习模型即可估计回归难度。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> A formal link between regression and classification has been tenuous. Even
> though the margin maximization term $\\|w\\|$ is used in support vector
> regression, it has at best been justified as a regularizer. We show that a
> regression problem with $M$ samples lying on a hyperplane has a one-to-one
> equivalence with a linearly separable classification task with $2M$ samples. We
> show that margin maximization on the equivalent classification task leads to a
> different regression formulation than traditionally used. Using the
> equivalence, we demonstrate a ``regressability'' measure, that can be used to
> estimate the difficulty of regressing a dataset, without needing to first learn
> a model for it. We use the equivalence to train neural networks to learn a
> linearizing map, that transforms input variables into a space where a linear
> regressor is adequate.
