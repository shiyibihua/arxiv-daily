**关键词**: `尾坐式无人机` `可重构机翼` `同轴双旋翼` `无斜盘机制` `垂直起降` `飞行控制`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 尾坐式无人机多旋翼模式易受风扰，因机身正面面积大。
2. 采用可重构机翼、同轴异构双旋翼和无斜盘机制，优化结构减重降功耗。
3. 通过过渡飞行测试验证全包线稳定飞行性能。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The tailsitter vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) UAV is widely used due to
> its lower dead weight, which eliminates the actuators and mechanisms for
> tilting. However, the tailsitter UAV is susceptible to wind disturbances in
> multi-rotor mode, as it exposes a large frontal fuselage area. To address this
> issue, our tailsitter UAV features a reconfigurable wing design, allowing wings
> to retract in multi-rotor mode and extend in fixed- wing mode. Considering
> power efficiency, we design a coaxial heterogeneous dual-rotor configuration,
> which significantly re- duces the total power consumption. To reduce structural
> weight and simplify structural complexity, we employ a swashplateless mechanism
> with an improved design to control pitch and roll in multi-rotor mode. We
> optimize the structure of the swashplateless mechanism by adding flapping
> hinges, which reduces vibration during cyclic acceleration and deceleration.
> Finally, we perform comprehensive transition flight tests to validate stable
> flight performance across the entire flight envelope of the tailsitter UAV.
