## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Robotic manipulation policies are advancing rapidly, but their direct
> evaluation in the real world remains costly, time-consuming, and difficult to
> reproduce, particularly for tasks involving deformable objects. Simulation
> provides a scalable and systematic alternative, yet existing simulators often
> fail to capture the coupled visual and physical complexity of soft-body
> interactions. We present a real-to-sim policy evaluation framework that
> constructs soft-body digital twins from real-world videos and renders robots,
> objects, and environments with photorealistic fidelity using 3D Gaussian
> Splatting. We validate our approach on representative deformable manipulation
> tasks, including plush toy packing, rope routing, and T-block pushing,
> demonstrating that simulated rollouts correlate strongly with real-world
> execution performance and reveal key behavioral patterns of learned policies.
> Our results suggest that combining physics-informed reconstruction with
> high-quality rendering enables reproducible, scalable, and accurate evaluation
> of robotic manipulation policies. Website: https://real2sim-eval.github.io/
