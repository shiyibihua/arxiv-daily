## 💡 一句话要点

**提出统一共享自治框架，通过高层抽象整合人类输入与自主规划以解决自动驾驶在罕见场景中的脆弱性问题。**

**关键词**: `共享自治` `自动驾驶` `视觉语言模型` `意图推断` `语义仲裁` `基准测试`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：自动驾驶在罕见、模糊和分布外场景中脆弱，而人类能通过上下文推理成功处理。
2. 方法要点：利用视觉语言模型从多模态线索推断驾驶意图，并在语义层面仲裁人类与自主控制。
3. 实验或效果：在Bench2Drive基准测试中，显著降低碰撞率并提升整体性能，人类调查显示92%参与者同意仲裁结果。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Autonomous driving systems remain brittle in rare, ambiguous, and
> out-of-distribution scenarios, where human driver succeed through contextual
> reasoning. Shared autonomy has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate such
> failures by incorporating human input when autonomy is uncertain. However, most
> existing methods restrict arbitration to low-level trajectories, which
> represent only geometric paths and therefore fail to preserve the underlying
> driving intent. We propose a unified shared autonomy framework that integrates
> human input and autonomous planners at a higher level of abstraction. Our
> method leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to infer driver intent from
> multi-modal cues -- such as driver actions and environmental context -- and to
> synthesize coherent strategies that mediate between human and autonomous
> control. We first study the framework in a mock-human setting, where it
> achieves perfect recall alongside high accuracy and precision. A human-subject
> survey further shows strong alignment, with participants agreeing with
> arbitration outcomes in 92% of cases. Finally, evaluation on the Bench2Drive
> benchmark demonstrates a substantial reduction in collision rate and
> improvement in overall performance compared to pure autonomy. Arbitration at
> the level of semantic, language-based representations emerges as a design
> principle for shared autonomy, enabling systems to exercise common-sense
> reasoning and maintain continuity with human intent.
