## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Human motion style transfer allows characters to appear less rigidity and
> more realism with specific style. Traditional arbitrary image style transfer
> typically process mean and variance which is proved effective. Meanwhile,
> similar methods have been adapted for motion style transfer. However, due to
> the fundamental differences between images and motion, relying on mean and
> variance is insufficient to fully capture the complex dynamic patterns and
> spatiotemporal coherence properties of motion data. Building upon this, our key
> insight is to bring two more coefficient, skewness and kurtosis, into the
> analysis of motion style. Specifically, we propose a novel Adaptive Statistics
> Fusor (AStF) which consists of Style Disentanglement Module (SDM) and
> High-Order Multi-Statistics Attention (HOS-Attn). We trained our AStF in
> conjunction with a Motion Consistency Regularization (MCR) discriminator.
> Experimental results show that, by providing a more comprehensive model of the
> spatiotemporal statistical patterns inherent in dynamic styles, our proposed
> AStF shows proficiency superiority in motion style transfers over
> state-of-the-arts. Our code and model are available at
> https://github.com/CHMimilanlan/AStF.
