## 💡 一句话要点

**提出上肢姿态优化方法以增强双手人机协作中的人体工学和力操纵性**

**关键词**: `上肢姿态优化` `人机协作` `人体工学` `力操纵性` `模型预测控制` `阻抗控制`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有研究多关注安全或效率，缺乏在多变条件下整合两者的方法
2. 方法要点：优化简化人体模型关节角度，最小化成本函数以优先安全和操纵能力

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper introduces an upper limb postural optimization method for
> enhancing physical ergonomics and force manipulability during bimanual
> human-robot co-carrying tasks. Existing research typically emphasizes human
> safety or manipulative efficiency, whereas our proposed method uniquely
> integrates both aspects to strengthen collaboration across diverse conditions
> (e.g., different grasping postures of humans, and different shapes of objects).
> Specifically, the joint angles of a simplified human skeleton model are
> optimized by minimizing the cost function to prioritize safety and manipulative
> capability. To guide humans towards the optimized posture, the reference
> end-effector poses of the robot are generated through a transformation module.
> A bimanual model predictive impedance controller (MPIC) is proposed for our
> human-like robot, CURI, to recalibrate the end effector poses through planned
> trajectories. The proposed method has been validated through various subjects
> and objects during human-human collaboration (HHC) and human-robot
> collaboration (HRC). The experimental results demonstrate significant
> improvement in muscle conditions by comparing the activation of target muscles
> before and after optimization.
