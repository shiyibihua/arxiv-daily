## 💡 一句话要点

**提出Room Envelopes合成数据集以支持室内布局重建研究**

**关键词**: `室内场景重建` `合成数据集` `单目几何估计` `布局预测` `点图监督`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有场景重建方法无法恢复被遮挡的结构表面，导致重建不完整。
2. 方法要点：提供RGB图像和两个点图，分别表示可见表面和移除家具后的结构布局。
3. 实验或效果：支持前馈单目几何估计器直接监督，预测场景范围和物体形状位置。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Modern scene reconstruction methods are able to accurately recover 3D
> surfaces that are visible in one or more images. However, this leads to
> incomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress
> has been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using
> generative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors
> and ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements
> should be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,
> repetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this
> work, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates
> progress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated
> pointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing
> the first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the
> structural layout. As we show, this enables direct supervision for feed-forward
> monocular geometry estimators that predict both the first visible surface and
> the first layout surface. This confers an understanding of the scene's extent,
> as well as the shape and location of its objects.
