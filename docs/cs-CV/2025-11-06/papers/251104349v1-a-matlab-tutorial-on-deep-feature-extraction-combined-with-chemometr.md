## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Background In analytical chemistry, spatial information about materials is
> commonly captured through imaging techniques, such as traditional color cameras
> or with advanced hyperspectral cameras and microscopes. However, efficiently
> extracting and analyzing this spatial information for exploratory and
> predictive purposes remains a challenge, especially when using traditional
> chemometric methods. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial
> intelligence have significantly enhanced image processing capabilities,
> enabling the extraction of multiscale deep features that are otherwise
> challenging to capture with conventional image processing techniques. Despite
> the wide availability of open-source deep learning models, adoption in
> analytical chemistry remains limited because of the absence of structured,
> step-by-step guidance for implementing these models.
>   Results This tutorial aims to bridge this gap by providing a step-by-step
> guide for applying deep learning approaches to extract spatial information from
> imaging data and integrating it with other data sources, such as spectral
> information. Importantly, the focus of this work is not on training deep
> learning models for image processing but on using existing open source models
> to extract deep features from imaging data.
>   Significance The tutorial provides MATLAB code tutorial demonstrations,
> showcasing the processing of imaging data from various imaging modalities
> commonly encountered in analytical chemistry. Readers must run the tutorial
> steps on their own datasets using the codes presented in this tutorial.
