## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Large-scale disaster Search And Rescue (SAR) operations are persistently
> challenged by complex terrain and disrupted communications. While Unmanned
> Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area
> search and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a
> significant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine
> collaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an
> error-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a
> low-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap,
> this study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models
> (LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed
> framework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and
> multi-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations. It
> then employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension,
> hierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm. This
> closed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner,
> providing active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual
> monitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR
> task. We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario.
> Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and
> command-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task
> completion time by approximately $64.2\%$ and improved task success rate by
> $7\%$. It also leads to a considerable reduction in subjective cognitive
> workload, with NASA-TLX scores dropping by $42.9\%$. This work establishes the
> potential of LLMs to create more intuitive and effective human-swarm
> collaborations in high-stakes scenarios.
