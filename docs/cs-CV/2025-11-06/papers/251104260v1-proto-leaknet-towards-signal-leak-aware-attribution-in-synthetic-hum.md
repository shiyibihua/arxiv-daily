## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models
> has turned source attribution and authenticity verification into a critical
> challenge for modern computer vision systems. Recent studies suggest that
> diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,
> known as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent
> representations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a
> signal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates
> closed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the
> learned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.
> Operating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates
> partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A
> temporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a
> feature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables
> transparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro
> AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under
> post-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong
> separability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate
> that modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and
> interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics. The code for the whole work will
> be available upon submission.
