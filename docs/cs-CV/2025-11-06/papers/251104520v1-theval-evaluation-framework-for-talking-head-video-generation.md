## 💡 一句话要点

**提出THEval评估框架以解决说话头视频生成中评价指标不足的问题**

**关键词**: `说话头视频生成` `视频评估框架` `唇同步评估` `自然性分析` `质量指标` `生成模型基准`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：说话头视频生成快速发展，但现有评价指标有限，无法全面评估质量、自然性和同步性。
2. 方法要点：设计包含8个指标的框架，强调效率和人类偏好对齐，分析头部、嘴部和眉毛的细粒度动态。
3. 实验或效果：在17个先进模型生成的85,000个视频上测试，发现模型在唇同步表现好，但表达性和无伪影细节生成有挑战。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Video generation has achieved remarkable progress, with generated videos
> increasingly resembling real ones. However, the rapid advance in generation has
> outpaced the development of adequate evaluation metrics. Currently, the
> assessment of talking head generation primarily relies on limited metrics,
> evaluating general video quality, lip synchronization, and on conducting user
> studies. Motivated by this, we propose a new evaluation framework comprising 8
> metrics related to three dimensions (i) quality, (ii) naturalness, and (iii)
> synchronization. In selecting the metrics, we place emphasis on efficiency, as
> well as alignment with human preferences. Based on this considerations, we
> streamline to analyze fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, and eyebrows, as
> well as face quality. Our extensive experiments on 85,000 videos generated by
> 17 state-of-the-art models suggest that while many algorithms excel in lip
> synchronization, they face challenges with generating expressiveness and
> artifact-free details. These videos were generated based on a novel real
> dataset, that we have curated, in order to mitigate bias of training data. Our
> proposed benchmark framework is aimed at evaluating the improvement of
> generative methods. Original code, dataset and leaderboards will be publicly
> released and regularly updated with new methods, in order to reflect progress
> in the field.
