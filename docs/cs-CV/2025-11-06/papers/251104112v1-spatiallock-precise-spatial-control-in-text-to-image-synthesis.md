## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Text-to-Image (T2I) synthesis has made significant advancements in recent
> years, driving applications such as generating datasets automatically. However,
> precise control over object localization in generated images remains a
> challenge. Existing methods fail to fully utilize positional information,
> leading to an inadequate understanding of object spatial layouts. To address
> this issue, we propose SpatialLock, a novel framework that leverages perception
> signals and grounding information to jointly control the generation of spatial
> locations. SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection
> (PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG). PoI directly integrates spatial
> information through an attention layer, encouraging the model to learn the
> grounding information effectively. PoG employs perception-based supervision to
> further refine object localization. Together, these components enable the model
> to generate objects with precise spatial arrangements and improve the visual
> quality of the generated images. Experiments show that SpatialLock sets a new
> state-of-the-art for precise object positioning, achieving IOU scores above 0.9
> across multiple datasets.
