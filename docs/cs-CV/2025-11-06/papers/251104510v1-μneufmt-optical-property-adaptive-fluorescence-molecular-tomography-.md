## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) is a promising technique for
> non-invasive 3D visualization of fluorescent probes, but its reconstruction
> remains challenging due to the inherent ill-posedness and reliance on
> inaccurate or often-unknown tissue optical properties. While deep learning
> methods have shown promise, their supervised nature limits generalization
> beyond training data. To address these problems, we propose $\mu$NeuFMT, a
> self-supervised FMT reconstruction framework that integrates implicit
> neural-based scene representation with explicit physical modeling of photon
> propagation. Its key innovation lies in jointly optimize both the fluorescence
> distribution and the optical properties ($\mu$) during reconstruction,
> eliminating the need for precise prior knowledge of tissue optics or
> pre-conditioned training data. We demonstrate that $\mu$NeuFMT robustly
> recovers accurate fluorophore distributions and optical coefficients even with
> severely erroneous initial values (0.5$\times$ to 2$\times$ of ground truth).
> Extensive numerical, phantom, and in vivo validations show that $\mu$NeuFMT
> outperforms conventional and supervised deep learning approaches across diverse
> heterogeneous scenarios. Our work establishes a new paradigm for robust and
> accurate FMT reconstruction, paving the way for more reliable molecular imaging
> in complex clinically related scenarios, such as fluorescence guided surgery.
