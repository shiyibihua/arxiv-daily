## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Early diagnosis of critical diseases can significantly improve patient
> survival and reduce treatment costs. However, existing diagnostic techniques
> are often costly, invasive, and inaccessible in low-resource regions. This
> paper presents a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic framework
> integrating image analysis, thermal imaging, and audio signal processing for
> early detection of three major health conditions: skin cancer, vascular blood
> clots, and cardiopulmonary abnormalities. A fine-tuned MobileNetV2
> convolutional neural network was trained on the ISIC 2019 dataset for skin
> lesion classification, achieving 89.3% accuracy, 91.6% sensitivity, and 88.2%
> specificity. A support vector machine (SVM) with handcrafted features was
> employed for thermal clot detection, achieving 86.4% accuracy (AUC = 0.89) on
> synthetic and clinical data. For cardiopulmonary analysis, lung and heart sound
> datasets from PhysioNet and Pascal were processed using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
> Coefficients (MFCC) and classified via Random Forest, reaching 87.2% accuracy
> and 85.7% sensitivity. Comparative evaluation against state-of-the-art models
> demonstrates that the proposed system achieves competitive results while
> remaining lightweight and deployable on low-cost devices. The framework
> provides a promising step toward scalable, real-time, and accessible AI-based
> pre-diagnostic healthcare solutions.
