## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Soft, vine-inspired growing robots that move by eversion are highly mobile in
> confined environments, but, when faced with gaps in the environment, they may
> collapse under their own weight while navigating a desired path. In this work,
> we present a comprehensive collapse model that can predict the collapse length
> of steered robots in any shape using true shape information and tail tension.
> We validate this model by collapsing several unsteered robots without true
> shape information. The model accurately predicts the trends of those
> experiments. We then attempt to collapse a robot steered with a single actuator
> at different orientations. Our models accurately predict collapse when it
> occurs. Finally, we demonstrate how this could be used in the field by having a
> robot attempt a gap-crossing task with and without inflating its actuators. The
> robot needs its actuators inflated to cross the gap without collapsing, which
> our model supports. Our model has been specifically tested on straight and
> series pouch motor-actuated robots made of non-stretchable material, but it
> could be applied to other robot variations. This work enables us to model the
> robot's collapse behavior in any open environment and understand the parameters
> it needs to succeed in 3D navigation tasks.
