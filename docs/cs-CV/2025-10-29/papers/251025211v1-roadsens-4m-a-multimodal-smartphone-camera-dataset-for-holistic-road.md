## 📄 摘要（原文）

> It's important to monitor road issues such as bumps and potholes to enhance
> safety and improve road conditions. Smartphones are equipped with various
> built-in sensors that offer a cost-effective and straightforward way to assess
> road quality. However, progress in this area has been slow due to the lack of
> high-quality, standardized datasets. This paper discusses a new dataset created
> by a mobile app that collects sensor data from devices like GPS,
> accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, gravity sensors, and orientation
> sensors. This dataset is one of the few that integrates Geographic Information
> System (GIS) data with weather information and video footage of road
> conditions, providing a comprehensive understanding of road issues with
> geographic context. The dataset allows for a clearer analysis of road
> conditions by compiling essential data, including vehicle speed, acceleration,
> rotation rates, and magnetic field intensity, along with the visual and spatial
> context provided by GIS, weather, and video data. Its goal is to provide
> funding for initiatives that enhance traffic management, infrastructure
> development, road safety, and urban planning. Additionally, the dataset will be
> publicly accessible to promote further research and innovation in smart
> transportation systems.
