## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
> reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
> reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
> \textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
> point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
> such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
> spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
> may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
> misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
> avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
> LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
> geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
> accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
> back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
> optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
> $\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
> metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
> from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
> In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
> Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
> geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
> road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
> method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more
> accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.
