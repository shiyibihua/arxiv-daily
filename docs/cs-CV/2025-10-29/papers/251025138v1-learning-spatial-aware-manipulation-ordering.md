## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Manipulation in cluttered environments is challenging due to spatial
> dependencies among objects, where an improper manipulation order can cause
> collisions or blocked access. Existing approaches often overlook these spatial
> relationships, limiting their flexibility and scalability. To address these
> limitations, we propose OrderMind, a unified spatial-aware manipulation
> ordering framework that directly learns object manipulation priorities based on
> spatial context. Our architecture integrates a spatial context encoder with a
> temporal priority structuring module. We construct a spatial graph using
> k-Nearest Neighbors to aggregate geometric information from the local layout
> and encode both object-object and object-manipulator interactions to support
> accurate manipulation ordering in real-time. To generate physically and
> semantically plausible supervision signals, we introduce a spatial prior
> labeling method that guides a vision-language model to produce reasonable
> manipulation orders for distillation. We evaluate OrderMind on our Manipulation
> Ordering Benchmark, comprising 163,222 samples of varying difficulty. Extensive
> experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that our
> method significantly outperforms prior approaches in effectiveness and
> efficiency, enabling robust manipulation in cluttered scenes.
