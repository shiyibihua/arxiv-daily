## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
> spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
> multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
> reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,
> systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain
> limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal
> spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in
> multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for
> evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on
> post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D
> tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout
> understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.
> We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation
> and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio
> and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through
> new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers
> insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated
> information about this survey, codes and implementation of the open benchmarks
> can be found at https://github.com/zhengxuJosh/Awesome-Spatial-Reasoning.
