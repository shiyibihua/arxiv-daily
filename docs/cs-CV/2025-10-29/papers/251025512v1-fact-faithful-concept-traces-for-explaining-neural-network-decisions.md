## 💡 一句话要点

**提出FaCT模型以提供忠实的概念追踪解释神经网络决策**

**关键词**: `神经网络解释` `概念追踪` `忠实性评估` `跨类概念` `C2-Score` `模型可视化`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有概念解释方法不忠实于模型，且对概念学习有严格假设。
2. 方法要点：设计模型固有机制概念，跨类共享，可忠实追踪其对logit的贡献。
3. 实验或效果：概念更一致、用户更易解释，同时保持ImageNet性能竞争力。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Deep networks have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
> yet getting a global concept-level understanding of how they function remains a
> key challenge. Many post-hoc concept-based approaches have been introduced to
> understand their workings, yet they are not always faithful to the model.
> Further, they make restrictive assumptions on the concepts a model learns, such
> as class-specificity, small spatial extent, or alignment to human expectations.
> In this work, we put emphasis on the faithfulness of such concept-based
> explanations and propose a new model with model-inherent mechanistic
> concept-explanations. Our concepts are shared across classes and, from any
> layer, their contribution to the logit and their input-visualization can be
> faithfully traced. We also leverage foundation models to propose a new
> concept-consistency metric, C$^2$-Score, that can be used to evaluate
> concept-based methods. We show that, compared to prior work, our concepts are
> quantitatively more consistent and users find our concepts to be more
> interpretable, all while retaining competitive ImageNet performance.
