## 💡 一句话要点

**研究鞭状被动动力学在水中的运动，以模拟章鱼触手伸展的弯曲传播。**

**关键词**: `章鱼触手运动` `鞭状动力学` `弯曲传播` `流体动力学` `被动行为模拟`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：章鱼触手伸展的弯曲传播是否与鞭子动力学原理相似。
2. 方法要点：在水中和空气中进行平台鞭打测试，改变材料刚度和驱动速度。
3. 实验或效果：Ecoflex Gel 2臂在150 rpm下重现弯曲传播，但速度曲线与生物不同。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The stereotypical reaching motion of the octopus arm has drawn growing
> attention for its efficient control of a highly deformable body. Previous
> studies suggest that its characteristic bend propagation may share underlying
> principles with the dynamics of a whip. This work investigates whether
> whip-like passive dynamics in water can reproduce the kinematic features
> observed in biological reaching and their similarities and differences.
> Platform-based whipping tests were performed in water and air while
> systematically varying material stiffness and driving speed. Image-based
> quantification revealed that the Ecoflex Gel 2 arm driven at 150 rpm (motor
> speed) reproduced curvature propagation similar to that observed in octopus
> reaching. However, its bend-point velocity decreased monotonically rather than
> exhibiting the biological bell-shaped profile, confirming that the octopus
> reaching movement is not merely a passive whipping behavior. The absence of
> propagation in air further highlights the critical role of the surrounding
> medium in forming octopus-like reaching motion. This study provides a new
> perspective for understand biological reaching movement, and offers a potential
> platform for future hydrodynamic research.
