## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive
> pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of
> multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive
> pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting
> to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose
> Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
> input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
> encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
> contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
> maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
> validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
> biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.
