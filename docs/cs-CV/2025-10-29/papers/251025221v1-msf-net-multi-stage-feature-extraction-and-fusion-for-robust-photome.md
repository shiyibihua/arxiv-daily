## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
> through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
> different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
> often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
> adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
> models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
> details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
> a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
> selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
> which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
> developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
> features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
> MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the
> accuracy of surface normal estimation.
