## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Given the significant advances in machine learning techniques on mobile
> devices, particularly in the domain of computer vision, in this work we
> quantitatively study the performance characteristics of 190 real-world vision
> transformers (ViTs) on mobile devices. Through a comparison with 102 real-world
> convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we provide insights into the factors that
> influence the latency of ViT architectures on mobile devices. Based on these
> insights, we develop a dataset including measured latencies of 1000 synthetic
> ViTs with representative building blocks and state-of-the-art architectures
> from two machine learning frameworks and six mobile platforms. Using this
> dataset, we show that inference latency of new ViTs can be predicted with
> sufficient accuracy for real-world applications.
