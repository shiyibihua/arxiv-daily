## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings presents major
> challenges due to the complexity and variability of natural scenes, where
> models must recognize new objects, actions, and contexts without prior labeled
> examples. This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that
> unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models
> (e.g., GPT-based architectures) to achieve semantic alignment between visual
> and textual modalities. The goal is to enable robust zero-shot comprehension of
> scenes by leveraging natural language as a bridge to generalize over unseen
> categories and contexts. Our approach develops a unified model that embeds
> visual inputs and textual prompts into a shared space, followed by multimodal
> fusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation. Experiments on
> Visual Genome, COCO, ADE20K, and custom real-world datasets demonstrate
> significant gains over state-of-the-art zero-shot models in object recognition,
> activity detection, and scene captioning. The proposed system achieves up to
> 18% improvement in top-1 accuracy and notable gains in semantic coherence
> metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of cross-modal alignment and language
> grounding in enhancing generalization for real-world scene understanding.
