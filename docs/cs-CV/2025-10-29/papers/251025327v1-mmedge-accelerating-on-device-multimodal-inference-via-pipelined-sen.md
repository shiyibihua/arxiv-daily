## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is
> essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer
> interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight
> coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex
> inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device
> multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.
> Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire
> inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,
> allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also
> introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that
> captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain
> accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for
> fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during
> inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and
> input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration
> optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for
> each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping
> mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early
> predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public
> multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle
> (UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly
> reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various
> system and data dynamics.
