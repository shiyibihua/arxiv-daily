## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate
> face videos, raising significant concerns about their potential misuse for
> fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain
> scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to
> their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce
> DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local
> sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen
> forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:
> Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG
> applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture
> fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces
> domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding
> feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and
> enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and
> global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art
> methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior
> robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.
