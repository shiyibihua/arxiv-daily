## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Accurate calibration of a Stewart platform is important for their precise and
> efficient operation. However, the calibration of these platforms using forward
> kinematics is a challenge for researchers because forward kinematics normally
> generates multiple feasible and unfeasible solutions for any pose of the moving
> platform. The complex kinematic relations among the six actuator paths
> connecting the fixed base to the moving platform further compound the
> difficulty in establishing a straightforward and efficient calibration method.
> The authors developed a new forward kinematics-based calibration method using
> Denavit-Hartenberg convention and used the Stewart platform Tiger 66.1
> developed in their lab for experimenting with the photogrammetry-based
> calibration strategies described in this paper. This system became operational
> upon completion of construction, marking its inaugural use. The authors used
> their calibration model for estimating the errors in the system and adopted
> three compensation options or strategies as per Least Square method to improve
> the accuracy of the system. These strategies leveraged a high-resolution
> digital camera and off-the-shelf software to capture the poses of the moving
> platform's center. This process is non-invasive and does not need any
> additional equipment to be attached to the hexapod or any alteration of the
> hexapod hardware. This photogrammetry-based calibration process involves
> multiple high-resolution images from different angles to measure the position
> and orientation of the platform center in the three-dimensional space. The
> Target poses and Actual poses are then compared, and the error compensations
> are estimated using the Least-Squared methods to calculate the Predicted poses.
> Results from each of the three compensation approaches demonstrated noticeable
> enhancements in platform pose accuracies, suggesting room for further
> improvements.
