## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
> progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
> assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
> generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
> behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
> sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
> constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
> For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
> discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
> differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
> addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided
> Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a
> new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive
> comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation
> tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in
> generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences. The code is available
> at https://github.com/scu-zwh/TGBFN.
