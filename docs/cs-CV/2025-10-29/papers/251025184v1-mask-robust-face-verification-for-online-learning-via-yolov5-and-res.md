## 📄 摘要（原文）

> In the contemporary landscape, the fusion of information technology and the
> rapid advancement of artificial intelligence have ushered school education into
> a transformative phase characterized by digitization and heightened
> intelligence. Concurrently, the global paradigm shift caused by the Covid-19
> pandemic has catalyzed the evolution of e-learning, accentuating its
> significance. Amidst these developments, one pivotal facet of the online
> education paradigm that warrants attention is the authentication of identities
> within the digital learning sphere. Within this context, our study delves into
> a solution for online learning authentication, utilizing an enhanced
> convolutional neural network architecture, specifically the residual network
> model. By harnessing the power of deep learning, this technological approach
> aims to galvanize the ongoing progress of online education, while concurrently
> bolstering its security and stability. Such fortification is imperative in
> enabling online education to seamlessly align with the swift evolution of the
> educational landscape. This paper's focal proposition involves the deployment
> of the YOLOv5 network, meticulously trained on our proprietary dataset. This
> network is tasked with identifying individuals' faces culled from images
> captured by students' open online cameras. The resultant facial information is
> then channeled into the residual network to extract intricate features at a
> deeper level. Subsequently, a comparative analysis of Euclidean distances
> against students' face databases is performed, effectively ascertaining the
> identity of each student.
