## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This survey provides an analysis of current methodologies integrating legal
> and logical specifications into the perception, prediction, and planning
> modules of automated driving systems. We systematically explore techniques
> ranging from logic-based frameworks to computational legal reasoning
> approaches, emphasizing their capability to ensure regulatory compliance and
> interpretability in dynamic and uncertain driving environments. A central
> finding is that significant challenges arise at the intersection of perceptual
> reliability, legal compliance, and decision-making justifiability. To
> systematically analyze these challenges, we introduce a taxonomy categorizing
> existing approaches by their theoretical foundations, architectural
> implementations, and validation strategies. We particularly focus on methods
> that address perceptual uncertainty and incorporate explicit legal norms,
> facilitating decisions that are both technically robust and legally defensible.
> The review covers neural-symbolic integration methods for perception,
> logic-driven rule representation, and norm-aware prediction strategies, all
> contributing toward transparent and accountable autonomous vehicle operation.
> We highlight critical open questions and practical trade-offs that must be
> addressed, offering multidisciplinary insights from engineering, logic, and law
> to guide future developments in legally compliant autonomous driving systems.
