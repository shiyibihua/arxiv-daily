## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The growing success of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models stems from the
> promise that pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can endow agents with
> transferable world knowledge and vision-language (VL) grounding, laying a
> foundation for action models with broader generalization. Yet when these VLMs
> are adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their
> original VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we
> conduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning,
> showing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual
> representations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's
> hidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of
> targeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart
> VLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We
> further evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and
> introduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields
> improved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together,
> our analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the
> degradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to
> recover inherited VL capabilities. Code is publicly available:
