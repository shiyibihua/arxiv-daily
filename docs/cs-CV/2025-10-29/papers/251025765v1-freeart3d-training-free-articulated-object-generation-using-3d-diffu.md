## 💡 一句话要点

**提出FreeArt3D框架，利用预训练静态3D扩散模型生成铰接3D对象，无需额外训练。**

**关键词**: `铰接对象生成` `3D扩散模型` `Score Distillation Sampling` `训练自由优化` `4D生成` `几何纹理联合优化`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：铰接3D对象生成依赖密集视图监督或产生粗糙几何，难以扩展。
2. 方法要点：将Score Distillation Sampling扩展至3D-to-4D，联合优化几何、纹理和铰接参数。
3. 实验或效果：生成高保真几何与纹理，准确预测运动结构，泛化性强且快速完成。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,
> and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on
> optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision
> or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric
> approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D
> generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with
> the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending
> these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models
> poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a
> training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of
> training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a
> pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape
> prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by
> treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images
> captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the
> object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring
> task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our
> method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts
> underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object
> categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D
> completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
> approaches in both quality and versatility.
