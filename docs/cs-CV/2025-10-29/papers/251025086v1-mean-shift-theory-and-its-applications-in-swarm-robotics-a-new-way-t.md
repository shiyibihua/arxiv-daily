## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Swarms evolving from collective behaviors among multiple individuals are
> commonly seen in nature, which enables biological systems to exhibit more
> efficient and robust collaboration. Creating similar swarm intelligence in
> engineered robots poses challenges to the design of collaborative algorithms
> that can be programmed at large scales. The assignment-based method has played
> an eminent role for a very long time in solving collaboration problems of robot
> swarms. However, it faces fundamental limitations in terms of efficiency and
> robustness due to its unscalability to swarm variants. This article presents a
> tutorial review on recent advances in assignment-free collaboration of robot
> swarms, focusing on the problem of shape formation. A key theoretical component
> is the recently developed \emph{mean-shift exploration} strategy, which
> improves the collaboration efficiency of large-scale swarms by dozens of times.
> Further, the efficiency improvement is more significant as the swarm scale
> increases. Finally, this article discusses three important applications of the
> mean-shift exploration strategy, including precise shape formation, area
> coverage formation, and maneuvering formation, as well as their corresponding
> industrial scenarios in smart warehousing, area exploration, and cargo
> transportation.
