**关键词**: `多足机器人` `隐式-显式控制` `水陆两栖移动` `腿结构设计` `移动性能评估`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：多环境移动需切换控制器，设计复杂且难以准确切换。
2. 方法要点：设计柔性关节和左右腿结构，采用隐式-显式控制实现统一控制。
3. 实验或效果：评估三种腿结构，确认存在适合水陆环境的统一控制方案。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Multi-legged mobile robots possess high mobility performance in rough terrain
> environments, stemming from their high postural stability, joint flexibility,
> and the redundancy provided by multiple legs. In prior research on navigating
> between different environments such as land and water, the primary strategy
> employed involves switching to a controller that generates an appropriate gait
> for the new environment upon entering it. However, designing appropriate gaits
> for each complex and diverse environment and accurately determining controller
> switching for each environment is challenging. Therefore, this research
> develops a centipede-type mobile robot that navigates both aquatic and
> terrestrial environments with a simple, unified control scheme, based on the
> implicit-explicit control philosophy and by ingeniously designing the robot's
> body structure. In this research, we developed the robot featuring flexible
> joints and left and right legs on each body segment and focused on the leg
> structure which has extensive contact with the environment. This paper
> evaluates the locomotion performance on land and water using the three
> developed leg structures, using the robot's leg slip rate and actuator energy
> consumption as evaluation metrics. The experimental results confirmed the
> existence of an appropriate leg structure capable of navigating both aquatic
> and terrestrial environments under identical control.
