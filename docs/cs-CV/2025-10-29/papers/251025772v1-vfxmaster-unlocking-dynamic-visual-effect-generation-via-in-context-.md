## 💡 一句话要点

**提出VFXMaster框架，通过上下文学习实现动态视觉效果的统一生成与泛化**

**关键词**: `视觉特效生成` `上下文学习` `视频生成` `效果泛化` `注意力机制`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有方法依赖一LoRA一效果，资源密集且无法泛化到未见效果
2. 方法要点：设计上下文条件策略和注意力掩码，实现效果属性解耦与注入
3. 实验或效果：在多种效果类别上有效模仿，并展示对域外效果的出色泛化能力

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
> yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
> methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
> resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
> effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we
> introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video
> generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,
> enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto
> target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to
> unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning
> strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context
> attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential
> effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect
> imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient
> one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on
> tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive
> experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories
> of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain
> effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a
> comprehensive dataset to the community.
