## 💡 一句话要点

**提出机器人能力框架作为边界对象，以促进跨学科协作设计人机协作流程。**

**关键词**: `人机协作设计` `机器人能力框架` `边界对象` `跨学科协作` `任务分配` `知识工件`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：人机协作设计常忽视跨学科知识和工人经验，导致流程不完善。
2. 方法要点：开发机器人能力框架，聚焦高层能力而非内部机制，支持任务分配讨论。
3. 实验或效果：通过机器人专家描述商业机器人和学生设计活动验证框架的实用性和桥梁作用。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> As robots become more adaptable, responsive, and capable of interacting with humans, the design of effective human-robot collaboration becomes critical. Yet, this design process is typically led by monodisciplinary approaches, often overlooking interdisciplinary knowledge and the experiential knowledge of workers who will ultimately share tasks with these systems. To address this gap, we introduce the robotic capabilities framework, a vocabulary that enables transdisciplinary collaborations to meaningfully shape the future of work when robotic systems are integrated into the workplace. Rather than focusing on the internal workings of robots, the framework centers discussion on high-level capabilities, supporting dialogue around which elements of a task should remain human-led and which can be delegated to robots. We developed the framework through reflexive and iterative processes, and applied it in two distinct settings: by engaging roboticists in describing existing commercial robots using its vocabulary, and through a design activity with students working on robotics-related projects. The framework emerges as an intermediate-level knowledge artifact and a boundary object that bridges technical and experiential domains, guiding designers, empowering workers, and contributing to more just and collaborative futures of work.
