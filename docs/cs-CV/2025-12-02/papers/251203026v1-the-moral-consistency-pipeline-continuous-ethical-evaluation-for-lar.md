## 💡 一句话要点

**提出Moral Consistency Pipeline以持续评估大语言模型的道德一致性**

**关键词**: `道德一致性评估` `大语言模型对齐` `闭环框架` `语义风险分析` `自主伦理场景生成`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有对齐框架依赖静态数据，难以评估道德推理在动态场景中的一致性。
2. 方法要点：MoCoP为无数据集闭环框架，结合词汇完整性分析、语义风险估计和推理建模。
3. 实验或效果：在GPT-4-Turbo和DeepSeek上验证，显示道德与毒性维度强负相关，与响应延迟无关。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The rapid advancement and adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlight the need for moral consistency, the capacity to maintain ethically coherent reasoning across varied contexts. Existing alignment frameworks, structured approaches designed to align model behavior with human ethical and social norms, often rely on static datasets and post-hoc evaluations, offering limited insight into how ethical reasoning may evolve across different contexts or temporal scales. This study presents the Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP), a dataset-free, closed-loop framework for continuously evaluating and interpreting the moral stability of LLMs. MoCoP combines three supporting layers: (i) lexical integrity analysis, (ii) semantic risk estimation, and (iii) reasoning-based judgment modeling within a self-sustaining architecture that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines ethical scenarios without external supervision. Our empirical results on GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek suggest that MoCoP effectively captures longitudinal ethical behavior, revealing a strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity dimensions (correlation rET = -0.81, p value less than 0.001) and a near-zero association with response latency (correlation rEL approximately equal to 0). These findings demonstrate that moral coherence and linguistic safety tend to emerge as stable and interpretable characteristics of model behavior rather than short-term fluctuations. Furthermore, by reframing ethical evaluation as a dynamic, model-agnostic form of moral introspection, MoCoP offers a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous auditing and advances the study of computational morality in autonomous AI systems.
