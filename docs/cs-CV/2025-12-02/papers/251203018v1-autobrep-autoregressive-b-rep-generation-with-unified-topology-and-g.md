## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The boundary representation (B-Rep) is the standard data structure used in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) for defining solid models. Despite recent progress, directly generating B-Reps end-to-end with precise geometry and watertight topology remains a challenge. This paper presents AutoBrep, a novel Transformer model that autoregressively generates B-Reps with high quality and validity. AutoBrep employs a unified tokenization scheme that encodes both geometric and topological characteristics of a B-Rep model as a sequence of discrete tokens. Geometric primitives (i.e., surfaces and curves) are encoded as latent geometry tokens, and their structural relationships are defined as special topological reference tokens. Sequence order in AutoBrep naturally follows a breadth first traversal of the B-Rep face adjacency graph. At inference time, neighboring faces and edges along with their topological structure are progressively generated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our unified representation when coupled with next-token prediction for B-Rep generation. AutoBrep outperforms baselines with better quality and watertightness. It is also highly scalable to complex solids with good fidelity and inference speed. We further show that autocompleting B-Reps is natively supported through our unified tokenization, enabling user-controllable CAD generation with minimal changes.
