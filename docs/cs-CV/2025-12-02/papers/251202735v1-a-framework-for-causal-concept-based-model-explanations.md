## 💡 一句话要点

**提出因果概念框架以生成可理解且忠实的事后模型解释**

**关键词**: `因果概念解释` `事后可解释人工智能` `概念干预` `模型忠实性` `CelebA数据集`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：非可解释模型需提供易懂且忠实于模型的解释
2. 方法要点：基于概念干预的充分概率生成局部和全局解释
3. 实验或效果：在CelebA数据集上构建概念模型展示解释示例

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This work presents a conceptual framework for causal concept-based post-hoc Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), based on the requirements that explanations for non-interpretable models should be understandable as well as faithful to the model being explained. Local and global explanations are generated by calculating the probability of sufficiency of concept interventions. Example explanations are presented, generated with a proof-of-concept model made to explain classifiers trained on the CelebA dataset. Understandability is demonstrated through a clear concept-based vocabulary, subject to an implicit causal interpretation. Fidelity is addressed by highlighting important framework assumptions, stressing that the context of explanation interpretation must align with the context of explanation generation.
