## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We extend the moduli-theoretic framework of psychometric batteries to the domain of dynamical systems. While previous work established the AAI capability score as a static functional on the space of agent representations, this paper formalizes the agent as a flow $ν_r$ parameterized by computational resource $r$, governed by a recursive Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator. We prove that this operator generates a vector field on the parameter manifold $Θ$, and we identify the coefficient of self-improvement $κ$ as the Lie derivative of the capability functional along this flow.
>   The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the Variance Inequality, a spectral condition that is sufficient (under mild regularity) for the stability of self-improvement. We show that a sufficient condition for $κ> 0$ is that, up to curvature and step-size effects, the combined noise of generation and verification must be small enough.
>   We then apply this formalism to unify the recent literature on Language Self-Play (LSP), Self-Correction, and Synthetic Data bootstrapping. We demonstrate that architectures such as STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GANs and AlphaZero are specific topological realizations of the GVU operator that satisfy the Variance Inequality through filtration, adversarial discrimination, or grounding in formal systems.
