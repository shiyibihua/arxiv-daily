## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Traditional language models face a challenge from hallucinations. Their very presence casts a large, dangerous shadow over the promising realm of natural language processing. It becomes crucial to understand the various kinds of hallucinations that occur nowadays, their origins, and ways of reducing them. This document provides a concise and straightforward summary of that. It serves as a one-stop resource for a general understanding of hallucinations and how to mitigate them.
