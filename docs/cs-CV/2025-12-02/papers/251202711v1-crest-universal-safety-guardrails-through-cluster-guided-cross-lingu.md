**关键词**: `多语言安全分类` `跨语言迁移` `参数高效模型` `低资源语言` `安全护栏` `聚类引导`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 问题：现有安全护栏主要针对高资源语言，低资源语言安全防护不足。
2. 方法：基于13种高资源语言训练，利用聚类实现跨语言迁移至100种语言，参数高效。
3. 效果：在六个安全基准上超越同类规模模型，与更大参数模型竞争。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Ensuring content safety in large language models (LLMs) is essential for their deployment in real-world applications. However, existing safety guardrails are predominantly tailored for high-resource languages, leaving a significant portion of the world's population underrepresented who communicate in low-resource languages. To address this, we introduce CREST (CRoss-lingual Efficient Safety Transfer), a parameter-efficient multilingual safety classification model that supports 100 languages with only 0.5B parameters. By training on a strategically chosen subset of only 13 high-resource languages, our model utilizes cluster-based cross-lingual transfer from a few to 100 languages, enabling effective generalization to both unseen high-resource and low-resource languages. This approach addresses the challenge of limited training data in low-resource settings. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across six safety benchmarks to demonstrate that CREST outperforms existing state-of-the-art guardrails of comparable scale and achieves competitive results against models with significantly larger parameter counts (2.5B parameters and above). Our findings highlight the limitations of language-specific guardrails and underscore the importance of developing universal, language-agnostic safety systems that can scale effectively to serve global populations.
