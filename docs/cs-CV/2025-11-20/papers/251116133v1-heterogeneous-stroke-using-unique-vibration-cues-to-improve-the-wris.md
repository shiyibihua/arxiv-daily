## 💡 一句话要点

**提出Heterogeneous Stroke设计概念，通过独特振动提示提升腕戴触觉显示器的识别准确率。**

**关键词**: `腕戴触觉显示器` `时空触觉模式` `振动触觉` `识别准确率` `人机交互`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：腕戴触觉显示器因皮肤区域有限和空间敏锐度低，导致相邻触觉器间混淆，识别准确率低。
2. 方法要点：为每个触觉器分配独特振动刺激，减少混淆，提高信息传递准确性。
3. 实验或效果：实现高准确率（字母93.8%，数字92.4%），并在不同手臂姿势下保持稳定。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Beyond a simple notification of incoming calls or messages, more complex information such as alphabets and digits can be delivered through spatiotemporal tactile patterns (STPs) on a wrist-worn tactile display (WTD) with multiple tactors. However, owing to the limited skin area and spatial acuity of the wrist, frequent confusions occur between closely located tactors, resulting in a low recognition accuracy. Furthermore, the accuracies reported in previous studies have mostly been measured for a specific posture and could further decrease with free arm postures in real life. Herein, we present Heterogeneous Stroke, a design concept for improving the recognition accuracy of STPs on a WTD. By assigning unique vibrotactile stimuli to each tactor, the confusion between tactors can be reduced. Through our implementation of Heterogeneous Stroke, the alphanumeric characters could be delivered with high accuracy (93.8% for 26 alphabets and 92.4% for 10 digits) across different arm postures.
