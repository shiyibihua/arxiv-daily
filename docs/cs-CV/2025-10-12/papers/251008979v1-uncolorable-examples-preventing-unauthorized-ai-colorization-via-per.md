## 📄 摘要（原文）

> AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
> color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
> infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
> monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
> currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
> first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
> perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
> ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
> imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
> Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
> meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
> Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
> transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
> and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
> on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
> degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
> work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
> colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.
