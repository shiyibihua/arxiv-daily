## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper presents the classification of a general quadric into an
> axisymmetric quadric (AQ) and the solution to the problem of the proximity of a
> given point to an AQ. The problem of proximity in $R^3$ is reduced to the same
> in $R^2$, which is not found in the literature. A new method to solve the
> problem in $R^2$ is used based on the geometrical properties of the conics,
> such as sub-normal, length of the semi-major axis, eccentricity, slope and
> radius. Furthermore, the problem in $R^2$ is categorised into two and three
> more sub-cases for parabola and ellipse/hyperbola, respectively, depending on
> the location of the point, which is a novel approach as per the authors'
> knowledge. The proposed method is suitable for implementation in a common
> programming language, such as C and proved to be faster than a commercial
> library, namely, Bullet.
