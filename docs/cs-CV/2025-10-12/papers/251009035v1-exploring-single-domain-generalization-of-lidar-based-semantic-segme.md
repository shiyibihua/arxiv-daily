## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
> enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
> environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
> re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
> essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
> imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
> accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
> reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
> extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
> unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
> use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
> Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
> and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
> learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
> find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
> We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
> that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
> confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
> performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
> 52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
> Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
> demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is
> available on our project page.
