**关键词**: `跨域序列推荐` `大语言模型` `语义标签生成` `多注意力机制` `物品表示增强`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 跨域序列推荐需捕获域内和跨域用户行为模式，以提供个性化体验
2. 集成大语言模型生成语义标签，结合多特征构建增强物品表示
3. 在四个电商数据集上实验，TEMA-LLM优于现有基线方法

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern
> consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with
> diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These
> systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain
> behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences.
> To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
> Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
> framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
> tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
> domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
> descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
> well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
> A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
> model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
> capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
> large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
> outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
> semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
> recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
> to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer
> electronics.
