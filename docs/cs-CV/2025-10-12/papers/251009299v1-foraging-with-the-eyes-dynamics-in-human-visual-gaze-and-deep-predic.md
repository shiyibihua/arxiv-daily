## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed
> step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human
> visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional
> models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics
> of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad
> applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study,
> we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants
> viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4
> million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data
> shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin
> to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual
> information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a
> convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image
> input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across
> novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable
> from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human
> visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and
> open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.
