## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
> reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
> urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
> technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
> complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and
> interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection
> accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper
> proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
> a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
> appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
> strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
> JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID
> switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
> the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of
> MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the
> advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.
