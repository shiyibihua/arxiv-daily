## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics,
> requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for
> smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been
> explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such
> deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,
> extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies
> on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent
> effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING
> (FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a
> differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and
> temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the
> network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable
> transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D
> images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications -
> including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing -
> show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster
> convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at
> http://schardong.github.io/flowing.
