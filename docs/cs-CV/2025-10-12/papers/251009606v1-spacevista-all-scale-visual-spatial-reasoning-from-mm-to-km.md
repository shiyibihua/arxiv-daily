## 📄 摘要（原文）

> With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
> made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
> with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
> aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
> tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
> labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
> effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
> individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
> integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
> modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
> the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
> a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
> scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
> approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
> specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
> evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
> manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
> training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
> potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
> spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
> scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
> extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
> demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
> all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on
> https://peiwensun2000.github.io/mm2km .
