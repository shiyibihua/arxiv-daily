## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
> complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
> interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
> interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
> increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
> human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
> of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
> in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
> interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
> i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
> systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
> Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
> video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
> causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
> from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
> propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
> spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
> techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
> DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
> interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
> a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
> and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models
> are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/
