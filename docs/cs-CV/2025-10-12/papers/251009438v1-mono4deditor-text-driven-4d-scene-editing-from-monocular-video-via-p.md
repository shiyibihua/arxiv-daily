## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
> is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
> and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
> precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
> the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
> a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
> method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
> language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
> of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
> localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
> similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
> targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
> editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
> temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
> high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
> preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
> approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.
