**关键词**: `多模态大语言模型` `肩部疾病诊断` `消费级摄像头` `视频理解` `医疗辅助诊断` `可用性指数`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：医疗资源稀缺地区肩部疾病早期诊断困难，需低成本可扩展方案。
2. 方法要点：HMVDx框架分动作理解和疾病诊断任务，由两个MLLMs分别完成。
3. 实验或效果：HMVDx诊断准确率比直接视频诊断提升79.6%，并引入可用性指数评估。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
> are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
> incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
> tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
> diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
> low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
> introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
> diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
> of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
> shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
> (HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
> disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
> to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
> Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
> recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
> effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
> medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
> medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
> the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
> 79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
> contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
> understanding in the medical field.
