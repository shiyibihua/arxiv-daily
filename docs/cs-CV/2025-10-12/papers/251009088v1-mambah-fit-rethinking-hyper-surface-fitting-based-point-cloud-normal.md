## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for
> hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal
> estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric
> structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently,
> state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong
> modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear
> complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However,
> existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape
> structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details
> largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an
> Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse
> multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric
> context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we
> further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud
> patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective
> fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive
> experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing
> ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies
> further validate the contribution of the proposed components.
