## 💡 一句话要点

**提出目标导向后门攻击，通过物理对象操纵视觉-语言-动作模型**

**关键词**: `后门攻击` `视觉-语言-动作模型` `物理触发` `目标导向` `安全评估` `机器人控制`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：视觉-语言-动作模型依赖未筛选数据集，易受物理对象后门攻击威胁。
2. 方法要点：注入物理触发对象，使模型在触发时执行预设目标动作，正常时无影响。
3. 实验效果：攻击成功率97%，清洁输入性能零下降，动作轨迹和颜色影响显著。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Recent advances in vision-language-action (VLA) models have greatly improved
> embodied AI, enabling robots to follow natural language instructions and
> perform diverse tasks. However, their reliance on uncurated training datasets
> raises serious security concerns. Existing backdoor attacks on VLAs mostly
> assume white-box access and result in task failures instead of enforcing
> specific actions. In this work, we reveal a more practical threat: attackers
> can manipulate VLAs by simply injecting physical objects as triggers into the
> training dataset. We propose goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA), where the
> VLA behaves normally in the absence of physical triggers but executes
> predefined and goal-oriented actions in the presence of physical triggers.
> Specifically, based on a popular VLA benchmark LIBERO, we introduce BadLIBERO
> that incorporates diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions.
> In addition, we propose a three-level evaluation that categorizes the victim
> VLA's actions under GoBA into three states: nothing to do, try to do, and
> success to do. Experiments show that GoBA enables the victim VLA to
> successfully achieve the backdoor goal in 97 percentage of inputs when the
> physical trigger is present, while causing zero performance degradation on
> clean inputs. Finally, by investigating factors related to GoBA, we find that
> the action trajectory and trigger color significantly influence attack
> performance, while trigger size has surprisingly little effect. The code and
> BadLIBERO dataset are accessible via the project page at
> https://goba-attack.github.io/.
