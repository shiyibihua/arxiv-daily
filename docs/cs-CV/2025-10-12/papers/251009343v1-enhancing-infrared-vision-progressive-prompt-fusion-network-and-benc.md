## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image
> enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on
> tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making
> it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement
> methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited
> effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of
> this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt
> Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt
> pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we
> fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing
> adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific
> degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective
> Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the
> model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not
> only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,
> but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we
> introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a
> wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach
> not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also
> significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a
> notable 8.76\% improvement. Code is available at
