## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
> overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
> generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
> hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
> textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
> well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
> neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
> quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
> quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
> abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
> training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
> high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
> without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
> designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
> visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
> incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
> hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
> from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
> evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
> judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
> image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
> hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
> effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.
