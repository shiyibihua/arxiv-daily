## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Pseudo-haptics exploit carefully crafted visual or auditory cues to trick the
> brain into "feeling" forces that are never physically applied, offering a
> low-cost alternative to traditional haptic hardware. Here, we present a
> comparative psychophysical study that quantifies how visual and auditory
> stimuli combine to evoke pseudo-haptic pressure sensations on a commodity
> tablet. Using a Unity-based Rollball game, participants (n = 4) guided a
> virtual ball across three textured terrains while their finger forces were
> captured in real time with a Robotous RFT40 force-torque sensor. Each terrain
> was paired with a distinct rolling-sound profile spanning 440 Hz - 4.7 kHz, 440
> Hz - 13.1 kHz, or 440 Hz - 8.9 kHz; crevice collisions triggered additional
> "knocking" bursts to heighten realism. Average tactile forces increased
> systematically with cue intensity: 0.40 N, 0.79 N and 0.88 N for visual-only
> trials and 0.41 N, 0.81 N and 0.90 N for audio-only trials on Terrains 1-3,
> respectively. Higher audio frequencies and denser visual textures both elicited
> stronger muscle activation, and their combination further reduced the force
> needed to perceive surface changes, confirming multisensory integration. These
> results demonstrate that consumer-grade isometric devices can reliably induce
> and measure graded pseudo-haptic feedback without specialized actuators,
> opening a path toward affordable rehabilitation tools, training simulators and
> assistive interfaces.
