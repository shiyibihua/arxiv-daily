## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
> methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
> set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
> to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
> scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
> overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
> this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
> task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
> supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
> Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
> Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
> teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
> "overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
> injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
> reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
> strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
> effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at
