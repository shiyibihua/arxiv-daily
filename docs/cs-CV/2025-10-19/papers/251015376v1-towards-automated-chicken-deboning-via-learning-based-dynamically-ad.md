## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Automating chicken shoulder deboning requires precise 6-DoF cutting through a
> partially occluded, deformable, multi-material joint, since contact with the
> bones presents serious health and safety risks. Our work makes both
> systems-level and algorithmic contributions to train and deploy a reactive
> force-feedback cutting policy that dynamically adapts a nominal trajectory and
> enables full 6-DoF knife control to traverse the narrow joint gap while
> avoiding contact with the bones. First, we introduce an open-source
> custom-built simulator for multi-material cutting that models coupling,
> fracture, and cutting forces, and supports reinforcement learning, enabling
> efficient training and rapid prototyping. Second, we design a reusable physical
> testbed to emulate the chicken shoulder: two rigid "bone" spheres with
> controllable pose embedded in a softer block, enabling rigorous and repeatable
> evaluation while preserving essential multi-material characteristics of the
> target problem. Third, we train and deploy a residual RL policy, with
> discretized force observations and domain randomization, enabling robust
> zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and the first demonstration of a learned policy
> that debones a real chicken shoulder. Our experiments in our simulator, on our
> physical testbed, and on real chicken shoulders show that our learned policy
> reliably navigates the joint gap and reduces undesired bone/cartilage contact,
> resulting in up to a 4x improvement over existing open-loop cutting baselines
> in terms of success rate and bone avoidance. Our results also illustrate the
> necessity of force feedback for safe and effective multi-material cutting. The
