## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban
> scenes is a challenging yet valuable task in providing immersive and embodied
> applications. The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality
> real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this
> paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by
> synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic
> coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality
> close-up appearances. We propose \textbf{Skyfall-GS}, the first city-block
> scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring
> real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative
> refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and
> photorealistic textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyfall-GS
> provides improved cross-view consistent geometry and more realistic textures
> compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Project page:
