## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Aerial transportation robots using suspended cables have emerged as versatile
> platforms for disaster response and rescue operations. To maximize the
> capabilities of these systems, robots need to aggressively fly through tightly
> constrained environments, such as dense forests and structurally unsafe
> buildings, while minimizing flight time and avoiding obstacles. Existing
> methods geometrically over-approximate the vehicle and obstacles, leading to
> conservative maneuvers and increased flight times. We eliminate these
> restrictions by proposing PolyFly, an optimal global planner which considers a
> non-conservative representation for aerial transportation by modeling each
> physical component of the environment, and the robot (quadrotor, cable and
> payload), as independent polytopes. We further increase the model accuracy by
> incorporating the attitude of the physical components by constructing
> orientation-aware polytopes. The resulting optimal control problem is
> efficiently solved by converting the polytope constraints into smooth
> differentiable constraints via duality theory. We compare our method against
> the existing state-of-the-art approach in eight maze-like environments and show
> that PolyFly produces faster trajectories in each scenario. We also
> experimentally validate our proposed approach on a real quadrotor with a
> suspended payload, demonstrating the practical reliability and accuracy of our
> method.
