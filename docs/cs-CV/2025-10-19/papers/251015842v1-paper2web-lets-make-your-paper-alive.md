## 💡 一句话要点

**提出Paper2Web基准和PWAgent管道，以生成交互式学术网页。**

**关键词**: `学术网页生成` `基准评估` `交互式设计` `LLM评估` `自主代理`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 当前学术网页生成方法难以实现布局感知和交互，缺乏全面评估框架。
2. 引入基准数据集和多维评估，包括规则指标和LLM-as-a-Judge。
3. PWAgent通过迭代优化内容和布局，在实验中显著优于基线方法。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Academic project websites can more effectively disseminate research when they
> clearly present core content and enable intuitive navigation and interaction.
> However, current approaches such as direct Large Language Model (LLM)
> generation, templates, or direct HTML conversion struggle to produce
> layout-aware, interactive sites, and a comprehensive evaluation suite for this
> task has been lacking. In this paper, we introduce Paper2Web, a benchmark
> dataset and multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing academic
> webpage generation. It incorporates rule-based metrics like Connectivity,
> Completeness and human-verified LLM-as-a-Judge (covering interactivity,
> aesthetics, and informativeness), and PaperQuiz, which measures paper-level
> knowledge retention. We further present PWAgent, an autonomous pipeline that
> converts scientific papers into interactive and multimedia-rich academic
> homepages. The agent iteratively refines both content and layout through MCP
> tools that enhance emphasis, balance, and presentation quality. Our experiments
> show that PWAgent consistently outperforms end-to-end baselines like
> template-based webpages and arXiv/alphaXiv versions by a large margin while
> maintaining low cost, achieving the Pareto-front in academic webpage
> generation.
