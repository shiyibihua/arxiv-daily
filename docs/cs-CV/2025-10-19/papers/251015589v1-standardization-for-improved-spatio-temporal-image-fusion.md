**关键词**: `时空图像融合` `图像标准化` `上采样方法` `锐化技术` `USTFIP方法`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：不同传感器图像分辨率不匹配限制时空图像融合应用。
2. 方法要点：比较传统上采样与基于异常的锐化方法ABSIS。
3. 实验效果：ABSIS显著提升USTFIP方法光谱和空间精度。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion (STIF) methods usually require sets of images
> with matching spatial and spectral resolutions captured by different sensors.
> To facilitate the application of STIF methods, we propose and compare two
> different standardization approaches. The first method is based on traditional
> upscaling of the fine-resolution images. The second method is a sharpening
> approach called Anomaly Based Satellite Image Standardization (ABSIS) that
> blends the overall features found in the fine-resolution image series with the
> distinctive attributes of a specific coarse-resolution image to produce images
> that more closely resemble the outcome of aggregating the fine-resolution
> images. Both methods produce a significant increase in accuracy of the Unpaired
> Spatio Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) STIF method, with the
> sharpening approach increasing the spectral and spatial accuracies of the fused
> images by up to 49.46\% and 78.40\%, respectively.
