**关键词**: `家禽养殖监测` `多传感器融合` `边缘AI分析` `生产预测` `福利指标提取`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 家禽养殖面临生产力与福利平衡挑战，缺乏低成本连续监测工具
2. 平台整合六模块，包括相机布局优化、视听监测、实时蛋计数和预测模型
3. 现场试验显示100%蛋计数准确率，支持异常检测和短期预测

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Poultry farming faces increasing pressure to meet productivity targets while
> ensuring animal welfare and environmental compliance. Yet many small and
> medium-sized farms lack affordable, integrated tools for continuous monitoring
> and decision-making, relying instead on manual, reactive inspections. This
> paper presents Poultry Farm Intelligence (PoultryFI) - a modular,
> cost-effective platform that integrates six AI-powered modules: Camera
> Placement Optimizer, Audio-Visual Monitoring, Analytics & Alerting, Real-Time
> Egg Counting, Production & Profitability Forecasting, and a Recommendation
> Module.
>   Camera layouts are first optimized offline using evolutionary algorithms for
> full poultry house coverage with minimal hardware. The Audio-Visual Monitoring
> module extracts welfare indicators from synchronized video, audio, and feeding
> data. Analytics & Alerting produces daily summaries and real-time
> notifications, while Real-Time Egg Counting uses an edge vision model to
> automate production tracking. Forecasting models predict egg yield and feed
> consumption up to 10 days in advance, and the Recommendation Module integrates
> forecasts with weather data to guide environmental and operational adjustments.
>   This is among the first systems to combine low-cost sensing, edge analytics,
> and prescriptive AI to continuously monitor flocks, predict production, and
> optimize performance. Field trials demonstrate 100% egg-count accuracy on
> Raspberry Pi 5, robust anomaly detection, and reliable short-term forecasting.
> PoultryFI bridges the gap between isolated pilot tools and scalable, farm-wide
> intelligence, empowering producers to proactively safeguard welfare and
> profitability.
