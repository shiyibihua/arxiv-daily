## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Camera movement classification (CMC) models trained on contemporary,
> high-quality footage often degrade when applied to archival film, where noise,
> missing frames, and low contrast obscure motion cues. We bridge this gap by
> assembling a unified benchmark that consolidates two modern corpora into four
> canonical classes and restructures the HISTORIAN collection into five balanced
> categories. Building on this benchmark, we introduce DGME-T, a lightweight
> extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion
> encoding, derived from optical flow, via a learnable and normalised late-fusion
> layer. DGME-T raises the backbone's top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and
> its macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, while still improving the
> demanding World-War-II footage from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and from 81.72%
> to 82.63% macro F1. A cross-domain study further shows that an intermediate
> fine-tuning stage on modern data increases historical performance by more than
> five percentage points. These results demonstrate that structured motion priors
> and transformer representations are complementary and that even a small,
> carefully calibrated motion head can substantially enhance robustness in
> degraded film analysis. Related resources are available at
