## 📄 摘要（原文）

> In autonomous driving, dynamic environment and corner cases pose significant
> challenges to the robustness of ego vehicle's state understanding and decision
> making. We introduce VDRive, a novel pipeline for end-to-end autonomous driving
> that explicitly models state-action mapping to address these challenges,
> enabling interpretable and robust decision making. By leveraging the
> advancement of the state understanding of the Vision Language Action Model
> (VLA) with generative diffusion policy-based action head, our VDRive guides the
> driving contextually and geometrically. Contextually, VLA predicts future
> observations through token generation pre-training, where the observations are
> represented as discrete codes by a Conditional Vector Quantized Variational
> Autoencoder (CVQ-VAE). Geometrically, we perform reinforcement learning
> fine-tuning of the VLA to predict future trajectories and actions based on
> current driving conditions. VLA supplies the current state tokens and predicted
> state tokens for the action policy head to generate hierarchical actions and
> trajectories. During policy training, a learned critic evaluates the actions
> generated by the policy and provides gradient-based feedback, forming an
> actor-critic framework that enables a reinforcement-based policy learning
> pipeline. Experiments show that our VDRive achieves state-of-the-art
> performance in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and nuScenes open-loop
> planning.
