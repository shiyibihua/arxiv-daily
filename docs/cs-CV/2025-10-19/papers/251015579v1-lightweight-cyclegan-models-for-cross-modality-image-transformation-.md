## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Lightweight deep learning models offer substantial reductions in
> computational cost and environmental impact, making them crucial for scientific
> applications. We present a lightweight CycleGAN for modality transfer in
> fluorescence microscopy (confocal to super-resolution STED/deconvolved STED),
> addressing the common challenge of unpaired datasets. By replacing the
> traditional channel-doubling strategy in the U-Net-based generator with a fixed
> channel approach, we drastically reduce trainable parameters from 41.8 million
> to approximately nine thousand, achieving superior performance with faster
> training and lower memory usage. We also introduce the GAN as a diagnostic tool
> for experimental and labeling quality. When trained on high-quality images, the
> GAN learns the characteristics of optimal imaging; deviations between its
> generated outputs and new experimental images can reveal issues such as
> photobleaching, artifacts, or inaccurate labeling. This establishes the model
> as a practical tool for validating experimental accuracy and image fidelity in
> microscopy workflows.
