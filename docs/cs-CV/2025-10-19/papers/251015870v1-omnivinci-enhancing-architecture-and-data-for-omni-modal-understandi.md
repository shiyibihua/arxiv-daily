## 💡 一句话要点

**提出OmniVinci架构与数据增强方法，提升多模态理解能力**

**关键词**: `多模态理解` `模型架构优化` `数据合成` `跨模态对齐` `时间嵌入` `开源LLM`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：机器需跨模态感知，如人类多感官融合。
2. 方法要点：引入OmniAlignNet、Temporal Embedding Grouping和Constrained Rotary Time Embedding。
3. 实验或效果：在多个基准上超越Qwen2.5-Omni，训练数据减少6倍。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive
> across multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce
> OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We
> carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation.
> For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for
> strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared
> omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing
> relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii)
> Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in
> omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that
> generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that
> modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model,
> OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal
> understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while
> using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to
> Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream
> applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.
