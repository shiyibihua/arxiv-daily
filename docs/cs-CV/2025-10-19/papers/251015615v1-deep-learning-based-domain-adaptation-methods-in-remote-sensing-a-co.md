## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Domain adaptation is a crucial and increasingly important task in remote
> sensing, aiming to transfer knowledge from a source domain a differently
> distributed target domain. It has broad applications across various real-world
> applications, including remote sensing element interpretation, ecological
> environment monitoring, and urban/rural planning. However, domain adaptation in
> remote sensing poses significant challenges due to differences in data, such as
> variations in ground sampling distance, imaging modes from various sensors,
> geographical landscapes, and environmental conditions. In recent years, deep
> learning has emerged as a powerful tool for feature representation and
> cross-domain knowledge transfer, leading to widespread adoption in remote
> sensing tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of significant
> advancements in deep learning based domain adaptation for remote sensing. We
> first introduce the preliminary knowledge to clarify key concepts, mathematical
> notations, and the taxonomy of methodologies. We then organize existing
> algorithms from multiple perspectives, including task categorization, input
> mode, supervision paradigm, and algorithmic granularity, providing readers with
> a structured understanding of the field. Next, we review widely used datasets
> and summarize the performance of state-of-the-art methods to provide an
> overview of current progress. We also identify open challenges and potential
> directions to guide future research in domain adaptation for remote sensing.
> Compared to previous surveys, this work addresses a broader range of domain
> adaptation tasks in remote sensing, rather than concentrating on a few
> subfields. It also presents a systematic taxonomy, providing a more
> comprehensive and organized understanding of the field. As a whole, this survey
> can inspire the research community, foster understanding, and guide future work
> in the field.
