3. 在模拟LSST数据上评估，NPE在检测、测量和分类方面优于标准方法

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will
> commence full-scale operations in 2026, yielding an unprecedented volume of
> astronomical images. Constructing an astronomical catalog, a table of imaged
> stars, galaxies, and their properties, is a fundamental step in most scientific
> workflows based on astronomical image data. Traditional deterministic
> cataloging methods lack statistical coherence as cataloging is an ill-posed
> problem, while existing probabilistic approaches suffer from computational
> inefficiency, inaccuracy, or the inability to perform inference with multiband
> coadded images, the primary output format for LSST images. In this article, we
> explore a recently developed Bayesian inference method called neural posterior
> estimation (NPE) as an approach to cataloging. NPE leverages deep learning to
> achieve both computational efficiency and high accuracy. When evaluated on the
> DC2 Simulated Sky Survey -- a highly realistic synthetic dataset designed to
> mimic LSST data -- NPE systematically outperforms the standard LSST pipeline in
> light source detection, flux measurement, star/galaxy classification, and
> galaxy shape measurement. Additionally, NPE provides well-calibrated posterior
> approximations. These promising results, obtained using simulated data,
> illustrate the potential of NPE in the absence of model misspecification.
> Although some degree of model misspecification is inevitable in the application
> of NPE to real LSST images, there are a variety of strategies to mitigate its
> effects.
