## 📄 摘要（原文）

> In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot learning framework for multi-robot
> systems that integrate both spatial and temporal elements: Few-Shot
> Demonstration-Driven Task Coordination and Trajectory Execution (DDACE). Our
> approach leverages temporal graph networks for learning task-agnostic temporal
> sequencing and Gaussian Processes for spatial trajectory modeling, ensuring
> modularity and generalization across various tasks. By decoupling temporal and
> spatial aspects, DDACE requires only a small number of demonstrations,
> significantly reducing data requirements compared to traditional learning from
> demonstration approaches. To validate our proposed framework, we conducted
> extensive experiments in task environments designed to assess various aspects
> of multi-robot coordination-such as multi-sequence execution, multi-action
> dynamics, complex trajectory generation, and heterogeneous configurations. The
> experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully achieves task
> execution under few-shot learning conditions and generalizes effectively across
> dynamic and diverse settings. This work underscores the potential of modular
> architectures in enhancing the practicality and scalability of multi-robot
> systems in real-world applications. Additional materials are available at
