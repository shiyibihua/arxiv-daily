## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Reliable navigation in disaster-response and other unstructured indoor
> settings requires robots not only to avoid obstacles but also to recognise when
> those obstacles can be pushed aside. We present an adaptive, LiDAR and
> odometry-based path-planning framework that embeds this capability into the
> ROS2 Nav2 stack. A new Movable Obstacles Layer labels all LiDAR returns missing
> from a prior static map as tentatively movable and assigns a reduced traversal
> cost. A companion Slow-Pose Progress Checker monitors the ratio of commanded to
> actual velocity; when the robot slows appreciably, the local cost is raised
> from light to heavy, and on a stall to lethal, prompting the global planner to
> back out and re-route. Gazebo evaluations on a Scout Mini, spanning isolated
> objects and cluttered corridors, show higher goal-reach rates and fewer
> deadlocks than a no-layer baseline, with traversal times broadly comparable.
> Because the method relies only on planar scans and CPU-level computation, it
> suits resource-constrained search and rescue robots and integrates into
> heterogeneous platforms with minimal engineering. Overall, the results indicate
> that interaction-aware cost maps are a lightweight, ROS2-native extension for
> navigating among potentially movable obstacles in unstructured settings. The
> full implementation will be released as open source
> athttps://costmap-namo.github.io.
