## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper introduces an anthropomorphic robot hand built entirely using LEGO
> MINDSTORMS: the Educational SoftHand-A, a tendon-driven, highly-underactuated
> robot hand based on the Pisa/IIT SoftHand and related hands. To be suitable for
> an educational context, the design is constrained to use only standard LEGO
> pieces with tests using common equipment available at home. The hand features
> dual motors driving an agonist/antagonist opposing pair of tendons on each
> finger, which are shown to result in reactive fine control. The finger motions
> are synchonized through soft synergies, implemented with a differential
> mechanism using clutch gears. Altogether, this design results in an
> anthropomorphic hand that can adaptively grasp a broad range of objects using a
> simple actuation and control mechanism. Since the hand can be constructed from
> LEGO pieces and uses state-of-the-art design concepts for robotic hands, it has
> the potential to educate and inspire children to learn about the frontiers of
> modern robotics.
