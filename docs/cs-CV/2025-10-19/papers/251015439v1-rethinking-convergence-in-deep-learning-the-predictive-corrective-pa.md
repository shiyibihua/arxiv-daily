## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Despite the remarkable success of the end-to-end paradigm in deep learning,
> it often suffers from slow convergence and heavy reliance on large-scale
> datasets, which fundamentally limits its efficiency and applicability in
> data-scarce domains such as medical imaging. In this work, we introduce the
> Predictive-Corrective (PC) paradigm, a framework that decouples the modeling
> task to fundamentally accelerate learning. Building upon this paradigm, we
> propose a novel network, termed PCMambaNet. PCMambaNet is composed of two
> synergistic modules. First, the Predictive Prior Module (PPM) generates a
> coarse approximation at low computational cost, thereby anchoring the search
> space. Specifically, the PPM leverages anatomical knowledge-bilateral
> symmetry-to predict a 'focus map' of diagnostically relevant asymmetric
> regions. Next, the Corrective Residual Network (CRN) learns to model the
> residual error, focusing the network's full capacity on refining these
> challenging regions and delineating precise pathological boundaries. Extensive
> experiments on high-resolution brain MRI segmentation demonstrate that
> PCMambaNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while converging within only 1-5
> epochs-a performance unattainable by conventional end-to-end models. This
> dramatic acceleration highlights that by explicitly incorporating domain
> knowledge to simplify the learning objective, PCMambaNet effectively mitigates
> data inefficiency and overfitting.
