## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by predicting
> human-understandable concepts as intermediate representations. However,
> existing CBMs often suffer from input-to-concept mapping bias and limited
> controllability, which restricts their practical value, directly damage the
> responsibility of strategy from concept-based methods. We propose a lightweight
> Disentangled Concept Bottleneck Model (LDCBM) that automatically groups visual
> features into semantically meaningful components without region annotation. By
> introducing a filter grouping loss and joint concept supervision, our method
> improves the alignment between visual patterns and concepts, enabling more
> transparent and robust decision-making. Notably, Experiments on three diverse
> datasets demonstrate that LDCBM achieves higher concept and class accuracy,
> outperforming previous CBMs in both interpretability and classification
> performance. By grounding concepts in visual evidence, our method overcomes a
> fundamental limitation of prior models and enhances the reliability of
> interpretable AI.
