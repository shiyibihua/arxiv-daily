## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Automatic medical image segmentation is a fundamental step in computer-aided
> diagnosis, yet fully supervised approaches demand extensive pixel-level
> annotations that are costly and time-consuming. To alleviate this burden, we
> propose a weakly supervised segmentation framework that leverages only four
> extreme points as annotation. Specifically, bounding boxes derived from the
> extreme points are used as prompts for the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to
> generate reliable initial pseudo labels. These pseudo labels are progressively
> refined by an enhanced Feature-Guided Extreme Point Masking (FGEPM) algorithm,
> which incorporates Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty estimation to
> construct a unified gradient uncertainty cost map for boundary tracing.
> Furthermore, a dual-branch Uncertainty-aware Scale Consistency (USC) loss and a
> box alignment loss are introduced to ensure spatial consistency and precise
> boundary alignment during training. Extensive experiments on two public
> ultrasound datasets, BUSI and UNS, demonstrate that our method achieves
> performance comparable to, and even surpassing fully supervised counterparts
> while significantly reducing annotation cost. These results validate the
> effectiveness and practicality of the proposed weakly supervised framework for
> ultrasound image segmentation.
