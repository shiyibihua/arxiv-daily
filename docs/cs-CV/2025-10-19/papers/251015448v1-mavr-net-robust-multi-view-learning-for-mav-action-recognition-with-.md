## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Recognizing the motion of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is crucial for
> enabling cooperative perception and control in autonomous aerial swarms. Yet,
> vision-based recognition models relying only on RGB data often fail to capture
> the complex spatial temporal characteristics of MAV motion, which limits their
> ability to distinguish different actions. To overcome this problem, this paper
> presents MAVR-Net, a multi-view learning-based MAV action recognition
> framework. Unlike traditional single-view methods, the proposed approach
> combines three complementary types of data, including raw RGB frames, optical
> flow, and segmentation masks, to improve the robustness and accuracy of MAV
> motion recognition. Specifically, ResNet-based encoders are used to extract
> discriminative features from each view, and a multi-scale feature pyramid is
> adopted to preserve the spatiotemporal details of MAV motion patterns. To
> enhance the interaction between different views, a cross-view attention module
> is introduced to model the dependencies among various modalities and feature
> scales. In addition, a multi-view alignment loss is designed to ensure semantic
> consistency and strengthen cross-view feature representations. Experimental
> results on benchmark MAV action datasets show that our method clearly
> outperforms existing approaches, achieving 97.8\%, 96.5\%, and 92.8\% accuracy
> on the Short MAV, Medium MAV, and Long MAV datasets, respectively.
