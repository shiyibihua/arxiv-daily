## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Zero-shot anomaly localization is a rising field in computer vision research,
> with important progress in recent years. This work focuses on the problem of
> detecting and localizing anomalies in textures, where anomalies can be defined
> as the regions that deviate from the overall statistics, violating the
> stationarity assumption. The main limitation of existing methods is their high
> running time, making them impractical for deployment in real-world scenarios,
> such as assembly line monitoring. We propose a real-time method, named QFCA,
> which implements a quantized version of the feature correspondence analysis
> (FCA) algorithm. By carefully adapting the patch statistics comparison to work
> on histograms of quantized values, we obtain a 10x speedup with little to no
> loss in accuracy. Moreover, we introduce a feature preprocessing step based on
> principal component analysis, which enhances the contrast between normal and
> anomalous features, improving the detection precision on complex textures. Our
> method is thoroughly evaluated against prior art, comparing favorably with
> existing methods. Project page:
