## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Low-light RAW image enhancement remains a challenging task. Although numerous
> deep learning based approaches have been proposed, they still suffer from
> inherent limitations. A key challenge is how to simultaneously achieve strong
> enhancement quality and high efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
> architecture for efficient low-light image signal processing (ISP) and
> introduce a Hierarchical Mixing Architecture (HiMA). HiMA leverages the
> complementary strengths of Transformer and Mamba modules to handle features at
> large and small scales, respectively, thereby improving efficiency while
> avoiding the ambiguities observed in prior two-stage frameworks. To further
> address uneven illumination with strong local variations, we propose Local
> Distribution Adjustment (LoDA), which adaptively aligns feature distributions
> across different local regions. In addition, to fully exploit the denoised
> outputs from the first stage, we design a Multi-prior Fusion (MPF) module that
> integrates spatial and frequency-domain priors for detail enhancement.
> Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method
> outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance with
> fewer parameters. Code will be released at https://github.com/Cynicarlos/HiMA.
