## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper presents the integration of a Variable Stiffness Link (VSL) for
> long-reach aerial manipulation, enabling adaptable mechanical coupling between
> an aerial multirotor platform and a dual-arm manipulator. Conventional
> long-reach manipulation systems rely on rigid or cable connections, which limit
> precision or transmit disturbances to the aerial vehicle. The proposed VSL
> introduces an adjustable stiffness mechanism that allows the link to behave
> either as a flexible rope or as a rigid rod, depending on task requirements.
>   The system is mounted on a quadrotor equipped with the LiCAS dual-arm
> manipulator and evaluated through teleoperated experiments, involving external
> disturbances and parcel transportation tasks. Results demonstrate that varying
> the link stiffness significantly modifies the dynamic interaction between the
> UAV and the payload. The flexible configuration attenuates external impacts and
> aerodynamic perturbations, while the rigid configuration improves positional
> accuracy during manipulation phases.
>   These results confirm that VSL enhances versatility and safety, providing a
> controllable trade-off between compliance and precision. Future work will focus
> on autonomous stiffness regulation, multi-rope configurations, cooperative
> aerial manipulation and user studies to further assess its impact on
> teleoperated and semi-autonomous aerial tasks.
