## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Light field images capture multi-view scene information and play a crucial
> role in 3D scene reconstruction. However, their high-dimensional nature results
> in enormous data volumes, posing a significant challenge for efficient
> compression in practical storage and transmission scenarios. Although neural
> representation-based methods have shown promise in light field image
> compression, most approaches rely on direct coordinate-to-pixel mapping through
> implicit neural representation (INR), often neglecting the explicit modeling of
> scene structure. Moreover, they typically lack end-to-end rate-distortion
> optimization, limiting their compression efficiency. To address these
> limitations, we propose SANR, a Scene-Aware Neural Representation framework for
> light field image compression with end-to-end rate-distortion optimization. For
> scene awareness, SANR introduces a hierarchical scene modeling block that
> leverages multi-scale latent codes to capture intrinsic scene structures,
> thereby reducing the information gap between INR input coordinates and the
> target light field image. From a compression perspective, SANR is the first to
> incorporate entropy-constrained quantization-aware training (QAT) into neural
> representation-based light field image compression, enabling end-to-end
> rate-distortion optimization. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that
> SANR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques regarding
> rate-distortion performance with a 65.62\% BD-rate saving against HEVC.
