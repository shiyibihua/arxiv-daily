## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Long-form video reasoning remains a major challenge for Video Large Language
> Models (Video LLMs), as static uniform frame sampling leads to information
> dilution and obscures critical evidence. Furthermore, existing pixel-space
> video reasoning agents, which are designed to actively interact with the video
> to acquire new visual information, remain suboptimal due to their lack of
> rigorous reward mechanisms to enforce evidence purity and their inability to
> perform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames. To
> address this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive
> framework built upon our core philosophy: "Select Less, Reason More." Our core
> contribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework,
> which transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence. EARL is
> precisely engineered to dynamically select the most relevant frames and,
> crucially, to perform localized re-sampling around the selected key frames to
> access fine-grained temporal detail. Extensive experiments on five demanding
> video reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our EARL-trained model achieves new
> state-of-the-art among open-source Video LLMs, simultaneously learning an
> effective and high-purity visual evidence selection policy. Impressively, our
> 7B model achieves 59.8% on LongVideoBench, 69.0% on MVBench and 64.9% on
> VideoMME. These results highlight the importance of prioritizing evidence
> purity and the effectiveness of our framework.
