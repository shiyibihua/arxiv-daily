## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the reliable deployment
> of deep learning models. hile Mahalanobis distance methods are widely used, the
> impact of representation geometry and normalization on their performance is not
> fully understood, which may limit their downstream application. To address this
> gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study across diverse image
> foundation models, datasets, and distance normalization schemes. First, our
> analysis shows that Mahalanobis-based methods aren't universally reliable.
> Second, we define the ideal geometry for data representations and demonstrate
> that spectral and intrinsic-dimensionality metrics can accurately predict a
> model's OOD performance. Finally, we analyze how normalization impacts OOD
> performance. Building upon these studies, we propose radially scaled $\ell_2$
> normalization, a method that generalizes the standard $\ell_2$ normalization
> recently applied to Mahalanobis-based OOD detection. Our approach introduces a
> tunable parameter to directly control the radial geometry of the feature space,
> systematically contracting or expanding representations to significantly
> improve OOD detection performance. By bridging the gap between representation
> geometry, normalization, and OOD performance, our findings offer new insights
> into the design of more effective and reliable deep learning models.
