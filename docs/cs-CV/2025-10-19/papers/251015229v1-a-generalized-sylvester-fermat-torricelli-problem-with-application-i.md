## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Natural and human-made disasters can cause severe devastation and claim
> thousands of lives worldwide. Therefore, developing efficient methods for
> disaster response and management is a critical task for relief teams. One of
> the most essential components of effective response is the rapid collection of
> information about affected areas, damages, and victims. More data translates
> into better coordination, faster rescue operations, and ultimately, more lives
> saved. However, in some disasters, such as earthquakes, the communication
> infrastructure is often partially or completely destroyed, making it extremely
> difficult for victims to send distress signals and for rescue teams to locate
> and assist them in time. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as
> valuable tools in such scenarios. In particular, a fleet of UAVs can be
> dispatched from a mobile station to the affected area to facilitate data
> collection and establish temporary communication networks. Nevertheless,
> real-world deployment of UAVs faces several challenges, with adverse weather
> conditions--especially wind--being among the most significant. To address this,
> we develop a novel mathematical framework to determine the optimal location of
> a mobile UAV station while explicitly accounting for the heterogeneity of the
> UAVs and the effect of wind. In particular, we generalize the Sylvester problem
> to introduce the Sylvester-Fermat-Torricelli (SFT) problem, which captures
> complex factors such as wind influence, UAV heterogeneity, and back-and-forth
> motion within a unified framework. The proposed framework enhances the
> practicality of UAV-based disaster response planning by accounting for
> real-world factors such as wind and UAV heterogeneity. Experimental results
> demonstrate that it can reduce wasted operational time by up to 84%, making
> post-disaster missions significantly more efficient and effective.
