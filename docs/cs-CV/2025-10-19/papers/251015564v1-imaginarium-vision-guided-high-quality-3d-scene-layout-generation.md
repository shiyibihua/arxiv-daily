## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Generating artistic and coherent 3D scene layouts is crucial in digital
> content creation. Traditional optimization-based methods are often constrained
> by cumbersome manual rules, while deep generative models face challenges in
> producing content with richness and diversity. Furthermore, approaches that
> utilize large language models frequently lack robustness and fail to accurately
> capture complex spatial relationships. To address these challenges, this paper
> presents a novel vision-guided 3D layout generation system. We first construct
> a high-quality asset library containing 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D scene
> layouts. Subsequently, we employ an image generation model to expand prompt
> representations into images, fine-tuning it to align with our asset library. We
> then develop a robust image parsing module to recover the 3D layout of scenes
> based on visual semantics and geometric information. Finally, we optimize the
> scene layout using scene graphs and overall visual semantics to ensure logical
> coherence and alignment with the images. Extensive user testing demonstrates
> that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
> layout richness and quality. The code and dataset will be available at
> https://github.com/HiHiAllen/Imaginarium.
