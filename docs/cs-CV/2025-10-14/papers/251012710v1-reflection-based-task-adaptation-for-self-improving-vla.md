## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a major leap
> towards general-purpose robots, yet efficiently adapting them to novel,
> specific tasks in-situ remains a significant hurdle. While reinforcement
> learning (RL) is a promising avenue for such adaptation, the process often
> suffers from low efficiency, hindering rapid task mastery. We introduce
> Reflective Self-Adaptation, a framework for rapid, autonomous task adaptation
> without human intervention. Our framework establishes a self-improving loop
> where the agent learns from its own experience to enhance both strategy and
> execution.
>   The core of our framework is a dual-pathway architecture that addresses the
> full adaptation lifecycle. First, a Failure-Driven Reflective RL pathway
> enables rapid learning by using the VLM's causal reasoning to automatically
> synthesize a targeted, dense reward function from failure analysis. This
> provides a focused learning signal that significantly accelerates policy
> exploration. However, optimizing such proxy rewards introduces a potential risk
> of "reward hacking," where the agent masters the reward function but fails the
> actual task. To counteract this, our second pathway, Success-Driven
> Quality-Guided SFT, grounds the policy in holistic success. It identifies and
> selectively imitates high-quality successful trajectories, ensuring the agent
> remains aligned with the ultimate task goal. This pathway is strengthened by a
> conditional curriculum mechanism to aid initial exploration.
>   We conduct experiments in challenging manipulation tasks. The results
> demonstrate that our framework achieves faster convergence and higher final
> success rates compared to representative baselines. Our work presents a robust
> solution for creating self-improving agents that can efficiently and reliably
> adapt to new environments.
