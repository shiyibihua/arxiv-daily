## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Generative Behavior Cloning (GBC) is a simple yet effective framework for
> robot learning, particularly in multi-task settings. Recent GBC methods often
> employ diffusion policies with open-loop (OL) control, where actions are
> generated via a diffusion process and executed in multi-step chunks without
> replanning. While this approach has demonstrated strong success rates and
> generalization, its inherent stochasticity can result in erroneous action
> sampling, occasionally leading to unexpected task failures. Moreover, OL
> control suffers from delayed responses, which can degrade performance in noisy
> or dynamic environments. To address these limitations, we propose two novel
> techniques to enhance the consistency and reactivity of diffusion policies: (1)
> self-guidance, which improves action fidelity by leveraging past observations
> and implicitly promoting future-aware behavior; and (2) adaptive chunking,
> which selectively updates action sequences when the benefits of reactivity
> outweigh the need for temporal consistency. Extensive experiments show that our
> approach substantially improves GBC performance across a wide range of
> simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks. Our code is available at
