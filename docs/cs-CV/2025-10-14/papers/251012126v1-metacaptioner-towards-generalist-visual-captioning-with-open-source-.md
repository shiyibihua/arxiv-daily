## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description
> task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and
> handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models
> present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various
> applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes
> CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for
> the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to
> achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5%
> reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce
> high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain
> a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through
> extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable
> captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier
> multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and
> MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and
> cost-effective visual captioning solution.
