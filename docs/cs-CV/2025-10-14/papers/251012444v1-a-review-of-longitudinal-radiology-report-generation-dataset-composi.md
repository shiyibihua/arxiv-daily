## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and
> its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To
> alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to
> automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically
> accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches,
> however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal
> context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements.
> Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal
> data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that
> mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys
> primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for
> longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for
> model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive
> review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we
> examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures
> alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols
> encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We
> further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different
> ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of
> longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model
> performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research
> and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a
> foundation for advancing this emerging field.
