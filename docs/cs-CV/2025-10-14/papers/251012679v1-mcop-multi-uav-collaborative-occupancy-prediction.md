## 💡 一句话要点

**提出多无人机协作占用预测框架以解决BEV方法语义几何信息缺失与性能下降问题**

**关键词**: `多无人机协作` `占用预测` `3D感知` `特征整合` `通信优化` `无人机群系统`

## 📋 核心要点

1. BEV方法因边界框表示无法捕捉完整语义几何信息，且对未定义或遮挡对象性能显著下降
2. 集成空间感知特征编码与跨代理特征整合，保留3D结构与语义；引入高度感知特征压缩与双掩码感知指导以提升效率
3. 扩展三个数据集评估，实验显示方法在精度上达到最优，同时通信开销大幅降低

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient
> collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current
> Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations:
> bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric
> information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when
> encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we
> propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our
> framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through
> integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature
> Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature
> Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask
> Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce
> communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we
> extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and
> UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results
> demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly
> outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication
> overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.
