## 📄 摘要（原文）

> One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype
> representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical
> variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on
> deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations
> that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.
> This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that
> reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space
> exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability
> distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically
> coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates
> through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement
> module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via
> forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism
> that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,
> and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while
> maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference
> consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both
> phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final
> representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself
> acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets
> demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new
> state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.
