1. 核心问题：现有深度学习方法未充分利用QR码结构化边缘先验，影响解码成功率。
2. 方法要点：设计边缘引导注意力块和自适应双网络，根据模糊程度动态选择模型。
3. 实验或效果：在严重模糊QR码上提升解码率，速度快，适合移动设备部署。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code
> deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized
> by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.
> Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To
> address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which
> embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we
> develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that
> significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly
> blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for
> fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive
> Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on
> input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.
> Extensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve
> state-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed. Project page:
