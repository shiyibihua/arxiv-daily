## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer
> new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics
> and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of
> expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.
> Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,
> which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning
> is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This
> work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object
> detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,
> specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined
> the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator
> tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.
> It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,
> utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our
> findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic
> image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of
> synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection
> models.
