## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require
> access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic
> and ever-changing real-world information in order to address
> information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,
> such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search
> equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and
> poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and
> suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,
> the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web
> searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.
> Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops
> of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively
> adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling
> self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage
> training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an
> online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce
> DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated
> pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This
> dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual
> information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which
> search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct
> extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to
> demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results
> and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.
