## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare.
> However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned
> for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce
> the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining
> sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on
> sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients'
> privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via
> federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals,
> clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated
> fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general
> and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their
> own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world
> federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive
> against current federated fine-tuning methods.
