## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet
> current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.
> This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which
> allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical
> objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive
> Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic
> priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS
> introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and
> Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to
> aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained
> details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering
> pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull
> occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive
> experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves
> exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,
> while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to
> over 350 FPS.
