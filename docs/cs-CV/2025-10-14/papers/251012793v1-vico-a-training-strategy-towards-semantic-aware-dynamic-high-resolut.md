## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased
> inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs.
> In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training
> algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic
> complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our
> method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image
> compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic
> complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between
> the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we
> introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that
> automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.
> Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the
> number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically
> adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.
> Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of
> vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,
> and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of
> more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future
> research.
