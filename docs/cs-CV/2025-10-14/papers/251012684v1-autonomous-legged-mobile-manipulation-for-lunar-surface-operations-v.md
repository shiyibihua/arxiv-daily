## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Robotics plays a pivotal role in planetary science and exploration, where
> autonomous and reliable systems are crucial due to the risks and challenges
> inherent to space environments. The establishment of permanent lunar bases
> demands robotic platforms capable of navigating and manipulating in the harsh
> lunar terrain. While wheeled rovers have been the mainstay for planetary
> exploration, their limitations in unstructured and steep terrains motivate the
> adoption of legged robots, which offer superior mobility and adaptability. This
> paper introduces a constrained reinforcement learning framework designed for
> autonomous quadrupedal mobile manipulators operating in lunar environments. The
> proposed framework integrates whole-body locomotion and manipulation
> capabilities while explicitly addressing critical safety constraints, including
> collision avoidance, dynamic stability, and power efficiency, in order to
> ensure robust performance under lunar-specific conditions, such as reduced
> gravity and irregular terrain. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's
> effectiveness in achieving precise 6D task-space end-effector pose tracking,
> achieving an average positional accuracy of 4 cm and orientation accuracy of
> 8.1 degrees. The system consistently respects both soft and hard constraints,
> exhibiting adaptive behaviors optimized for lunar gravity conditions. This work
> effectively bridges adaptive learning with essential mission-critical safety
> requirements, paving the way for advanced autonomous robotic explorers for
> future lunar missions.
