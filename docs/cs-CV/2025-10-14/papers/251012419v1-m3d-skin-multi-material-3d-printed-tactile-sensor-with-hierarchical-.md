## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Tactile sensors have a wide range of applications, from utilization in
> robotic grippers to human motion measurement. If tactile sensors could be
> fabricated and integrated more easily, their applicability would further
> expand. In this study, we propose a tactile sensor-M3D-skin-that can be easily
> fabricated with high versatility by leveraging the infill patterns of a
> multi-material fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer as the sensing
> principle. This method employs conductive and non-conductive flexible filaments
> to create a hierarchical structure with a specific infill pattern. The flexible
> hierarchical structure deforms under pressure, leading to a change in
> electrical resistance, enabling the acquisition of tactile information. We
> measure the changes in characteristics of the proposed tactile sensor caused by
> modifications to the hierarchical structure. Additionally, we demonstrate the
> fabrication and use of a multi-tile sensor. Furthermore, as applications, we
> implement motion pattern measurement on the sole of a foot, integration with a
> robotic hand, and tactile-based robotic operations. Through these experiments,
> we validate the effectiveness of the proposed tactile sensor.
