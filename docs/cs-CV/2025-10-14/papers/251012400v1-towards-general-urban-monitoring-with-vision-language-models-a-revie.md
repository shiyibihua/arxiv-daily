## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs,
> vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due
> to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved.
> Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT
> sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often
> misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation.
> This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer
> informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language
> Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language
> reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing
> complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address
> this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban
> monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the
> PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021
> and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring
> tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures
> and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3)
> What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based
> applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?
