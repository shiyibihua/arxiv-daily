## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper presents a shape-aware whole-body control framework for
> tendon-driven continuum robots with direct application to endoluminal surgical
> navigation. Endoluminal procedures, such as bronchoscopy, demand precise and
> safe navigation through tortuous, patient-specific anatomy where conventional
> tip-only control often leads to wall contact, tissue trauma, or failure to
> reach distal targets. To address these challenges, our approach combines a
> physics-informed backbone model with residual learning through an Augmented
> Neural ODE, enabling accurate shape estimation and efficient Jacobian
> computation. A sampling-based Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller
> leverages this representation to jointly optimize tip tracking, backbone
> conformance, and obstacle avoidance under actuation constraints. A task manager
> further enhances adaptability by allowing real-time adjustment of objectives,
> such as wall clearance or direct advancement, during tele-operation. Extensive
> simulation studies demonstrate millimeter-level accuracy across diverse
> scenarios, including trajectory tracking, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and
> shape-constrained reaching. Real-robot experiments on a bronchoscopy phantom
> validate the framework, showing improved lumen-following accuracy, reduced wall
> contacts, and enhanced adaptability compared to joystick-only navigation and
> existing baselines. These results highlight the potential of the proposed
> framework to increase safety, reliability, and operator efficiency in minimally
> invasive endoluminal surgery, with broader applicability to other confined and
> safety-critical environments.
