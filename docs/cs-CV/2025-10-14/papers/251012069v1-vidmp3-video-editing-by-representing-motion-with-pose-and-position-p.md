## 💡 一句话要点

**提出VidMP3方法，利用姿态和位置先验解决运动保持视频编辑中的结构灵活性问题。**

**关键词**: `视频编辑` `运动表示` `姿态先验` `位置先验` `扩散模型` `时间一致性`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有视频编辑方法在结构可变编辑中存在时间不一致、主体身份漂移等问题。
2. 方法要点：基于姿态和位置先验学习广义运动表示，实现运动保持与结构语义灵活编辑。
3. 实验或效果：定性和定量评估显示优于现有方法，代码将开源。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in
> scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of
> swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored.
> Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks,
> using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent
> methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from
> issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for
> human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel
> approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion
> representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new
> videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and
> semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
> the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made
> publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.
