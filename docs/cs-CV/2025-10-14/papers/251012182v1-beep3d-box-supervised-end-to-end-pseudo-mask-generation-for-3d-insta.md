## 📄 摘要（原文）

> 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D
> environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level
> annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To
> mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more
> scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce
> ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment
> challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks
> through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.
> However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and
> complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we
> propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance
> segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher
> model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an
> Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate
> precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement
> that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance
> centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and
> masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between
> predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
> datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance
> compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining
> computationally efficient.
