## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Safe and interpretable motion planning in complex urban environments needs to
> reason about bidirectional multi-agent interactions. This reasoning requires to
> estimate the costs of potential ego driving maneuvers. Many existing planners
> generate initial trajectories with sampling-based methods and refine them by
> optimizing on learned predictions of future environment states, which requires
> a cost function that encodes the desired vehicle behavior. Designing such a
> cost function can be very challenging, especially if a wide range of complex
> urban scenarios has to be considered. We propose HYPE: HYbrid Planning with Ego
> proposal-conditioned predictions, a planner that integrates multimodal
> trajectory proposals from a learned proposal model as heuristic priors into a
> Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) refinement. To model bidirectional interactions,
> we introduce an ego-conditioned occupancy prediction model, enabling
> consistent, scene-aware reasoning. Our design significantly simplifies cost
> function design in refinement by considering proposal-driven guidance,
> requiring only minimalistic grid-based cost terms. Evaluations on large-scale
> real-world benchmarks nuPlan and DeepUrban show that HYPE effectively achieves
> state-of-the-art performance, especially in safety and adaptability.
