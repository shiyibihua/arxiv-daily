## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Dexterous grasping remains a central challenge in robotics due to the
> complexity of its high-dimensional state and action space. We introduce T(R,O)
> Grasp, a diffusion-based framework that efficiently generates accurate and
> diverse grasps across multiple robotic hands. At its core is the T(R,O) Graph,
> a unified representation that models spatial transformations between robotic
> hands and objects while encoding their geometric properties. A graph diffusion
> model, coupled with an efficient inverse kinematics solver, supports both
> unconditioned and conditioned grasp synthesis. Extensive experiments on a
> diverse set of dexterous hands show that T(R,O) Grasp achieves average success
> rate of 94.83%, inference speed of 0.21s, and throughput of 41 grasps per
> second on an NVIDIA A100 40GB GPU, substantially outperforming existing
> baselines. In addition, our approach is robust and generalizable across
> embodiments while significantly reducing memory consumption. More importantly,
> the high inference speed enables closed-loop dexterous manipulation,
> underscoring the potential of T(R,O) Grasp to scale into a foundation model for
> dexterous grasping.
