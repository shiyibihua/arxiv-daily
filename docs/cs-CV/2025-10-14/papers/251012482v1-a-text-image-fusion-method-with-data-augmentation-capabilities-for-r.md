## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data,
> especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and
> images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation.
> However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial
> alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we
> propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before
> augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight
> generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic
> gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region
> localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four
> segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is publicly
> available on GitHub: https://github.com/11yxk/MedSeg_EarlyFusion.
