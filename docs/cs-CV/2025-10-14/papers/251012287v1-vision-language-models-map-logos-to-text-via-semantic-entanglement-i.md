## 💡 一句话要点

**揭示视觉语言模型因投影器语义纠缠导致徽标幻觉，并提出缓解方法**

**关键词**: `视觉语言模型` `徽标幻觉` `投影器分析` `语义纠缠` `OCR引导解码` `多模态鲁棒性`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：视觉语言模型在无文字徽标上产生品牌名称幻觉，依赖符号先验而非真实字形感知。
2. 方法要点：通过嵌入分析和针对性消融，识别并减少投影器维度中的幻觉相关子空间。
3. 实验效果：在扰动和遮挡测试中，幻觉持续存在，消融方法显著降低错误并保持OCR准确性。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal
> reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not
> grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously
> overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or
> textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits
> of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging
> Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We
> further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that
> hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing
> the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA
> demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector
> dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving
> OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic
> priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular
> logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.
> Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation
> insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as
> promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.
