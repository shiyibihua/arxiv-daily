## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Missing entries in multi dimensional data pose significant challenges for
> downstream analysis across diverse real world applications. These data are
> naturally modeled as tensors, and recent completion methods integrating global
> low rank priors with plug and play denoisers have demonstrated strong empirical
> performance. However, these approaches often rely on empirical convergence
> alone or unrealistic assumptions, such as deep denoisers acting as proximal
> operators of implicit regularizers, which generally does not hold. To address
> these limitations, we propose a novel tensor completion framework grounded in
> the monotone inclusion paradigm, which unifies generalized low rank priors with
> deep pseudo contractive denoisers and extends beyond traditional convex
> optimization. Building on the Davis Yin splitting scheme, we develop the GTCTV
> DPC algorithm and rigorously establish its global convergence. Extensive
> experiments demonstrate that GTCTV DPC consistently outperforms existing
> methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, particularly at low
> sampling rates.
