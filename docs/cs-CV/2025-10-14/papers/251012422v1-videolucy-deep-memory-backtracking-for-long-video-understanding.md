## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language
> models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a
> promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face
> two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on
> individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive
> frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt
> sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome
> these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework
> for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from
> coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with
> progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and
> temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an
> agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines
> video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is
> gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal
> understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In
> addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.
> EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand
> complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in
> extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
> VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms
> state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,
> achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as
> GPT-4o. Our code and dataset will be made publicly at
> https://videolucy.github.io
