## 💡 一句话要点

**提出自监督选择性引导扩散模型以解决老照片人脸修复中的复合退化问题**

**关键词**: `人脸修复` `扩散模型` `自监督学习` `选择性引导` `老照片处理` `图像增强`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 老照片人脸修复面临破损、褪色和严重模糊等复合退化挑战
2. 利用弱引导生成伪参考人脸，通过结构引导和颜色精炼实现区域选择性修复
3. 在自建基准上，SSDiff在感知质量、保真度和区域可控性方面优于现有方法

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
> degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
> diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
> statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
> propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
> pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
> guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
> colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
> guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
> steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
> face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
> regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
> 300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
> SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
> quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:
