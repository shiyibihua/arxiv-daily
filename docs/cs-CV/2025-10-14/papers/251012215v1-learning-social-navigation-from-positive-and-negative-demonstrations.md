## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Mobile robot navigation in dynamic human environments requires policies that
> balance adaptability to diverse behaviors with compliance to safety
> constraints. We hypothesize that integrating data-driven rewards with
> rule-based objectives enables navigation policies to achieve a more effective
> balance of adaptability and safety. To this end, we develop a framework that
> learns a density-based reward from positive and negative demonstrations and
> augments it with rule-based objectives for obstacle avoidance and goal
> reaching. A sampling-based lookahead controller produces supervisory actions
> that are both safe and adaptive, which are subsequently distilled into a
> compact student policy suitable for real-time operation with uncertainty
> estimates. Experiments in synthetic and elevator co-boarding simulations show
> consistent gains in success rate and time efficiency over baselines, and
> real-world demonstrations with human participants confirm the practicality of
> deployment. A video illustrating this work can be found on our project page
