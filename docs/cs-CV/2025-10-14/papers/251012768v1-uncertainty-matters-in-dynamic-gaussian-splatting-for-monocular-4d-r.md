## 💡 一句话要点

**提出USplat4D框架，通过不确定性建模提升单目4D动态重建质量**

**关键词**: `动态高斯泼溅` `不确定性建模` `单目4D重建` `时空图优化` `运动漂移抑制`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：单目动态3D重建存在遮挡和极端视角下的模糊性，导致运动漂移和合成质量下降。
2. 方法要点：引入时间变化的高斯不确定性估计，构建时空图进行不确定性感知优化。
3. 实验或效果：在真实和合成数据集上验证，模型在遮挡下几何更稳定，极端视角合成质量高。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally
> under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel
> views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,
> vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether
> they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under
> occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue
> that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views
> and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited
> visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a
> novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates
> reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to
> estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a
> spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on
> diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty
> consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable
> geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.
