## 📄 摘要（原文）

> With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),
> remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning
> (CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three
> conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation
> shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise
> sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the
> Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address
> these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet
> efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)
> network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a
> lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each
> incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new
> classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the
> current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a
> result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different
> incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable
> comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the
> Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and
> negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This
> decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the
> feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between
> stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across
> all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL
> consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire
> CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference
> phases.
