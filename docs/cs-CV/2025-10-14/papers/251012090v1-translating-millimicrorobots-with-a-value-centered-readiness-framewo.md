## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Untethered mobile milli/microrobots hold transformative potential for
> interventional medicine by enabling more precise and entirely non-invasive
> diagnosis and therapy. Realizing this promise requires bridging the gap between
> groundbreaking laboratory demonstrations and successful clinical integration.
> Despite remarkable technical progress over the past two decades, most
> millirobots and microrobots remain confined to laboratory proof-of-concept
> demonstrations, with limited real-world feasibility. In this Review, we
> identify key factors that slow translation from bench to bedside, focusing on
> the disconnect between technical innovation and real-world application. We
> argue that the long-term impact and sustainability of the field depend on
> aligning development with unmet medical needs, ensuring applied feasibility,
> and integrating seamlessly into existing clinical workflows, which are
> essential pillars for delivering meaningful patient outcomes. To support this
> shift, we introduce a strategic milli/microrobot Technology Readiness Level
> framework (mTRL), which maps system development from initial conceptualization
> to clinical adoption through clearly defined milestones and their associated
> stepwise activities. The mTRL model provides a structured gauge of
> technological maturity, a common language for cross-disciplinary collaboration
> and actionable guidance to accelerate translational development toward new,
> safer and more efficient interventions.
