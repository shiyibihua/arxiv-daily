## 💡 一句话要点

**提出乘法损失函数以增强医学和细胞图像语义分割的鲁棒性**

**关键词**: `语义分割` `损失函数` `医学图像` `细胞图像` `数据稀缺` `梯度调制`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 医学图像数据稀缺，传统损失函数超参数敏感且性能不佳
2. 乘法损失结合交叉熵和Dice损失，动态调整梯度以稳定优化
3. 实验表明在数据稀缺场景下优于现有损失函数，无需超参数调优

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and
> Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical
> and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used,
> their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs
> suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data
> scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and
> efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy
> and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on
> prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions
> and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing
> optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies
> a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating
> predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.
> This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients
> when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation
> benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and
> existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free
> mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.
