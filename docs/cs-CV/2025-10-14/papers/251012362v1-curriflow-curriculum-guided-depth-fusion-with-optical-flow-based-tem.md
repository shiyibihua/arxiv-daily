## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and
> semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for
> camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods
> relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion
> reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose
> CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates
> optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion.
> CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual,
> and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby
> improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance
> geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions
> from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during
> training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world
> deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
> provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic
> learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark
> demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
> IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and
> curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.
