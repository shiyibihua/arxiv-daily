## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Multimodal embedding models aim to yield informative unified representations
> that empower diverse cross-modal tasks. Despite promising developments in the
> evolution from CLIP-based dual-tower architectures to large vision-language
> models, prior works still face unavoidable challenges in real-world
> applications and business scenarios, such as the limited modality support,
> unstable training mechanisms, and industrial domain gaps. In this work, we
> introduce SAIL-Embedding, an omni-modal embedding foundation model that
> addresses these issues through tailored training strategies and architectural
> design. In the optimization procedure, we propose a multi-stage training scheme
> to boost the multifaceted effectiveness of representation learning.
> Specifically, the content-aware progressive training aims to enhance the
> model's adaptability to diverse downstream tasks and master enriched
> cross-modal proficiency. The collaboration-aware recommendation enhancement
> training further adapts multimodal representations for recommendation scenarios
> by distilling knowledge from sequence-to-item and ID-to-item embeddings while
> mining user historical interests. Concurrently, we develop the stochastic
> specialization and dataset-driven pattern matching to strengthen model training
> flexibility and generalizability. Experimental results show that SAIL-Embedding
> achieves SOTA performance compared to other methods in different retrieval
> tasks. In online experiments across various real-world scenarios integrated
> with our model, we observe a significant increase in Lifetime (LT), which is a
> crucial indicator for the recommendation experience. For instance, the model
> delivers the 7-day LT gain of +0.158% and the 14-day LT gain of +0.144% in the
> Douyin-Selected scenario. For the Douyin feed rank model, the match features
> produced by SAIL-Embedding yield a +0.08% AUC gain.
