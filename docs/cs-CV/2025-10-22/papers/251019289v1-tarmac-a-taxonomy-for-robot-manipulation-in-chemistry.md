## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Chemistry laboratory automation aims to increase throughput, reproducibility,
> and safety, yet many existing systems still depend on frequent human
> intervention. Advances in robotics have reduced this dependency, but without a
> structured representation of the required skills, autonomy remains limited to
> bespoke, task-specific solutions with little capacity to transfer beyond their
> initial design. Current experiment abstractions typically describe
> protocol-level steps without specifying the robotic actions needed to execute
> them. This highlights the lack of a systematic account of the manipulation
> skills required for robots in chemistry laboratories. To address this gap, we
> introduce TARMAC - a Taxonomy for Robot Manipulation in Chemistry - a
> domain-specific framework that defines and organizes the core manipulations
> needed in laboratory practice. Based on annotated teaching-lab demonstrations
> and supported by experimental validation, TARMAC categorizes actions according
> to their functional role and physical execution requirements. Beyond serving as
> a descriptive vocabulary, TARMAC can be instantiated as robot-executable
> primitives and composed into higher-level macros, enabling skill reuse and
> supporting scalable integration into long-horizon workflows. These
> contributions provide a structured foundation for more flexible and autonomous
> laboratory automation. More information is available at
