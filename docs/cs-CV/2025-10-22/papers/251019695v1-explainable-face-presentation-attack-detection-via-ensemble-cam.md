## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
> use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
> unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
> (PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
> mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
> models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
> purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
> the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
> explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
> DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
> image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
> technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
> decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
> DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
> behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
> trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.
