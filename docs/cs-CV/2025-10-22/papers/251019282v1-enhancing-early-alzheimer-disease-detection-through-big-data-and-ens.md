## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Alzheimer disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various
> brain areas and leads to memory damage. The limited availability of labeled
> medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease
> detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the
> accuracy of Alzheimer disease detection, considering the scarcity of labeled
> data, the complexity of the disease, and the constraints related to data
> privacy. To address this challenge, our study leverages the power of big data
> in the form of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the
> framework of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and ensemble learning. We propose an
> ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method
> in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration
> enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach
> also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a
> more precise classification of Alzheimer disease progression levels. The
> effectiveness of our method was evaluated using two datasets, the Kaggle
> Alzheimer dataset and the ADNI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99.72% and
> 99.86%, respectively. The comparison of our results with relevant
> state-of-the-art studies demonstrated that our approach achieved superior
> accuracy and highlighted its validity and potential for real-world applications
> in early Alzheimer disease detection.
