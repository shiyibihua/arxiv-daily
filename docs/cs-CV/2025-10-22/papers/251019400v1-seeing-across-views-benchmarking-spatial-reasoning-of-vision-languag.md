## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
> to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
> foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
> evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
> integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
> setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
> complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
> VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
> therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
> MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
> spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
> consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
> two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
> evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
> closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
> techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
> human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
> multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
> findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
> correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
> existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
> reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
> benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
> spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
> standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.
