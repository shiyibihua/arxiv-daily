## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling
> the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective
> preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen
> science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and
> completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by
> using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence
> across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura)
> by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the
> "EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing
> significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error
> (MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key
> environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while
> maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating
> land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual
> models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of
> image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification,
> achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the
> potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as
> balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data
> are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable
> biodiversity monitoring.
