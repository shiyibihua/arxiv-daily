## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
> analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
> and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
> overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
> anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
> Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
> regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
> approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
> modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
> transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
> regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
> non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves
> both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility
