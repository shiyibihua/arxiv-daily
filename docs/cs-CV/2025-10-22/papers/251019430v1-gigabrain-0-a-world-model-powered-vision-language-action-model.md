## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for generalist robots typically
> requires large-scale real-world robot data, which is expensive and
> time-consuming to collect. The inefficiency of physical data collection
> severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA
> systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA
> foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video
> generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real
> transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale,
> GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving
> cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness
> through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision,
> enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and
> long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial
> gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile
> manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves
> superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures,
> colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present
> GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently
> on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.
