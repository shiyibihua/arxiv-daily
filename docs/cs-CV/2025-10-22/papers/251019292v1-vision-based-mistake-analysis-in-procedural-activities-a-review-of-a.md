## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Mistake analysis in procedural activities is a critical area of research with
> applications spanning industrial automation, physical rehabilitation, education
> and human-robot collaboration. This paper reviews vision-based methods for
> detecting and predicting mistakes in structured tasks, focusing on procedural
> and executional errors. By leveraging advancements in computer vision,
> including action recognition, anticipation and activity understanding,
> vision-based systems can identify deviations in task execution, such as
> incorrect sequencing, use of improper techniques, or timing errors. We explore
> the challenges posed by intra-class variability, viewpoint differences and
> compositional activity structures, which complicate mistake detection.
> Additionally, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing datasets,
> evaluation metrics and state-of-the-art methods, categorizing approaches based
> on their use of procedural structure, supervision levels and learning
> strategies. Open challenges, such as distinguishing permissible variations from
> true mistakes and modeling error propagation are discussed alongside future
> directions, including neuro-symbolic reasoning and counterfactual state
> modeling. This work aims to establish a unified perspective on vision-based
> mistake analysis in procedural activities, highlighting its potential to
> enhance safety, efficiency and task performance across diverse domains.
