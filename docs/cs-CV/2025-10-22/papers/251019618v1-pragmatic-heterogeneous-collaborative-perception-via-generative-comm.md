## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
> agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
> differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
> to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
> and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
> two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
> disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
> accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
> To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
> mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
> multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
> network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
> efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
> Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
> collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
> Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
> generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
> the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
> further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
> the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
> outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
> both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
> code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.
