## 📄 摘要（原文）

> 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
> sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
> and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
> detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
> geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
> introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
> by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
> image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
> representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
> of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
> image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
> view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
> spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
> dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
> radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
> cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
> features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
> are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
> Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
> features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
> (VoD) object detection benchmarks.
