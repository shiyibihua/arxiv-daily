3. 实验或效果：通过敏感性分析识别对丢失风险影响最大的因素

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The growing interest in ocean discovery imposes a need for inspection and
> intervention in confined and demanding environments. Eely's slender shape, in
> addition to its ability to change its body configurations, makes articulated
> underwater robots an adequate option for such environments. However, operation
> of Eely in such environments imposes demanding requirements on the system, as
> it must deal with uncertain and unstructured environments, extreme
> environmental conditions, and reduced navigational capabilities. This paper
> proposes a Bayesian approach to assess the risks of losing Eely during two
> mission scenarios. The goal of this work is to improve Eely's performance and
> the likelihood of mission success. Sensitivity analysis results are presented
> in order to demonstrate the causes having the highest impact on losing Eely.
