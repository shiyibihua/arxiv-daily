## 💡 一句话要点

**提出Cauvis方法以解决单源域泛化目标检测中的伪相关性问题**

**关键词**: `单源域泛化目标检测` `因果视觉提示` `跨注意力机制` `特征解耦` `高频特征提取` `鲁棒性增强`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：模型在单源域训练中易陷入伪相关，过度依赖颜色等浅层特征而非轮廓等不变表示。
2. 方法要点：引入跨注意力提示模块和双分支适配器，解耦因果-伪特征并提取高频特征实现域适应。
3. 实验或效果：在SDGOD数据集上性能提升15.9-31.4%，并在复杂干扰环境中展现强鲁棒性。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
> research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
> capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
> Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
> augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
> domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
> correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
> classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
> representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
> propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
> Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
> integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
> domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
> for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
> disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
> high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
> with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
> datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
> interference environments.
