## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The integration of advanced control strategies into prosthetic hands is
> essential to improve their adaptability and performance. In this study, we
> present an implementation of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy to
> regulate the motions of a soft continuum wrist section attached to a
> tendon-driven prosthetic hand with less computational effort. MPC plays a
> crucial role in enhancing the functionality and responsiveness of prosthetic
> hands. By leveraging predictive modeling, this approach enables precise
> movement adjustments while accounting for dynamic user interactions. This
> advanced control strategy allows for the anticipation of future movements and
> adjustments based on the current state of the prosthetic device and the
> intentions of the user. Kinematic and dynamic modelings are performed using
> Euler-Bernoulli beam and Lagrange methods respectively. Through simulation and
> experimental validations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MPC in optimizing
> wrist articulation and user control. Our findings suggest that this technique
> significantly improves the prosthetic hand dexterity, making movements more
> natural and intuitive. This research contributes to the field of robotics and
> biomedical engineering by offering a promising direction for intelligent
> prosthetic systems.
