**关键词**: `时刻检索` `两阶段学习` `数据增强` `蒸馏训练` `边界检测` `语义区分`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有方法面临数据稀缺、边界模糊和细粒度语义区分不足的瓶颈。
2. 方法要点：采用两阶段训练，冷启动阶段增强边界和语义感知，蒸馏阶段通过双查询集实现泛化。
3. 实验或效果：在多个基准测试中，AMR性能优于先前最先进方法。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
> scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
> ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
> discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
> ``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
> Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
> caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
> semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
> it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
> annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
> it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
> training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
> performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
> cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
> learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
> The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
> DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
> while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
> cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
> Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
> generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
> improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.
