## 💡 一句话要点

**分析提示复杂度对T2I模型合成数据质量、多样性和一致性的影响**

**关键词**: `文本到图像模型` `合成数据评估` `提示复杂度` `分布偏移` `推理时干预` `提示扩展`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：提示复杂度对T2I模型合成数据效用（质量、多样性、一致性）的系统影响未充分研究。
2. 方法要点：引入新评估框架，比较真实与合成数据效用，并进行大规模实验分析。
3. 实验或效果：增加提示复杂度降低条件多样性和提示一致性，但减少分布偏移；提示扩展方法表现最佳。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
> limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
> datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
> on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
> engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
> impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
> underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
> motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
> the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
> evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
> data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
> the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
> our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
> evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
> experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
> the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
> learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
> increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
> consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
> aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
> interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
> moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
> expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
> estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
> diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.
