## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
> at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
> the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
> localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
> high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
> To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
> introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
> forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
> maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
> forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
> inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
> Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
> inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
> introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
> designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
> manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
> datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
> state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
> deployment.
