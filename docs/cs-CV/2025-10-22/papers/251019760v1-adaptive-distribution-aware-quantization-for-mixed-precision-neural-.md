## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
> neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
> often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
> activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
> To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
> Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
> differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
> quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
> initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
> initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
> on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
> and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
> activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
> scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
> ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
> average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
> under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
> systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
> component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.
