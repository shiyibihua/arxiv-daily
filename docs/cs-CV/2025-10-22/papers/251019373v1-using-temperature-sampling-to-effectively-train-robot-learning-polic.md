## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Increasingly large datasets of robot actions and sensory observations are
> being collected to train ever-larger neural networks. These datasets are
> collected based on tasks and while these tasks may be distinct in their
> descriptions, many involve very similar physical action sequences (e.g., 'pick
> up an apple' versus 'pick up an orange'). As a result, many datasets of robotic
> tasks are substantially imbalanced in terms of the physical robotic actions
> they represent. In this work, we propose a simple sampling strategy for policy
> training that mitigates this imbalance. Our method requires only a few lines of
> code to integrate into existing codebases and improves generalization. We
> evaluate our method in both pre-training small models and fine-tuning large
> foundational models. Our results show substantial improvements on low-resource
> tasks compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, without degrading performance
> on high-resource tasks. This enables more effective use of model capacity for
> multi-task policies. We also further validate our approach in a real-world
> setup on a Franka Panda robot arm across a diverse set of tasks.
