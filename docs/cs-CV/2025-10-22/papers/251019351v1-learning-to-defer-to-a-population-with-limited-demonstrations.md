## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper addresses the critical data scarcity that hinders the practical
> deployment of learning to defer (L2D) systems to the population. We introduce a
> context-aware, semi-supervised framework that uses meta-learning to generate
> expert-specific embeddings from only a few demonstrations. We demonstrate the
> efficacy of a dual-purpose mechanism, where these embeddings are used first to
> generate a large corpus of pseudo-labels for training, and subsequently to
> enable on-the-fly adaptation to new experts at test-time. The experiment
> results on three different datasets confirm that a model trained on these
> synthetic labels rapidly approaches oracle-level performance, validating the
> data efficiency of our approach. By resolving a key training bottleneck, this
> work makes adaptive L2D systems more practical and scalable, paving the way for
> human-AI collaboration in real-world environments. To facilitate
> reproducibility and address implementation details not covered in the main
> text, we provide our source code and training configurations at
