## 💡 一句话要点

**提出基于相对表面法线的新指标以改进单目深度估计评估**

**关键词**: `单目深度估计` `评估指标` `表面法线` `扰动分析` `人类对齐`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有单目深度估计评估指标缺乏标准化，对扰动敏感度不足。
2. 方法要点：引入相对表面法线指标和可视化工具，提升与人类判断对齐。
3. 实验或效果：分析显示现有指标对曲率扰动不敏感，新指标改善评估效果。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
> to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
> standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
> metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
> contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
> their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
> emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
> metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
> flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
> surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
> method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data
> are available at: https://github.com/princeton-vl/evalmde.
