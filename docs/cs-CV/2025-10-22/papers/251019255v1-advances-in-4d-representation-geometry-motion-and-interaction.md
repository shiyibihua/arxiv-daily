## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
> subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
> advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
> generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
> of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
> perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
> while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
> exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
> focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
> ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
> application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
> the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
> representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
> representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
> Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
> today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
> but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
> context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
> survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
> foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
> discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
> also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
> as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project
