## 📄 摘要（原文）

> A sensor has the ability to probe its surroundings. However, uncertainties in
> its exact location can significantly compromise its sensing performance. The
> radius of robust feasibility defines the maximum range within which robust
> feasibility is ensured. This work introduces a novel approach integrating it
> with the directional sensor networks to enhance coverage using a distributed
> greedy algorithm. In particular, we provide an exact formula for the radius of
> robust feasibility of sensors in a directional sensor network. The proposed
> model strategically orients the sensors in regions with high coverage
> potential, accounting for robustness in the face of uncertainty. We analyze the
> algorithm's adaptability in dynamic environments, demonstrating its ability to
> enhance efficiency and robustness. Experimental results validate its efficacy
> in maximizing coverage and optimizing sensor orientations, highlighting its
> practical advantages for real-world scenarios.
