## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic
> segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty
> for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image
> classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While
> most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical
> imaging, this work benchmarks existing methods specifically for remote sensing
> and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical
> utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction
> errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on
> two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences
> in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive
> evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks
> and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and
> uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our
> findings.
