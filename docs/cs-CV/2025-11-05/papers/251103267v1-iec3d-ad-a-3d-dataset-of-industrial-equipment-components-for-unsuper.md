## 📄 摘要（原文）

> 3D anomaly detection (3D-AD) plays a critical role in industrial
> manufacturing, particularly in ensuring the reliability and safety of core
> equipment components. Although existing 3D datasets like Real3D-AD and MVTec
> 3D-AD offer broad application support, they fall short in capturing the
> complexities and subtle defects found in real industrial environments. This
> limitation hampers precise anomaly detection research, especially for
> industrial equipment components (IEC) such as bearings, rings, and bolts. To
> address this challenge, we have developed a point cloud anomaly detection
> dataset (IEC3D-AD) specific to real industrial scenarios. This dataset is
> directly collected from actual production lines, ensuring high fidelity and
> relevance. Compared to existing datasets, IEC3D-AD features significantly
> improved point cloud resolution and defect annotation granularity, facilitating
> more demanding anomaly detection tasks. Furthermore, inspired by generative
> 2D-AD methods, we introduce a novel 3D-AD paradigm (GMANet) on IEC3D-AD. This
> paradigm generates synthetic point cloud samples based on geometric
> morphological analysis, then reduces the margin and increases the overlap
> between normal and abnormal point-level features through spatial discrepancy
> optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
> on both IEC3D-AD and other datasets.
