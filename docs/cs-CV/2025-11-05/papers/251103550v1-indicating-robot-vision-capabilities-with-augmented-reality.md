## 💡 一句话要点

**提出增强现实视场指示器以解决人机协作中人类对机器人视觉能力的误判问题**

**关键词**: `增强现实` `机器人视觉` `人机协作` `视场指示` `用户实验` `认知负荷`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：人类常误以为机器人视场与人类相同，导致协作失败。
2. 方法要点：设计四种增强现实视场指示器，涵盖自我中心到任务中心视角。
3. 实验或效果：用户实验显示任务中心指示器准确率最高，参与者信心高且认知负荷低。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Research indicates that humans can mistakenly assume that robots and humans
> have the same field of view (FoV), possessing an inaccurate mental model of
> robots. This misperception may lead to failures during human-robot
> collaboration tasks where robots might be asked to complete impossible tasks
> about out-of-view objects. The issue is more severe when robots do not have a
> chance to scan the scene to update their world model while focusing on assigned
> tasks. To help align humans' mental models of robots' vision capabilities, we
> propose four FoV indicators in augmented reality (AR) and conducted a user
> human-subjects experiment (N=41) to evaluate them in terms of accuracy,
> confidence, task efficiency, and workload. These indicators span a spectrum
> from egocentric (robot's eye and head space) to allocentric (task space).
> Results showed that the allocentric blocks at the task space had the highest
> accuracy with a delay in interpreting the robot's FoV. The egocentric indicator
> of deeper eye sockets, possible for physical alteration, also increased
> accuracy. In all indicators, participants' confidence was high while cognitive
> load remained low. Finally, we contribute six guidelines for practitioners to
> apply our AR indicators or physical alterations to align humans' mental models
> with robots' vision capabilities.
