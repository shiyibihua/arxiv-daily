## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Social anxiety is a prevalent mental health condition that can significantly
> impact overall well-being and quality of life. Despite its widespread effects,
> adequate support or treatment for social anxiety is often insufficient.
> Advances in technology, particularly in social robotics, offer promising
> opportunities to complement traditional mental health. As an initial step
> toward developing effective solutions, it is essential to understand the values
> that shape what is considered meaningful, acceptable, and helpful. In this
> study, a participatory design workshop was conducted with mental health
> academic researchers to elicit the underlying values that should inform the
> design of socially assistive robots for social anxiety support. Through
> creative, reflective, and envisioning activities, participants explored
> scenarios and design possibilities, allowing for systematic elicitation of
> values, expectations, needs, and preferences related to robot-supported
> interventions. The findings reveal rich insights into design-relevant
> values-including adaptivity, acceptance, and efficacy-that are core to support
> for individuals with social anxiety. This study highlights the significance of
> a research-led approach to value elicitation, emphasising user-centred and
> context-aware design considerations in the development of socially assistive
> robots.
