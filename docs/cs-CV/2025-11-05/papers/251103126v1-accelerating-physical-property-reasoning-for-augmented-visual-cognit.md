## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper introduces \sysname, a system that accelerates vision-guided
> physical property reasoning to enable augmented visual cognition. \sysname
> minimizes the run-time latency of this reasoning pipeline through a combination
> of both algorithmic and systematic optimizations, including rapid geometric 3D
> reconstruction, efficient semantic feature fusion, and parallel view encoding.
> Through these simple yet effective optimizations, \sysname reduces the
> end-to-end latency of this reasoning pipeline from 10--20 minutes to less than
> 6 seconds. A head-to-head comparison on the ABO dataset shows that \sysname
> achieves this 62.9$\times$--287.2$\times$ speedup while not only reaching
> on-par (and sometimes slightly better) object-level physical property
> estimation accuracy(e.g. mass), but also demonstrating superior performance in
> material segmentation and voxel-level inference than two SOTA baselines. We
> further combine gaze-tracking with \sysname to localize the object of interest
> in cluttered, real-world environments, streamlining the physical property
> reasoning on smart glasses. The case study with Meta Aria Glasses conducted at
> an IKEA furniture store demonstrates that \sysname achives consistently high
> performance compared to controlled captures, providing robust property
> estimations even with fewer views in real-world scenarios.
