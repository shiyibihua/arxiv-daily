## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The human hand plays a vital role in daily life and industrial applications,
> yet replicating its multifunctional capabilities-including motion, sensing, and
> coordinated manipulation-with robotic systems remains a formidable challenge.
> Developing a dexterous robotic hand requires balancing human-like agility with
> engineering constraints such as complexity, size-to-weight ratio, durability,
> and force-sensing performance. This letter presents Dex-Hand 021, a
> high-performance, cable-driven five-finger robotic hand with 12 active and 7
> passive degrees of freedom (DoFs), achieving 19 DoFs dexterity in a lightweight
> 1 kg design. We propose a proprioceptive force-sensing-based admittance control
> method to enhance manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate its superior
> performance: a single-finger load capacity exceeding 10 N, fingertip
> repeatability under 0.001 m, and force estimation errors below 0.2 N. Compared
> to PID control, joint torques in multi-object grasping are reduced by 31.19%,
> significantly improves force-sensing capability while preventing overload
> during collisions. The hand excels in both power and precision grasps,
> successfully executing 33 GRASP taxonomy motions and complex manipulation
> tasks. This work advances the design of lightweight, industrial-grade dexterous
> hands and enhances proprioceptive control, contributing to robotic manipulation
> and intelligent manufacturing.
