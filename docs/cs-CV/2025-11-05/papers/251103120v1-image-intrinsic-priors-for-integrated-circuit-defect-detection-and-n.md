## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Integrated circuit manufacturing is highly complex, comprising hundreds of
> process steps. Defects can arise at any stage, causing yield loss and
> ultimately degrading product reliability. Supervised methods require extensive
> human annotation and struggle with emergent categories and rare, data scarce
> defects. Clustering-based unsupervised methods often exhibit unstable
> performance due to missing priors. We propose IC DefectNCD, a support set free
> framework that leverages Image Intrinsic Priors in IC SEM images for defect
> detection and novel class discovery. We first develop Self Normal Information
> Guided IC Defect Detection, aggregating representative normal features via a
> learnable normal information extractor and using reconstruction residuals to
> coarsely localize defect regions. To handle saliency variations across defects,
> we introduce an adaptive binarization strategy that produces stable subimages
> focused on core defective areas. Finally, we design Self Defect Information
> Guided IC Defect Classification, which incorporates a soft mask guided
> attention mechanism to inject spatial defect priors into the teacher student
> model. This enhances sensitivity to defective regions, suppresses background
> interference, and enables recognition and classification of unseen defects. We
> validate the approach on a real world dataset spanning three key fabrication
> stages and covering 15 defect types. Experiments demonstrate robust performance
> on both defect detection and unseen defect classification.
