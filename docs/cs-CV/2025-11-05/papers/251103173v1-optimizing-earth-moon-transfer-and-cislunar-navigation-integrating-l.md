## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The rapid growth of cislunar activities, including lunar landings, the Lunar
> Gateway, and in-space refueling stations, requires advances in cost-efficient
> trajectory design and reliable integration of navigation and remote sensing.
> Traditional Earth-Moon transfers suffer from rigid launch windows and high
> propellant demands, while Earth-based GNSS systems provide little to no
> coverage beyond geostationary orbit. This limits autonomy and environmental
> awareness in cislunar space. This review compares four major transfer
> strategies by evaluating velocity requirements, flight durations, and fuel
> efficiency, and by identifying their suitability for both crewed and robotic
> missions. The emerging role of artificial intelligence and machine learning is
> highlighted: convolutional neural networks support automated crater recognition
> and digital terrain model generation, while deep reinforcement learning enables
> adaptive trajectory refinement during descent and landing to reduce risk and
> decision latency. The study also examines how GNSS-Reflectometry and advanced
> Positioning, Navigation, and Timing architectures can extend navigation
> capabilities beyond current limits. GNSS-R can act as a bistatic radar for
> mapping lunar ice, soil properties, and surface topography, while PNT systems
> support autonomous rendezvous, Lagrange point station-keeping, and coordinated
> satellite swarm operations. Combining these developments establishes a scalable
> framework for sustainable cislunar exploration and long-term human and robotic
> presence.
