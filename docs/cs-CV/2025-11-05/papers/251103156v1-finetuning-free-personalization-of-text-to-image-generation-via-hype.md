## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models has traditionally relied on
> subject-specific fine-tuning approaches such as
> DreamBooth~\cite{ruiz2023dreambooth}, which are computationally expensive and
> slow at inference. Recent adapter- and encoder-based methods attempt to reduce
> this overhead but still depend on additional fine-tuning or large backbone
> models for satisfactory results. In this work, we revisit an orthogonal
> direction: fine-tuning-free personalization via Hypernetworks that predict
> LoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images. Prior hypernetwork-based
> approaches, however, suffer from costly data generation or unstable attempts to
> mimic base model optimization trajectories. We address these limitations with
> an end-to-end training objective, stabilized by a simple output regularization,
> yielding reliable and effective hypernetworks. Our method removes the need for
> per-subject optimization at test time while preserving both subject fidelity
> and prompt alignment. To further enhance compositional generalization at
> inference time, we introduce Hybrid-Model Classifier-Free Guidance (HM-CFG),
> which combines the compositional strengths of the base diffusion model with the
> subject fidelity of personalized models during sampling. Extensive experiments
> on CelebA-HQ, AFHQ-v2, and DreamBench demonstrate that our approach achieves
> strong personalization performance and highlights the promise of hypernetworks
> as a scalable and effective direction for open-category personalization.
