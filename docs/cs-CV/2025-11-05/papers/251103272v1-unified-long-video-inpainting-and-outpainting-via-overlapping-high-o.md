## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Generating long videos remains a fundamental challenge, and achieving high
> controllability in video inpainting and outpainting is particularly demanding.
> To address both of these challenges simultaneously and achieve controllable
> video inpainting and outpainting for long video clips, we introduce a novel and
> unified approach for long video inpainting and outpainting that extends
> text-to-video diffusion models to generate arbitrarily long, spatially edited
> videos with high fidelity. Our method leverages LoRA to efficiently fine-tune a
> large pre-trained video diffusion model like Alibaba's Wan 2.1 for masked
> region video synthesis, and employs an overlap-and-blend temporal co-denoising
> strategy with high-order solvers to maintain consistency across long sequences.
> In contrast to prior work that struggles with fixed-length clips or exhibits
> stitching artifacts, our system enables arbitrarily long video generation and
> editing without noticeable seams or drift. We validate our approach on
> challenging inpainting/outpainting tasks including editing or adding objects
> over hundreds of frames and demonstrate superior performance to baseline
> methods like Wan 2.1 model and VACE in terms of quality (PSNR/SSIM), and
> perceptual realism (LPIPS). Our method enables practical long-range video
> editing with minimal overhead, achieved a balance between parameter efficient
> and superior performance.
