## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Accurately assessing the risk of cesarean section (CS) delivery is critical,
> especially in settings with limited medical resources, where access to
> healthcare is often restricted. Early and reliable risk prediction allows
> better-informed prenatal care decisions and can improve maternal and neonatal
> outcomes. However, most existing predictive models are tailored for in-hospital
> use during labor and rely on parameters that are often unavailable in
> resource-limited or home-based settings. In this study, we conduct a pilot
> investigation to examine the feasibility of using 3D body shape for CS risk
> assessment for future applications with more affordable general devices. We
> propose a novel multi-view-based Transformer network, MvBody, which predicts CS
> risk using only self-reported medical data and 3D optical body scans obtained
> between the 31st and 38th weeks of gestation. To enhance training efficiency
> and model generalizability in data-scarce environments, we incorporate a metric
> learning loss into the network. Compared to widely used machine learning models
> and the latest advanced 3D analysis methods, our method demonstrates superior
> performance, achieving an accuracy of 84.62% and an Area Under the Receiver
> Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.724 on the independent test set.
> To improve transparency and trust in the model's predictions, we apply the
> Integrated Gradients algorithm to provide theoretically grounded explanations
> of the model's decision-making process. Our results indicate that pre-pregnancy
> weight, maternal age, obstetric history, previous CS history, and body shape,
> particularly around the head and shoulders, are key contributors to CS risk
> prediction.
