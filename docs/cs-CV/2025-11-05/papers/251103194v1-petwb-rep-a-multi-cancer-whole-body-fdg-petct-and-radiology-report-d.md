## 💡 一句话要点

**提出PETWB-REP多癌种全身PET/CT与报告数据集以支持医学影像与AI研究**

**关键词**: `医学影像数据集` `PET/CT扫描` `放射学报告` `多癌种研究` `多模态学习` `人工智能应用`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：多癌种医学影像数据集稀缺，缺乏功能与解剖成像结合临床报告
2. 方法要点：构建490患者多癌种全身FDG PET/CT扫描与配对放射学报告数据集
3. 实验或效果：未知，数据集旨在支持影像、放射组学、AI及多模态学习研究

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Publicly available, large-scale medical imaging datasets are crucial for
> developing and validating artificial intelligence models and conducting
> retrospective clinical research. However, datasets that combine functional and
> anatomical imaging with detailed clinical reports across multiple cancer types
> remain scarce. Here, we present PETWB-REP, a curated dataset comprising
> whole-body 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography/Computed
> Tomography (PET/CT) scans and corresponding radiology reports from 490 patients
> diagnosed with various malignancies. The dataset primarily includes common
> cancers such as lung cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and
> ovarian cancer. This dataset includes paired PET and CT images, de-identified
> textual reports, and structured clinical metadata. It is designed to support
> research in medical imaging, radiomics, artificial intelligence, and
> multi-modal learning.
