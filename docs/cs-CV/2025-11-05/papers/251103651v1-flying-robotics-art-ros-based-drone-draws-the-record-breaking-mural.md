## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper presents the innovative design and successful deployment of a
> pioneering autonomous unmanned aerial system developed for executing the
> world's largest mural painted by a drone. Addressing the dual challenges of
> maintaining artistic precision and operational reliability under adverse
> outdoor conditions such as wind and direct sunlight, our work introduces a
> robust system capable of navigating and painting outdoors with unprecedented
> accuracy. Key to our approach is a novel navigation system that combines an
> infrared (IR) motion capture camera and LiDAR technology, enabling precise
> location tracking tailored specifically for largescale artistic applications.
> We employ a unique control architecture that uses different regulation in
> tangential and normal directions relative to the planned path, enabling precise
> trajectory tracking and stable line rendering. We also present algorithms for
> trajectory planning and path optimization, allowing for complex curve drawing
> and area filling. The system includes a custom-designed paint spraying
> mechanism, specifically engineered to function effectively amidst the turbulent
> airflow generated by the drone's propellers, which also protects the drone's
> critical components from paint-related damage, ensuring longevity and
> consistent performance. Experimental results demonstrate the system's
> robustness and precision in varied conditions, showcasing its potential for
> autonomous large-scale art creation and expanding the functional applications
> of robotics in creative fields.
