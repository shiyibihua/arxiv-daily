## 💡 一句话要点

**提出基于身体部位感知的自底向上群体推理框架，以解决细粒度社交交互检测问题。**

**关键词**: `社交交互检测` `细粒度分析` `身体部位感知` `自底向上推理` `群体推断` `人际关联`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 现有方法依赖整体个体表示，忽略细微社交线索，导致群体推断模糊。
2. 方法使用身体部位特征和人际关联，通过相似性推理推断社交群体和交互。
3. 在NVI数据集上实验，性能优于先前方法，达到新最优水平。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Social interactions often emerge from subtle, fine-grained cues such as
> facial expressions, gaze, and gestures. However, existing methods for social
> interaction detection overlook such nuanced cues and primarily rely on holistic
> representations of individuals. Moreover, they directly detect social groups
> without explicitly modeling the underlying interactions between individuals.
> These drawbacks limit their ability to capture localized social signals and
> introduce ambiguity when group configurations should be inferred from social
> interactions grounded in nuanced cues. In this work, we propose a part-aware
> bottom-up group reasoning framework for fine-grained social interaction
> detection. The proposed method infers social groups and their interactions
> using body part features and their interpersonal relations. Our model first
> detects individuals and enhances their features using part-aware cues, and then
> infers group configuration by associating individuals via similarity-based
> reasoning, which considers not only spatial relations but also subtle social
> cues that signal interactions, leading to more accurate group inference.
> Experiments on the NVI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms prior
> methods, achieving the new state of the art.
