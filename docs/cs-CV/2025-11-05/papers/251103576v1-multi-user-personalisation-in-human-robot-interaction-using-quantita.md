## 💡 一句话要点

**提出MUP-QBAF框架以解决人机交互中多用户偏好冲突**

**关键词**: `人机交互` `多用户个性化` `偏好冲突解决` `定量双极论证框架` `辅助机器人` `动态适应`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有HRI个性化方法多针对单用户，忽略多用户偏好冲突。
2. 方法要点：基于QBAF建模动态偏好，结合用户参数和机器人环境观察。
3. 实验或效果：通过辅助机器人案例验证，分析参数敏感性和上下文适应性。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> While personalisation in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has advanced
> significantly, most existing approaches focus on single-user adaptation,
> overlooking scenarios involving multiple stakeholders with potentially
> conflicting preferences. To address this, we propose the Multi-User Preferences
> Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (MUP-QBAF), a novel multi-user
> personalisation framework based on Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation
> Frameworks (QBAFs) that explicitly models and resolves multi-user preference
> conflicts. Unlike prior work in Argumentation Frameworks, which typically
> assumes static inputs, our approach is tailored to robotics: it incorporates
> both users' arguments and the robot's dynamic observations of the environment,
> allowing the system to adapt over time and respond to changing contexts.
> Preferences, both positive and negative, are represented as arguments whose
> strength is recalculated iteratively based on new information. The framework's
> properties and capabilities are presented and validated through a realistic
> case study, where an assistive robot mediates between the conflicting
> preferences of a caregiver and a care recipient during a frailty assessment
> task. This evaluation further includes a sensitivity analysis of argument base
> scores, demonstrating how preference outcomes can be shaped by user input and
> contextual observations. By offering a transparent, structured, and
> context-sensitive approach to resolving competing user preferences, this work
> advances the field of multi-user HRI. It provides a principled alternative to
> data-driven methods, enabling robots to navigate conflicts in real-world
> environments.
