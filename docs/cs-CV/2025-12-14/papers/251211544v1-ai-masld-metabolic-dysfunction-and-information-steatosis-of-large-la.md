## 💡 一句话要点

**提出AI-MASLD概念，揭示大语言模型在嘈杂临床叙述中提取信息时功能下降**

**关键词**: `大语言模型评估` `临床信息提取` `AI-MASLD` `医疗人工智能安全` `噪声鲁棒性`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：评估大语言模型从含噪声的临床主诉中提取核心医学信息的能力，并验证其是否表现出类似代谢功能障碍的功能衰退
2. 方法要点：采用横断面分析设计，基于标准化医学探针，测试GPT-4o等四款主流模型，模拟真实临床沟通环境
3. 实验或效果：所有模型均出现不同程度功能缺陷，极端噪声下多数模型功能崩溃，GPT-4o在肺栓塞风险评估中严重误判

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This study aims to simulate real-world clinical scenarios to systematically evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract core medical information from patient chief complaints laden with noise and redundancy, and to verify whether they exhibit a functional decline analogous to Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD). We employed a cross-sectional analysis design based on standardized medical probes, selecting four mainstream LLMs as research subjects: GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5, DeepSeek 3.1, and Qwen3-Max. An evaluation system comprising twenty medical probes across five core dimensions was used to simulate a genuine clinical communication environment. All probes had gold-standard answers defined by clinical experts and were assessed via a double-blind, inverse rating scale by two independent clinicians. The results show that all tested models exhibited functional defects to varying degrees, with Qwen3-Max demonstrating the best overall performance and Gemini 2.5 the worst. Under conditions of extreme noise, most models experienced a functional collapse. Notably, GPT-4o made a severe misjudgment in the risk assessment for pulmonary embolism (PE) secondary to deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This research is the first to empirically confirm that LLMs exhibit features resembling metabolic dysfunction when processing clinical information, proposing the innovative concept of "AI-Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (AI-MASLD)". These findings offer a crucial safety warning for the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, emphasizing that current LLMs must be used as auxiliary tools under human expert supervision, as there remains a significant gap between their theoretical knowledge and practical clinical application.
