## 📋 核心要点

1. 现有方法在可控光照下实现高质量面部捕捉，但野外捕获成本高且受限。
2. 采用混合逆渲染框架，先数据驱动转换图像，再模型优化，解决光照与材质分离问题。
3. 提出纹理网格光照模型，结合扩散先验优化，显著提升野外捕获质量，缩小与可控记录的差距。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Existing methods achieve high-quality facial appearance capture under controllable lighting, which increases capture cost and limits usability. We propose WildCap, a novel method for high-quality facial appearance capture from a smartphone video recorded in the wild. To disentangle high-quality reflectance from complex lighting effects in in-the-wild captures, we propose a novel hybrid inverse rendering framework. Specifically, we first apply a data-driven method, i.e., SwitchLight, to convert the captured images into more constrained conditions and then adopt model-based inverse rendering. However, unavoidable local artifacts in network predictions, such as shadow-baking, are non-physical and thus hinder accurate inverse rendering of lighting and material. To address this, we propose a novel texel grid lighting model to explain non-physical effects as clean albedo illuminated by local physical lighting. During optimization, we jointly sample a diffusion prior for reflectance maps and optimize the lighting, effectively resolving scale ambiguity between local lights and albedo. Our method achieves significantly better results than prior arts in the same capture setup, closing the quality gap between in-the-wild and controllable recordings by a large margin. Our code will be released \href{https://yxuhan.github.io/WildCap/index.html}{\textcolor{magenta}{here}}.
