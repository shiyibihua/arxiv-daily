## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Data augmentation is crucial for improving the robustness of face detection systems, especially under challenging conditions such as occlusion, illumination variation, and complex environments. Traditional copy paste augmentation often produces unrealistic composites due to inaccurate foreground extraction, inconsistent scene geometry, and mismatched background semantics. To address these limitations, we propose Depth Copy Paste, a multimodal and depth aware augmentation framework that generates diverse and physically consistent face detection training samples by copying full body person instances and pasting them into semantically compatible scenes. Our approach first employs BLIP and CLIP to jointly assess semantic and visual coherence, enabling automatic retrieval of the most suitable background images for the given foreground person. To ensure high quality foreground masks that preserve facial details, we integrate SAM3 for precise segmentation and Depth-Anything to extract only the non occluded visible person regions, preventing corrupted facial textures from being used in augmentation. For geometric realism, we introduce a depth guided sliding window placement mechanism that searches over the background depth map to identify paste locations with optimal depth continuity and scale alignment. The resulting composites exhibit natural depth relationships and improved visual plausibility. Extensive experiments show that Depth Copy Paste provides more diverse and realistic training data, leading to significant performance improvements in downstream face detection tasks compared with traditional copy paste and depth free augmentation methods.
