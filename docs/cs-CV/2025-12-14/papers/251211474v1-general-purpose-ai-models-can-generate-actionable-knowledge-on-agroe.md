**关键词**: `农业生态作物保护` `大型语言模型` `知识生成` `幻觉检测` `决策支持` `科学验证`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：AI在农业食品科学中生成科学知识的应用未充分探索，需验证其准确性与实用性。
2. 方法要点：比较基于网络与非网络的LLMs（DeepSeek与ChatGPT）在九种全球性病虫害上的知识生成能力。
3. 实验或效果：DeepSeek在文献覆盖、解决方案数量和一致性上优于ChatGPT，但两者均存在幻觉和遗漏问题。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers potential for democratizing scientific knowledge and converting this to clear, actionable information, yet its application in agri-food science remains unexplored. Here, we verify the scientific knowledge on agroecological crop protection that is generated by either web-grounded or non-grounded large language models (LLMs), i.e., DeepSeek versus the free-tier version of ChatGPT. For nine globally limiting pests, weeds, and plant diseases, we assessed the factual accuracy, data consistency, and breadth of knowledge or data completeness of each LLM. Overall, DeepSeek consistently screened a 4.8-49.7-fold larger literature corpus and reported 1.6-2.4-fold more biological control agents or management solutions than ChatGPT. As a result, DeepSeek reported 21.6% higher efficacy estimates, exhibited greater laboratory-to-field data consistency, and showed more realistic effects of pest identity and management tactics. However, both models hallucinated, i.e., fabricated fictitious agents or references, reported on implausible ecological interactions or outcomes, confused old and new scientific nomenclatures, and omitted data on key agents or solutions. Despite these shortcomings, both LLMs correctly reported low-resolution efficacy trends. Overall, when paired with rigorous human oversight, LLMs may pose a powerful tool to support farm-level decision-making and unleash scientific creativity.
