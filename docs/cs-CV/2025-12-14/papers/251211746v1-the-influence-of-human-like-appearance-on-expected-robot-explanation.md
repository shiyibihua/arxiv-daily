## 💡 一句话要点

**研究机器人外观对人类化解释期望的影响，发现外观越像人，解释越具人类化特征。**

**关键词**: `机器人外观` `人类化解释` `人机交互` `期望解释` `视觉刺激`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：机器人外观如何影响用户对其解释的期望，特别是人类化程度。
2. 方法要点：设计组间实验，使用三种不同人类化外观的机器人视觉刺激，收集用户期望的解释。
3. 实验或效果：发现解释普遍人类化，且人类化外观与人类化解释呈正相关，并观察到非人类化解释的细微趋势。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> A robot's appearance is a known factor influencing user's mental model and human-robot interaction, that has not been studied in the context of its influence in expected robot explanations. In this study, we investigate whether and to what extent the human-like appearance of robots elicits anthropomorphism, which is conceptualised as an attribution of mental capacities, and how the level of anthropomorphism is revealed in explanations that people expect to receive. We designed a between-subject study comprising conditions with visual stimuli of three domestic service robots with varying human-like appearance, and we prompted respondents to provide explanations they would expect to receive from the robot for the same robot actions. We found that most explanations were anthropomorphic across all conditions. However, there is a positive correlation between the anthropomorphic explanations and human-like appearance. We also report on more nuanced trends observed in non-anthropomorphic explanations and trends in robot descriptions.
