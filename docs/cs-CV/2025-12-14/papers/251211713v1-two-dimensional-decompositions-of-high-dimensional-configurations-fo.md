## 📄 摘要（原文）

> For multi-vehicle complex traffic scenarios in shared spaces such as intelligent intersections, safe coordination and trajectory planning is challenging due to computational complexity. To meet this challenge, we introduce a computationally efficient method for generating collision-free trajectories along predefined vehicle paths. We reformulate a constrained minimum-time trajectory planning problem as a problem in a high-dimensional configuration space, where conflict zones are modeled by high-dimensional polyhedra constructed from two-dimensional rectangles. Still, in such a formulation, as the number of vehicles involved increases, the computational complexity increases significantly. To address this, we propose two algorithms for near-optimal local optimization that significantly reduce the computational complexity by decomposing the high-dimensional problem into a sequence of 2D graph search problems. The resulting trajectories are then incorporated into a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) framework to ensure safe and smooth vehicle motion. We furthermore show in numerical evaluation that this approach significantly outperforms existing MILP-based time-scheduling; both in terms of objective-value and computational time.
