## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing causes global economic losses of \$10-25 billion annually and undermines marine sustainability and governance. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides reliable maritime surveillance under all weather and lighting conditions, but classifying small maritime objects in SAR imagery remains challenging. We investigate quantum machine learning for this task, focusing on Quantum Kernel Methods (QKMs) applied to real and complex SAR chips extracted from the SARFish dataset. We tackle two binary classification problems, the first for distinguishing vessels from non-vessels, and the second for distinguishing fishing vessels from other types of vessels. We compare QKMs applied to real and complex SAR chips against classical Laplacian, RBF, and linear kernels applied to real SAR chips. Using noiseless numerical simulations of the quantum kernels, we find that QKMs are capable of obtaining equal or better performance than the classical kernel on these tasks in the best case, but do not demonstrate a clear advantage for the complex SAR data. This work presents the first application of QKMs to maritime classification in SAR imagery and offers insight into the potential and current limitations of quantum-enhanced learning for maritime surveillance.
