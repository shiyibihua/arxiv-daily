## 💡 一句话要点

**提出GrOCE框架以解决文本到图像扩散模型中的概念擦除问题**

**关键词**: `概念擦除` `文本到图像扩散模型` `图推理` `训练无关方法` `语义图构建`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 现有概念擦除方法依赖微调或粗语义分离，易损害无关概念且适应性差
2. GrOCE基于动态语义图进行训练无关的精确推理，实现细粒度概念隔离
3. 实验在CS和FID指标上达到SOTA，无需重训练即可高效稳定擦除概念

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Concept erasure aims to remove harmful, inappropriate, or copyrighted content from text-to-image diffusion models while preserving non-target semantics. However, existing methods either rely on costly fine-tuning or apply coarse semantic separation, often degrading unrelated concepts and lacking adaptability to evolving concept sets. To alleviate this issue, we propose Graph-Guided Online Concept Erasure (GrOCE), a training-free framework that performs precise and adaptive concept removal through graph-based semantic reasoning. GrOCE models concepts and their interrelations as a dynamic semantic graph, enabling principled reasoning over dependencies and fine-grained isolation of undesired content. It comprises three components: (1) Dynamic Topological Graph Construction for incremental graph building, (2) Adaptive Cluster Identification for multi-hop traversal with similarity-decay scoring, and (3) Selective Edge Severing for targeted edge removal while preserving global semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GrOCE achieves state-of-the-art performance on Concept Similarity (CS) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) metrics, offering efficient, accurate, and stable concept erasure without retraining.
