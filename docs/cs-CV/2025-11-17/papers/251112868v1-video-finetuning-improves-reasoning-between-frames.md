## 💡 一句话要点

**提出视觉思维链以提升多模态大模型在视频中的帧间推理能力**

**关键词**: `多模态大语言模型` `视频微调` `视觉思维链` `帧间推理` `长视频问答` `视觉推理`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：多模态大模型从图像扩展到视频时，常简单拼接帧令牌，缺乏帧间推理。
2. 方法要点：引入视觉思维链，生成连续帧间的过渡事件描述，用于系统比较模型。
3. 实验或效果：视频微调模型在长视频问答中表现更优，并能迁移到静态视觉推理任务。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Multimodal large language models (LLMs) have made rapid progress in visual understanding, yet their extension from images to videos often reduces to a naive concatenation of frame tokens. In this work, we investigate what video finetuning brings to multimodal LLMs. We propose Visual Chain-of-Thought (vCoT), an explicit reasoning process that generates transitional event descriptions between consecutive frames. Using vCoT, we systematically compare image-only LVLMs with their video-finetuned counterparts, both with and without access to these transitional cues. Our experiments show that vCoT significantly improves the performance of image-only models on long-form video question answering, while yielding only marginal gains for video-finetuned models. This suggests that the latter already capture frame-to-frame transitions implicitly. Moreover, we find that video models transfer this temporal reasoning ability to purely static settings, outperforming image models' baselines on relational visual reasoning tasks.
