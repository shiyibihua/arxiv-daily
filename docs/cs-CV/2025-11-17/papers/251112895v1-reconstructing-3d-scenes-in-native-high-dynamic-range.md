## 📄 摘要（原文）

> High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging is essential for professional digital media creation, e.g., filmmaking, virtual production, and photorealistic rendering. However, 3D scene reconstruction has primarily focused on Low Dynamic Range (LDR) data, limiting its applicability to professional workflows. Existing approaches that reconstruct HDR scenes from LDR observations rely on multi-exposure fusion or inverse tone-mapping, which increase capture complexity and depend on synthetic supervision. With the recent emergence of cameras that directly capture native HDR data in a single exposure, we present the first method for 3D scene reconstruction that directly models native HDR observations. We propose {\bf Native High dynamic range 3D Gaussian Splatting (NH-3DGS)}, which preserves the full dynamic range throughout the reconstruction pipeline. Our key technical contribution is a novel luminance-chromaticity decomposition of the color representation that enables direct optimization from native HDR camera data. We demonstrate on both synthetic and real multi-view HDR datasets that NH-3DGS significantly outperforms existing methods in reconstruction quality and dynamic range preservation, enabling professional-grade 3D reconstruction directly from native HDR captures. Code and datasets will be made available.
