## 💡 一句话要点

**提出SpectraMorph框架，通过结构化潜空间和自监督学习解决高光谱图像超分辨率问题**

**关键词**: `高光谱超分辨率` `自监督学习` `结构化潜空间` `图像融合` `解混方法`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 高光谱传感器空间分辨率低，导致边界模糊和混合像素问题
2. 使用物理引导的自监督方法，强制解混瓶颈，从多光谱图像预测丰度图
3. 实验显示在合成和真实数据集上优于无监督基线，对单波段MSI保持鲁棒

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
> spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
> Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
> cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
> super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
> (HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
> rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
> MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
> self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
> direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
> signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
> perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
> by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
> MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
> intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
> single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
> datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
> unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
> supervised baselines.
