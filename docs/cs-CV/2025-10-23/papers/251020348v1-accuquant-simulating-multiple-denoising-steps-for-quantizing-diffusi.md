## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
> dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
> that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
> steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
> AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
> diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
> That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
> explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
> denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
> training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
> independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
> technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
> memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
> where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
> efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
> benchmarks.
