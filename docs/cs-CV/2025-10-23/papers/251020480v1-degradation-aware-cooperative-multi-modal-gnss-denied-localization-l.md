## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Accurate long-term localization using onboard sensors is crucial for robots
> operating in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments.
> While complementary sensors mitigate individual degradations, carrying all the
> available sensor types on a single robot significantly increases the size,
> weight, and power demands. Distributing sensors across multiple robots enhances
> the deployability but introduces challenges in fusing asynchronous, multi-modal
> data from independently moving platforms. We propose a novel adaptive
> multi-modal multi-robot cooperative localization approach using a factor-graph
> formulation to fuse asynchronous Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), LiDAR-Inertial
> Odometry (LIO), and 3D inter-robot detections from distinct robots in a
> loosely-coupled fashion. The approach adapts to changing conditions, leveraging
> reliable data to assist robots affected by sensory degradations. A novel
> interpolation-based factor enables fusion of the unsynchronized measurements.
> LIO degradations are evaluated based on the approximate scan-matching Hessian.
> A novel approach of weighting odometry data proportionally to the Wasserstein
> distance between the consecutive VIO outputs is proposed. A theoretical
> analysis is provided, investigating the cooperative localization problem under
> various conditions, mainly in the presence of sensory degradations. The
> proposed method has been extensively evaluated on real-world data gathered with
> heterogeneous teams of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) and Unmanned Aerial
> Vehicles (UAVs), showing that the approach provides significant improvements in
> localization accuracy in the presence of various sensory degradations.
