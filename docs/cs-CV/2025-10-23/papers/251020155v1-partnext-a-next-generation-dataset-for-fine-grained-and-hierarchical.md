## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
> to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
> PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
> untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
> usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
> gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
> fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
> PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
> state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
> fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
> a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
> part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
> gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
> By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
> evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
> understanding.
