## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Despite well-reported instances of robots being used in disaster response,
> there is scant published data on the internal composition of the void spaces
> within structural collapse incidents. Data collected during these incidents is
> mired in legal constraints, as ownership is often tied to the responding
> agencies, with little hope of public release for research. While engineered
> rubble piles are used for training, these sites are also reluctant to release
> information about their proprietary training grounds. To overcome this access
> challenge, we present RubbleSim -- an open-source, reconfigurable simulator for
> photorealistic void space exploration. The design of the simulation assets is
> directly informed by visits to numerous training rubble sites at differing
> levels of complexity. The simulator is implemented in Unity with
> multi-operating system support. The simulation uses a physics-based approach to
> build stochastic rubble piles, allowing for rapid iteration between simulation
> worlds while retaining absolute knowledge of the ground truth. Using RubbleSim,
> we apply a state-of-the-art structure-from-motion algorithm to illustrate how
> perception performance degrades under challenging visual conditions inside the
> emulated void spaces. Pre-built binaries and source code to implement are
> available online: https://github.com/mit-ll/rubble_pile_simulator.
