## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
> to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
> imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
> artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
> arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
> proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
> (AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
> these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
> and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
> the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
> extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
> progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
> research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
> studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
> dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
> basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
> acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
> techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
> different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
> strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
> commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
> discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
> future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
> reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and
> detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.
