## 💡 一句话要点

**提出对比超声视频表示学习框架以客观检测胎儿运动**

**关键词**: `胎儿运动检测` `自监督学习` `对比学习` `超声视频分析` `长视频处理`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 胎儿运动检测主观性强，传统方法如母体感知和CTG准确率有限
2. 采用自监督对比学习，结合空间和时间对比损失学习运动表示
3. 在92名受试者数据集上，敏感度78.01%，AUROC 81.60%

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
> health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
> such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
> maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
> limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
> Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
> learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
> recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
> spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
> representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
> ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
> self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
> ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
> on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
> CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
> potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
> potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
> paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.
