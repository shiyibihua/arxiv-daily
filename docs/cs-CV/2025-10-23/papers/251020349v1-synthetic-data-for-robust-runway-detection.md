## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
> possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
> collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
> costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
> critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
> including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
> an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
> conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
> distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
> runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
> developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
> based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
> images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
> synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
> accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
> conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
> data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.
