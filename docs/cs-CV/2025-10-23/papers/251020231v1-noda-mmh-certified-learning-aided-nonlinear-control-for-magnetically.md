## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This study experimentally validates the principle of large-scale satellite
> swarm control through learning-aided magnetic field interactions generated by
> satellite-mounted magnetorquers. This actuation presents a promising solution
> for the long-term formation maintenance of multiple satellites and has
> primarily been demonstrated in ground-based testbeds for two-satellite position
> control. However, as the number of satellites increases beyond three,
> fundamental challenges coupled with the high nonlinearity arise: 1)
> nonholonomic constraints, 2) underactuation, 3) scalability, and 4)
> computational cost. Previous studies have shown that time-integrated current
> control theoretically solves these problems, where the average actuator outputs
> align with the desired command, and a learning-based technique further enhances
> their performance. Through multiple experiments, we validate critical aspects
> of learning-aided time-integrated current control: (1) enhanced controllability
> of the averaged system dynamics, with a theoretically guaranteed error bound,
> and (2) decentralized current management. We design two-axis coils and a
> ground-based experimental setup utilizing an air-bearing platform, enabling a
> mathematical replication of orbital dynamics. Based on the effectiveness of the
> learned interaction model, we introduce NODA-MMH (Neural power-Optimal Dipole
> Allocation for certified learned Model-based Magnetically swarm control
> Harness) for model-based power-optimal swarm control. This study complements
> our tutorial paper on magnetically actuated swarms for the long-term formation
> maintenance problem.
