## 💡 一句话要点

**分析视频基础模型在霹雳舞视频分类中的适用性，比较编码器与解码器模型性能。**

**关键词**: `视频分类` `霹雳舞` `视频基础模型` `编码器模型` `解码器模型` `性能比较`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有视觉语言模型多针对流行运动，霹雳舞等小众舞蹈运动分类研究不足。
2. 方法要点：评估现代视频基础模型，包括编码器和解码器，并指导模型选择。
3. 实验或效果：视频编码器模型在预测任务中优于最先进的视频语言模型。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Large Vision Language models have seen huge application in several sports
> use-cases recently. Most of these works have been targeted towards a limited
> subset of popular sports like soccer, cricket, basketball etc; focusing on
> generative tasks like visual question answering, highlight generation. This
> work analyzes the applicability of the modern video foundation models (both
> encoder and decoder) for a very niche but hugely popular dance sports -
> breakdance. Our results show that Video Encoder models continue to outperform
> state-of-the-art Video Language Models for prediction tasks. We provide
> insights on how to choose the encoder model and provide a thorough analysis
> into the workings of a finetuned decoder model for breakdance video
> classification.
