## 📄 摘要（原文）

> A major field of industrial robot applications deals with repetitive tasks
> that alternate between operating points. For these so-called pick-and-place
> operations, parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM) are frequently employed.
> These tasks tend to automatically run for a long period of time and therefore
> minimizing energy consumption is always of interest. Recent research addresses
> this topic by the use of elastic elements and particularly series elastic
> actuators (SEA). This paper explores the possibilities of minimizing energy
> consumption of SEA actuated PKM performing pick-and-place tasks. The basic idea
> is to excite eigenmotions that result from the actuator springs and exploit
> their oscillating characteristics. To this end, a prescribed cyclic
> pick-and-place operation is analyzed and a dynamic model of SEA driven PKM is
> derived. Subsequently, an energy minimizing optimal control problem is
> formulated where operating trajectories as well as SEA stiffnesses are
> optimized simultaneously. Here, optimizing the actuator stiffness does not
> account for variable stiffness actuators. It serves as a tool for the design
> and dimensioning process. The hypothesis on energy reduction is tested on two
> (parallel) robot applications where redundant actuation is also addressed. The
> results confirm the validity of this approach.
