## 📄 摘要（原文）

> A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
> has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
> renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
> shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
> computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
> specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
> array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
> propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
> single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
> implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
> method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
> the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
> neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
> neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
> image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
> finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
> After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
> image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
> rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
> generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
> rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
> or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
> state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.
