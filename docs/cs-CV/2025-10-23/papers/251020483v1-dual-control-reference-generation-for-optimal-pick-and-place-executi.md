## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This work addresses the problem of robot manipulation tasks under unknown
> dynamics, such as pick-and-place tasks under payload uncertainty, where active
> exploration and(/for) online parameter adaptation during task execution are
> essential to enable accurate model-based control. The problem is framed as dual
> control seeking a closed-loop optimal control problem that accounts for
> parameter uncertainty. We simplify the dual control problem by pre-defining the
> structure of the feedback policy to include an explicit adaptation mechanism.
> Then we propose two methods for reference trajectory generation. The first
> directly embeds parameter uncertainty in robust optimal control methods that
> minimize the expected task cost. The second method considers minimizing the
> so-called optimality loss, which measures the sensitivity of parameter-relevant
> information with respect to task performance. We observe that both approaches
> reason over the Fisher information as a natural side effect of their
> formulations, simultaneously pursuing optimal task execution. We demonstrate
> the effectiveness of our approaches for a pick-and-place manipulation task. We
> show that designing the reference trajectories whilst taking into account the
> control enables faster and more accurate task performance and system
> identification while ensuring stable and efficient control.
