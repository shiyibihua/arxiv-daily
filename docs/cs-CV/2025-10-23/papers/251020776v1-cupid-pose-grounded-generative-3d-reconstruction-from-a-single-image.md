**关键词**: `单图像3D重建` `姿态估计` `生成模型` `流匹配` `体素生成`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：从单张2D图像准确推断相机姿态、3D形状和纹理。
2. 方法要点：采用两阶段流匹配，联合生成体素和像素-体素对应关系。
3. 实验效果：PSNR提升超3 dB，Chamfer距离降低超10%，姿态精度媲美单目估计器。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
> Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
> object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
> sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
> generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
> shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
> input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
> Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
> produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
> and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
> enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
> demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
> dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
> monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
> over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results
> generated by Cupid, please visit cupid3d.github.io.
