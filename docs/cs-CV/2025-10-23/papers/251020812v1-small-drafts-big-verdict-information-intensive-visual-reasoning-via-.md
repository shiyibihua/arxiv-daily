## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
> multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
> information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
> fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
> localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
> dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
> framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
> draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
> draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
> candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
> produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
> correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
> consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
> reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
> challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
> benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
> By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
> paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
> proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at
