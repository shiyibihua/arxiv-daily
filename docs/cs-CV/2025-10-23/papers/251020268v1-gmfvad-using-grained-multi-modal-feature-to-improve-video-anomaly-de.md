## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
> frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
> spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
> abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
> multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
> anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
> video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
> redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
> propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
> refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
> we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
> Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
> snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
> captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
> features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
> achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
> experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
> reduction of redundant information.
