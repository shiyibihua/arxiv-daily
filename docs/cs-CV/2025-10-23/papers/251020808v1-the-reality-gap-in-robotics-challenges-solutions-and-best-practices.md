## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Machine learning has facilitated significant advancements across various
> robotics domains, including navigation, locomotion, and manipulation. Many such
> achievements have been driven by the extensive use of simulation as a critical
> tool for training and testing robotic systems prior to their deployment in
> real-world environments. However, simulations consist of abstractions and
> approximations that inevitably introduce discrepancies between simulated and
> real environments, known as the reality gap. These discrepancies significantly
> hinder the successful transfer of systems from simulation to the real world.
> Closing this gap remains one of the most pressing challenges in robotics.
> Recent advances in sim-to-real transfer have demonstrated promising results
> across various platforms, including locomotion, navigation, and manipulation.
> By leveraging techniques such as domain randomization, real-to-sim transfer,
> state and action abstractions, and sim-real co-training, many works have
> overcome the reality gap. However, challenges persist, and a deeper
> understanding of the reality gap's root causes and solutions is necessary. In
> this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the sim-to-real landscape,
> highlighting the causes, solutions, and evaluation metrics for the reality gap
> and sim-to-real transfer.
