## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Accurate waste classification is vital for achieving sustainable waste
> management and reducing the environmental footprint of urbanization.
> Misclassification of recyclable materials contributes to landfill accumulation,
> inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these
> issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning
> framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable
> self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable
> intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model
> employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial
> representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map
> (Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking
> neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps,
> improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset,
> HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several
> state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational
> profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations,
> the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and
> automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces
> contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and
> operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global
> sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable
> Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities,
> circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.
