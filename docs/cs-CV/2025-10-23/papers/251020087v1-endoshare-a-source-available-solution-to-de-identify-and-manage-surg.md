## 💡 一句话要点

**提出Endoshare以解决内窥镜视频去标识化和标准化管理问题**

**关键词**: `手术视频管理` `视频去标识化` `隐私保护` `跨平台应用` `用户中心设计`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：手术视频格式异构和隐私问题限制视频评估与共享
2. 方法要点：开发跨平台应用，采用隐私设计架构，合并、标准化和去标识化视频
3. 实验或效果：用户测试显示高可用性和易用性，处理时间受视频时长和硬件影响

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
> training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
> limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
> video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
> application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
> minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
> cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
> internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
> heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
> architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
> same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
> and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
> configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
> the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
> with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
> refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
> usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
> usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
> Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
> and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
> user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
> management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
> are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.
