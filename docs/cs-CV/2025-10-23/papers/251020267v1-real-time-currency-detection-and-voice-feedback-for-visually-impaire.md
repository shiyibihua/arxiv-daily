## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Technologies like smartphones have become an essential in our daily lives. It
> has made accessible to everyone including visually impaired individuals. With
> the use of smartphone cameras, image capturing and processing have become more
> convenient. With the use of smartphones and machine learning, the life of
> visually impaired can be made a little easier. Daily tasks such as handling
> money without relying on someone can be troublesome for them. For that purpose
> this paper presents a real-time currency detection system designed to assist
> visually impaired individuals. The proposed model is trained on a dataset
> containing 30 classes of notes and coins, representing 3 types of currency: US
> dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), and Bangladeshi taka (BDT). Our approach uses a
> YOLOv8 nano model with a custom detection head featuring deep convolutional
> layers and Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks to enhance feature extraction and
> detection accuracy. Our model has achieved a higher accuracy of 97.73%, recall
> of 95.23%, f1-score of 95.85% and a mean Average Precision at IoU=0.5
> (mAP50(B)) of 97.21\%. Using the voice feedback after the detection would help
> the visually impaired to identify the currency. This paper aims to create a
> practical and efficient currency detection system to empower visually impaired
> individuals independent in handling money.
