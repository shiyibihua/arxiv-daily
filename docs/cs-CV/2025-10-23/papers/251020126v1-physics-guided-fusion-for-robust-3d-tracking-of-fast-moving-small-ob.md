## 📄 摘要（原文）

> While computer vision has advanced considerably for general object detection
> and tracking, the specific problem of fast-moving tiny objects remains
> underexplored. This paper addresses the significant challenge of detecting and
> tracking rapidly moving small objects using an RGB-D camera. Our novel system
> combines deep learning-based detection with physics-based tracking to overcome
> the limitations of existing approaches. Our contributions include: (1) a
> comprehensive system design for object detection and tracking of fast-moving
> small objects in 3D space, (2) an innovative physics-based tracking algorithm
> that integrates kinematics motion equations to handle outliers and missed
> detections, and (3) an outlier detection and correction module that
> significantly improves tracking performance in challenging scenarios such as
> occlusions and rapid direction changes. We evaluated our proposed system on a
> custom racquetball dataset. Our evaluation shows our system surpassing kalman
> filter based trackers with up to 70\% less Average Displacement Error. Our
> system has significant applications for improving robot perception on
> autonomous platforms and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining
> physics-based models with deep learning approaches for real-time 3D detection
> and tracking of challenging small objects.
