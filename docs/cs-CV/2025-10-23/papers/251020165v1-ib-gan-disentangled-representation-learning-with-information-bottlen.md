## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
> learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
> Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
> architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
> critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
> constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
> The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
> that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
> result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
> and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
> dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
> to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
> the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
> better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA
> and 3D Chairs dataset.
