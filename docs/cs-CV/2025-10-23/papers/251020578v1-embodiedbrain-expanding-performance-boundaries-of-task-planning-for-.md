## 💡 一句话要点

**提出EmbodiedBrain模型以解决具身智能任务规划中的性能与延迟权衡问题**

**关键词**: `具身智能` `任务规划` `多模态大语言模型` `强化学习优化` `仿真环境` `开源框架`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 当前LLMs和MLLMs在具身任务中存在模型设计与代理需求不匹配、实时延迟与性能权衡、评估指标不真实等问题
2. 采用代理对齐数据结构和SFT与Step-GRPO训练方法，集成生成奖励模型提升长时任务成功率

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
> Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task
> planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current
> large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks
> suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design
> and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and
> performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address
> these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation
> model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an
> agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that
> integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group
> Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task
> success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we
> incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model
> (GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency.
> For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system
> encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks,
> highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging
> simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain
> achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new
> state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the
> next generation of generalist embodied agents, we open-source all of our data,
> model weight, and evaluating methods, which are available at
> https://zterobot.github.io/EmbodiedBrain.github.io.
