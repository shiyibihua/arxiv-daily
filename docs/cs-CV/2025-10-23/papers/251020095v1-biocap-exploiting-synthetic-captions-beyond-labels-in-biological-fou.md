## 💡 一句话要点

**提出BIOCAP模型，利用合成描述增强生物多模态基础模型性能**

**关键词**: `生物多模态基础模型` `合成描述生成` `物种分类` `文本-图像检索` `多模态大语言模型` `生物图像分析`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：生物图像缺乏大规模实例特异性描述，限制多模态监督应用
2. 方法要点：使用多模态大语言模型生成合成描述，结合维基百科视觉信息
3. 实验或效果：模型在物种分类和文本-图像检索中表现优异，验证描述价值

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
> supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
> can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
> species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
> during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
> emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
> correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
> instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
> utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
> many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
> captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
> Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
> domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
> instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
> (i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
> semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
> text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
> captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
> models.
