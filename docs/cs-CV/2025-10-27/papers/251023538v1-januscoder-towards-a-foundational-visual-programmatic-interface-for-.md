## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The scope of neural code intelligence is rapidly expanding beyond text-based
> source code to encompass the rich visual outputs that programs generate. This
> visual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content
> generation and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However,
> progress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data,
> a bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To
> address these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling
> perspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages
> reciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a
> large-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex
> interactive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we
> construct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This
> powers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish
> a visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions,
> visual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from
> existing approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks. Extensive
> experiments on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks demonstrate
> the superior performance of the JanusCoder series, with our 7B to 14B scale
> models approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models.
> Furthermore, extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing
> programmatic logic with its visual expression. Our code and checkpoints will
> are available at https://github.com/InternLM/JanusCoder.
