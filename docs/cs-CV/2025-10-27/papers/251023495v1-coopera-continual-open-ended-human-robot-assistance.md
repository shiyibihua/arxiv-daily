## 💡 一句话要点

**提出COOPERA框架以解决长期开放人机协作中个性化适应问题**

**关键词**: `人机协作` `持续学习` `个性化适应` `模拟人类` `意图推断` `开放任务`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：机器人缺乏长期学习和适应人类特质与习惯的能力
2. 方法要点：集成连续人类反馈，学习人类特质和情境意图以个性化协作
3. 实验或效果：验证模拟人类行为真实性，展示意图推断对长期协作的价值

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> To understand and collaborate with humans, robots must account for individual
> human traits, habits, and activities over time. However, most robotic
> assistants lack these abilities, as they primarily focus on predefined tasks in
> structured environments and lack a human model to learn from. This work
> introduces COOPERA, a novel framework for COntinual, OPen-Ended human-Robot
> Assistance, where simulated humans, driven by psychological traits and
> long-term intentions, interact with robots in complex environments. By
> integrating continuous human feedback, our framework, for the first time,
> enables the study of long-term, open-ended human-robot collaboration (HRC) in
> different collaborative tasks across various time-scales. Within COOPERA, we
> introduce a benchmark and an approach to personalize the robot's collaborative
> actions by learning human traits and context-dependent intents. Experiments
> validate the extent to which our simulated humans reflect realistic human
> behaviors and demonstrate the value of inferring and personalizing to human
> intents for open-ended and long-term HRC. Project Page:
