## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Foundation models have transformed natural language processing and computer
> vision, and their impact is now reshaping remote sensing image analysis. With
> powerful generalization and transfer learning capabilities, they align
> naturally with the multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-temporal
> characteristics of remote sensing data. To address unique challenges in the
> field, multimodal geospatial foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a
> dedicated research frontier. This survey delivers a comprehensive review of
> multimodal GFMs from a modality-driven perspective, covering five core visual
> and vision-language modalities. We examine how differences in imaging physics
> and data representation shape interaction design, and we analyze key techniques
> for alignment, integration, and knowledge transfer to tackle modality
> heterogeneity, distribution shifts, and semantic gaps. Advances in training
> paradigms, architectures, and task-specific adaptation strategies are
> systematically assessed alongside a wealth of emerging benchmarks.
> Representative multimodal visual and vision-language GFMs are evaluated across
> ten downstream tasks, with insights into their architectures, performance, and
> application scenarios. Real-world case studies, spanning land cover mapping,
> agricultural monitoring, disaster response, climate studies, and geospatial
> intelligence, demonstrate the practical potential of GFMs. Finally, we outline
> pressing challenges in domain generalization, interpretability, efficiency, and
> privacy, and chart promising avenues for future research.
