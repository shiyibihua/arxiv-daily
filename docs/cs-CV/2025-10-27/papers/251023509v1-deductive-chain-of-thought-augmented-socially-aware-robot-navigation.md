## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Social robot navigation increasingly relies on large language models for
> reasoning, path planning, and enabling movement in dynamic human spaces.
> However, relying solely on LLMs for planning often leads to unpredictable and
> unsafe behaviors, especially in dynamic human spaces, due to limited physical
> grounding and weak logical consistency. In this work, we introduce NaviWM, a
> socially-aware robot Navigation World Model that augments LLM reasoning with a
> structured world model and a logic-driven chain-of-thought process. NaviWM
> consists of two main components: (1) a spatial-temporal world model that
> captures the positions, velocities, and activities of agents in the
> environment, and (2) a deductive reasoning module that guides LLMs through a
> multi-step, logic-based inference process. This integration enables the robot
> to generate navigation decisions that are both socially compliant and
> physically safe, under well-defined constraints such as personal space,
> collision avoidance, and timing. Unlike previous methods based on prompting or
> fine-tuning, NaviWM encodes social norms as first-order logic, enabling
> interpretable and verifiable reasoning. Experiments show that NaviWM improves
> success rates and reduces social violations, particularly in crowded
> environments. These results demonstrate the benefit of combining formal
> reasoning with LLMs for robust social navigation. Additional experimental
> details and demo videos for this work can be found at:
