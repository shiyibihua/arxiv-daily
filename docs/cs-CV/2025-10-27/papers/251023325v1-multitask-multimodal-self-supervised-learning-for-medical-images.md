## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This thesis works to address a pivotal challenge in medical image analysis:
> the reliance on extensive labeled datasets, which are often limited due to the
> need for expert annotation and constrained by privacy and legal issues. By
> focusing on the development of self-supervised learning techniques and domain
> adaptation methods, this research aims to circumvent these limitations,
> presenting a novel approach to enhance the utility and efficacy of deep
> learning in medical imaging.
>   Central to this thesis is the development of the Medformer, an innovative
> neural network architecture designed for multitask learning and deep domain
> adaptation. This model is adept at pre-training on diverse medical image
> datasets, handling varying sizes and modalities, and is equipped with a dynamic
> input-output adaptation mechanism. This enables efficient processing and
> integration of a wide range of medical image types, from 2D X-rays to complex
> 3D MRIs, thus mitigating the dependency on large labeled datasets.
>   Further, the thesis explores the current state of self-supervised learning in
> medical imaging. It introduces novel pretext tasks that are capable of
> extracting meaningful information from unlabeled data, significantly advancing
> the model's interpretative abilities. This approach is validated through
> rigorous experimentation, including the use of the MedMNIST dataset,
> demonstrating the model's proficiency in learning generalized features
> applicable to various downstream tasks.
>   In summary, this thesis contributes to the advancement of medical image
> analysis by offering a scalable, adaptable framework that reduces reliance on
> labeled data. It paves the way for more accurate, efficient diagnostic tools in
> healthcare, signifying a major step forward in the application of deep learning
> in medical imaging.
