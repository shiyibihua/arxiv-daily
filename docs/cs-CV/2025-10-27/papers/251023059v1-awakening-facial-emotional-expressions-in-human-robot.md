**关键词**: `人形社交机器人` `面部表情生成` `KAN网络` `注意力机制` `端到端学习` `仿生机器人脸`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：人形社交机器人依赖预编程表情，成本高且缺乏自主性。
2. 方法要点：设计仿生机器人脸，结合KAN和注意力机制实现端到端学习。
3. 实验或效果：评估显示方法能准确、多样地模仿不同测试对象的面部表情。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The facial expression generation capability of humanoid social robots is
> critical for achieving natural and human-like interactions, playing a vital
> role in enhancing the fluidity of human-robot interactions and the accuracy of
> emotional expression. Currently, facial expression generation in humanoid
> social robots still relies on pre-programmed behavioral patterns, which are
> manually coded at high human and time costs. To enable humanoid robots to
> autonomously acquire generalized expressive capabilities, they need to develop
> the ability to learn human-like expressions through self-training. To address
> this challenge, we have designed a highly biomimetic robotic face with
> physical-electronic animated facial units and developed an end-to-end learning
> framework based on KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) and attention mechanisms.
> Unlike previous humanoid social robots, we have also meticulously designed an
> automated data collection system based on expert strategies of facial motion
> primitives to construct the dataset. Notably, to the best of our knowledge,
> this is the first open-source facial dataset for humanoid social robots.
> Comprehensive evaluations indicate that our approach achieves accurate and
> diverse facial mimicry across different test subjects.
