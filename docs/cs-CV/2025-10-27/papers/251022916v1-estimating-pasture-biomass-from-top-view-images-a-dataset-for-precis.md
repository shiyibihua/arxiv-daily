## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Accurate estimation of pasture biomass is important for decision-making in
> livestock production systems. Estimates of pasture biomass can be used to
> manage stocking rates to maximise pasture utilisation, while minimising the
> risk of overgrazing and promoting overall system health. We present a
> comprehensive dataset of 1,162 annotated top-view images of pastures collected
> across 19 locations in Australia. The images were taken across multiple seasons
> and include a range of temperate pasture species. Each image captures a 70cm *
> 30cm quadrat and is paired with on-ground measurements including biomass sorted
> by component (green, dead, and legume fraction), vegetation height, and
> Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Active Optical Sensors
> (AOS). The multidimensional nature of the data, which combines visual,
> spectral, and structural information, opens up new possibilities for advancing
> the use of precision grazing management. The dataset is released and hosted in
> a Kaggle competition that challenges the international Machine Learning
> community with the task of pasture biomass estimation. The dataset is available
> on the official Kaggle webpage:
