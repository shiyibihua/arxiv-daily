## 💡 一句话要点

**提出TIRE方法以解决主题驱动3D/4D生成中的身份保持问题**

**关键词**: `主题驱动生成` `3D生成` `4D生成` `纹理修复` `视频跟踪` `多视图一致性`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 现有3D/4D生成方法难以在不同视角下保持主题的语义身份
2. 通过跟踪、修复和重投影，渐进填充纹理以提升身份一致性
3. 实验显示在身份保持方面优于现有先进方法

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Current 3D/4D generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism,
> efficiency, and aesthetics. However, they often fail to preserve the semantic
> identity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation
> methods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as
> Personalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content
> that align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D
> generation is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE
> (Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation.
> It takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as
> input and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified.
> Then, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling
> the identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view
> observations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency. Extensive
> experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity
> preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our
> project website is available at
