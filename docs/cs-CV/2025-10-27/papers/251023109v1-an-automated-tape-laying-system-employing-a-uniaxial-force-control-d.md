## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper deals with the design of a cost effective automated tape laying
> system (ATL system) with integrated uniaxial force control to ensure the
> necessary compaction forces as well as with an accurate temperature control to
> guarantee the used tape being melted appropriate. It is crucial to control the
> substrate and the oncoming tape onto a specific temperature level to ensure an
> optimal consolidation between the different layers of the product. Therefore,
> it takes several process steps from the spooled tape on the coil until it is
> finally tacked onto the desired mold. The different modules are divided into
> the tape storage spool, a tape-guiding roller, a tape processing unit, a
> heating zone and the consolidation unit. Moreover, a special robot control
> concept for testing the ATL system is presented. In contrast to many other
> systems, with this approach, the tape laying device is spatially fixed and the
> shape is moved accordingly by the robot, which allows for handling of rather
> compact and complex shapes. The functionality of the subsystems and the taping
> process itself was finally approved in experimental results using a carbon
> fiber reinforced HDPE tape.
