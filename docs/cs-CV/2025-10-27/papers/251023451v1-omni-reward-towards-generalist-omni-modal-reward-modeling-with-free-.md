## 💡 一句话要点

**提出Omni-Reward以解决多模态奖励模型中的模态不平衡和偏好僵化问题**

**关键词**: `多模态奖励建模` `自由形式偏好` `奖励模型基准` `多模态数据集` `生成式奖励模型`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有奖励模型模态不平衡，偏好僵化，难以处理个性化偏好
2. 方法要点：构建多模态基准、数据集和模型，支持自由形式偏好
3. 实验或效果：在Omni-RewardBench等基准上表现优异，覆盖五种模态

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning AI behaviors with human
> preferences, yet they face two fundamental challenges: (1) Modality Imbalance,
> where most RMs are mainly focused on text and image modalities, offering
> limited support for video, audio, and other modalities; and (2) Preference
> Rigidity, where training on fixed binary preference pairs fails to capture the
> complexity and diversity of personalized preferences. To address the above
> challenges, we propose Omni-Reward, a step toward generalist omni-modal reward
> modeling with support for free-form preferences, consisting of: (1) Evaluation:
> We introduce Omni-RewardBench, the first omni-modal RM benchmark with free-form
> preferences, covering nine tasks across five modalities including text, image,
> video, audio, and 3D; (2) Data: We construct Omni-RewardData, a multimodal
> preference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K
> instruction-tuning pairs for training generalist omni-modal RMs; (3) Model: We
> propose Omni-RewardModel, which includes both discriminative and generative
> RMs, and achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench as well as other
> widely used reward modeling benchmarks.
