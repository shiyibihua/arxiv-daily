## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Audio-driven human animation models often suffer from identity drift during
> temporal autoregressive generation, where characters gradually lose their
> identity over time. One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate
> temporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional
> keyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address
> this, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future
> timesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This
> transforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model
> continuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio
> cues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also
> enables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead
> target, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the
> temporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity
> and consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while
> smaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human
> animation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization,
> identity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal
> conditioning across several different architectures. Video results are
> available at the following link: https://lookahead-anchoring.github.io.
