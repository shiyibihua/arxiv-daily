## 💡 一句话要点

**探索机器人价值意识对人类决策的影响，通过标签任务实验揭示其潜在风险与益处。**

**关键词**: `社会机器人` `价值意识` `决策影响` `人机交互` `实验研究` `伦理风险`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：机器人价值意识是否增强其对人类决策的影响力。
2. 方法要点：使用价值意识和非价值意识机器人进行图像标签任务交互。
3. 实验效果：参与者注视价值意识机器人更多，感知其更忠诚，且机器人分歧引发犹豫。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This study investigates whether the opinions of robotic agents are more
> likely to influence human decision-making when the robots are perceived as
> value-aware (i.e., when they display an understanding of human principles). We
> designed an experiment in which participants interacted with two Furhat robots
> - one programmed to be Value-Aware and the other Non-Value-Aware - during a
> labeling task for images representing human values. Results indicate that
> participants distinguished the Value-Aware robot from the Non-Value-Aware one.
> Although their explicit choices did not indicate a clear preference for one
> robot over the other, participants directed their gaze more toward the
> Value-Aware robot. Additionally, the Value-Aware robot was perceived as more
> loyal, suggesting that value awareness in a social robot may enhance its
> perceived commitment to the group. Finally, when both robots disagreed with the
> participant, conformity occurred in about one out of four trials, and
> participants took longer to confirm their responses, suggesting that two robots
> expressing dissent may introduce hesitation in decision-making. On one hand,
> this highlights the potential risk that robots, if misused, could manipulate
> users for unethical purposes. On the other hand, it reinforces the idea that
> social robots might encourage reflection in ambiguous situations and help users
> avoid scams.
