## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Urban micromobility applications, such as delivery robots, demand reliable
> navigation across large-scale urban environments while following long-horizon
> route instructions. This task is particularly challenging due to the dynamic
> and unstructured nature of real-world city areas, yet most existing navigation
> methods remain tailored to short-scale and controllable scenarios. Effective
> urban micromobility requires two complementary levels of navigation skills:
> low-level capabilities such as point-goal reaching and obstacle avoidance, and
> high-level capabilities, such as route-visual alignment. To this end, we
> propose UrbanVLA, a route-conditioned Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework
> designed for scalable urban navigation. Our method explicitly aligns noisy
> route waypoints with visual observations during execution, and subsequently
> plans trajectories to drive the robot. To enable UrbanVLA to master both levels
> of navigation, we employ a two-stage training pipeline. The process begins with
> Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using simulated environments and trajectories
> parsed from web videos. This is followed by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on
> a mixture of simulation and real-world data, which enhances the model's safety
> and adaptability in real-world settings. Experiments demonstrate that UrbanVLA
> surpasses strong baselines by more than 55% in the SocialNav task on MetaUrban.
> Furthermore, UrbanVLA achieves reliable real-world navigation, showcasing both
> scalability to large-scale urban environments and robustness against real-world
> uncertainties.
