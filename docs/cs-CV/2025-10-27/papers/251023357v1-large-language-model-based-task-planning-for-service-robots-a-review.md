## 📄 摘要（原文）

> With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and robotics,
> service robots are increasingly becoming an integral part of daily life,
> offering a wide range of services in complex environments. To deliver these
> services intelligently and efficiently, robust and accurate task planning
> capabilities are essential. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the
> integration of LLMs into service robotics, with a particular focus on their
> role in enhancing robotic task planning. First, the development and
> foundational techniques of LLMs, including pre-training, fine-tuning,
> retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and prompt engineering, are reviewed. We
> then explore the application of LLMs as the cognitive core-`brain'-of service
> robots, discussing how LLMs contribute to improved autonomy and
> decision-making. Furthermore, recent advancements in LLM-driven task planning
> across various input modalities are analyzed, including text, visual, audio,
> and multimodal inputs. Finally, we summarize key challenges and limitations in
> current research and propose future directions to advance the task planning
> capabilities of service robots in complex, unstructured domestic environments.
> This review aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers and
> practitioners in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics.
