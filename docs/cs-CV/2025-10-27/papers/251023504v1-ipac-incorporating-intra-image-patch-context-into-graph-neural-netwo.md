## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Graph neural networks have emerged as a promising paradigm for image
> processing, yet their performance in image classification tasks is hindered by
> a limited consideration of the underlying structure and relationships among
> visual entities. This work presents iPac, a novel approach to introduce a new
> graph representation of images to enhance graph neural network image
> classification by recognizing the importance of underlying structure and
> relationships in medical image classification. iPac integrates various stages,
> including patch partitioning, feature extraction, clustering, graph
> construction, and graph-based learning, into a unified network to advance graph
> neural network image classification. By capturing relevant features and
> organising them into clusters, we construct a meaningful graph representation
> that effectively encapsulates the semantics of the image. Experimental
> evaluation on diverse medical image datasets demonstrates the efficacy of iPac,
> exhibiting an average accuracy improvement of up to 5% over baseline methods.
> Our approach offers a versatile and generic solution for image classification,
> particularly in the realm of medical images, by leveraging the graph
> representation and accounting for the inherent structure and relationships
> among visual entities.
