## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper introduces an intelligent water-saving irrigation system designed
> to address critical challenges in precision agriculture, such as inefficient
> water use and poor terrain adaptability. The system integrates advanced
> computer vision, robotic control, and real-time stabilization technologies via
> a multi-sensor fusion approach. A lightweight YOLO model, deployed on an
> embedded vision processor (K210), enables real-time plant container detection
> with over 96% accuracy under varying lighting conditions. A simplified hand-eye
> calibration algorithm-designed for 'handheld camera' robot arm
> configurations-ensures that the end effector can be precisely positioned, with
> a success rate exceeding 90%. The active leveling system, driven by the
> STM32F103ZET6 main control chip and JY901S inertial measurement data, can
> stabilize the irrigation platform on slopes up to 10 degrees, with a response
> time of 1.8 seconds. Experimental results across three simulated agricultural
> environments (standard greenhouse, hilly terrain, complex lighting) demonstrate
> a 30-50% reduction in water consumption compared to conventional flood
> irrigation, with water use efficiency exceeding 92% in all test cases.
