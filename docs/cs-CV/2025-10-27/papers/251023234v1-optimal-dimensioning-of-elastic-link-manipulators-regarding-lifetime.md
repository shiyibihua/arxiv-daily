## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Resourceful operation and design of robots is key for sustainable industrial
> automation. This will be enabled by lightweight design along with time and
> energy optimal control of robotic manipulators. Design and control of such
> systems is intertwined as the control must take into account inherent
> mechanical compliance while the design must accommodate the dynamic
> requirements demanded by the control. As basis for such design optimization, a
> method for estimating the lifetime of elastic link robotic manipulators is
> presented. This is applied to the geometry optimization of flexible serial
> manipulators performing pick-and-place operations, where the optimization
> objective is a combination of overall weight and vibration amplitudes. The
> lifetime estimation draws from a fatigue analysis combining the rainflow
> counting algorithm and the method of critical cutting plane. Tresca hypothesis
> is used to formulate an equivalent stress, and linear damage accumulation is
> assumed. The final robot geometry is selected from a Pareto front as a tradeoff
> of lifetime and vibration characteristic. The method is illustrated for a three
> degrees of freedom articulated robotic manipulator.
