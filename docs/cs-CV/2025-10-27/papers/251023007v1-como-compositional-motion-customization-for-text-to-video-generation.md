## 📄 摘要（原文）

> While recent text-to-video models excel at generating diverse scenes, they
> struggle with precise motion control, particularly for complex, multi-subject
> motions. Although methods for single-motion customization have been developed
> to address this gap, they fail in compositional scenarios due to two primary
> challenges: motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion
> blending. This paper introduces CoMo, a novel framework for
> $\textbf{compositional motion customization}$ in text-to-video generation,
> enabling the synthesis of multiple, distinct motions within a single video.
> CoMo addresses these issues through a two-phase approach. First, in the
> single-motion learning phase, a static-dynamic decoupled tuning paradigm
> disentangles motion from appearance to learn a motion-specific module. Second,
> in the multi-motion composition phase, a plug-and-play divide-and-merge
> strategy composes these learned motions without additional training by
> spatially isolating their influence during the denoising process. To facilitate
> research in this new domain, we also introduce a new benchmark and a novel
> evaluation metric designed to assess multi-motion fidelity and blending.
> Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoMo achieves state-of-the-art
> performance, significantly advancing the capabilities of controllable video
> generation. Our project page is at https://como6.github.io/.
