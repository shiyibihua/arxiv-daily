## 💡 一句话要点

**提出AdaSDE以加速扩散采样，平衡ODE与SDE的误差问题**

**关键词**: `扩散模型` `采样加速` `误差修正` `轻量蒸馏` `SDE求解器`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：ODE和SDE求解器在扩散采样中存在梯度误差和离散化误差的互补弱点
2. 方法要点：引入可学习系数动态调节误差修正强度，通过轻量蒸馏估计
3. 实验或效果：在5 NFE下，CIFAR-10 FID为4.18，FFHQ为8.05，LSUN Bedroom为6.96

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Diffusion-based generative processes, formulated as differential equation
> solving, frequently balance computational speed with sample quality. Our
> theoretical investigation of ODE- and SDE-based solvers reveals complementary
> weaknesses: ODE solvers accumulate irreducible gradient error along
> deterministic trajectories, while SDE methods suffer from amplified
> discretization errors when the step budget is limited. Building upon this
> insight, we introduce AdaSDE, a novel single-step SDE solver that aims to unify
> the efficiency of ODEs with the error resilience of SDEs. Specifically, we
> introduce a single per-step learnable coefficient, estimated via lightweight
> distillation, which dynamically regulates the error correction strength to
> accelerate diffusion sampling. Notably, our framework can be integrated with
> existing solvers to enhance their capabilities. Extensive experiments
> demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: at 5 NFE, AdaSDE achieves FID scores
> of 4.18 on CIFAR-10, 8.05 on FFHQ and 6.96 on LSUN Bedroom. Codes are available
> in https://github.com/WLU-wry02/AdaSDE.
