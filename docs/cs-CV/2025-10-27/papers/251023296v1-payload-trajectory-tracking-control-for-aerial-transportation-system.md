## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Cable-suspended aerial transportation systems are employed extensively across
> various industries. The capability to flexibly adjust the relative position
> between the multirotor and the payload has spurred growing interest in the
> system equipped with variable-length cable, promising broader application
> potential. Compared to systems with fixed-length cables, introducing the
> variable-length cable adds a new degree of freedom. However, it also results in
> increased nonlinearity and more complex dynamic coupling among the multirotor,
> the cable and the payload, posing significant challenges in control design.
> This paper introduces a backstepping control strategy tailored for aerial
> transportation systems with variable-length cable, designed to precisely track
> the payload trajectory while dynamically adjusting cable length. Then, a cable
> length generator has been developed that achieves online optimization of the
> cable length while satisfying state constraints, thus balancing the
> multirotor's motion and cable length changes without the need for manual
> trajectory planning. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is
> guaranteed through Lyapunov techniques and the growth restriction condition.
> Finally, simulation results confirm the efficacy of the proposed method in
> managing trajectory tracking and cable length adjustments effectively.
