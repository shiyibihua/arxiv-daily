## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Super resolution offers a way to harness medium even lowresolution but
> historically valuable remote sensing image archives. Generative models,
> especially diffusion models, have recently been applied to remote sensing super
> resolution (RSSR), yet several challenges exist. First, diffusion models are
> effective but require expensive training from scratch resources and have slow
> inference speeds. Second, current methods have limited utilization of auxiliary
> information as real-world constraints to reconstruct scientifically realistic
> images. Finally, most current methods lack evaluation on downstream tasks. In
> this study, we present a efficient LSSR framework for RSSR, supported by a new
> multimodal dataset of paired 30 m Landsat 8 and 10 m Sentinel 2 imagery. Built
> on frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, LSSR integrates crossmodal attention
> with auxiliary knowledge (Digital Elevation Model, land cover, month) and
> Synthetic Aperture Radar guidance, enhanced by adapters and a tailored Fourier
> NDVI loss to balance spatial details and spectral fidelity. Extensive
> experiments demonstrate that LSSR significantly improves crop boundary
> delineation and recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with Peak
> Signal-to-Noise Ratio/Structural Similarity Index Measure of 32.63/0.84 (RGB)
> and 23.99/0.78 (IR), and the lowest NDVI Mean Squared Error (0.042), while
> maintaining efficient inference (0.39 sec/image). Moreover, LSSR transfers
> effectively to NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS) super resolution,
> yielding more reliable crop classification (F1: 0.86) than Sentinel-2 (F1:
> 0.85). These results highlight the potential of RSSR to advance precision
> agriculture.
