## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This study presents a novel workflow designed to efficiently and accurately
> register large-scale mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds to a target model
> point cloud in urban street scenarios. This workflow specifically targets the
> complexities inherent in urban environments and adeptly addresses the
> challenges of integrating point clouds that vary in density, noise
> characteristics, and occlusion scenarios, which are common in bustling city
> centers. Two methodological advancements are introduced. First, the proposed
> Semi-sphere Check (SSC) preprocessing technique optimally fragments MLS
> trajectory data by identifying mutually orthogonal planar surfaces. This step
> reduces the impact of MLS drift on the accuracy of the entire point cloud
> registration, while ensuring sufficient geometric features within each fragment
> to avoid local minima. Second, we propose Planar Voxel-based Generalized
> Iterative Closest Point (PV-GICP), a fine registration method that selectively
> utilizes planar surfaces within voxel partitions. This pre-process strategy not
> only improves registration accuracy but also reduces computation time by more
> than 50% compared to conventional point-to-plane ICP methods. Experiments on
> real-world datasets from Munich's inner city demonstrate that our workflow
> achieves sub-0.01 m average registration accuracy while significantly
> shortening processing times. The results underscore the potential of the
> proposed methods to advance automated 3D urban modeling and updating, with
> direct applications in urban planning, infrastructure management, and dynamic
> city monitoring.
