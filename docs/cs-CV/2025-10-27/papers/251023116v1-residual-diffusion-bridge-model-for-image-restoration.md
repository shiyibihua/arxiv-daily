## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Diffusion bridge models establish probabilistic paths between arbitrary
> paired distributions and exhibit great potential for universal image
> restoration. Most existing methods merely treat them as simple variants of
> stochastic interpolants, lacking a unified analytical perspective. Besides,
> they indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection and
> removal, inevitably distorting undegraded regions due to imperfect
> reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose the Residual Diffusion
> Bridge Model (RDBM). Specifically, we theoretically reformulate the stochastic
> differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge and derive the
> analytical formulas of its forward and reverse processes. Crucially, we
> leverage the residuals from given distributions to modulate the noise injection
> and removal, enabling adaptive restoration of degraded regions while preserving
> intact others. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence of
> existing bridge models, all of which are special cases of RDBM and empirically
> demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Extensive experiments are
> conducted to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method both
> qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse image restoration tasks. Code
> is publicly available at https://github.com/MiliLab/RDBM.
