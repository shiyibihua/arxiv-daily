## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Planar tracking has drawn increasing interest owing to its key roles in
> robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent great advancement, further
> development of planar tracking, particularly in the deep learning era, is
> largely limited compared to generic tracking due to the lack of large-scale
> platforms. To mitigate this, we propose PlanarTrack, a large-scale high-quality
> and challenging benchmark for planar tracking. Specifically, PlanarTrack
> consists of 1,150 sequences with over 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term
> and 150 new long-term videos, which enables comprehensive evaluation of short-
> and long-term tracking performance. All videos in PlanarTrack are recorded in
> unconstrained conditions from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack challenging but
> more realistic for real-world applications. To ensure high-quality annotations,
> each video frame is manually annotated by four corner points with multi-round
> meticulous inspection and refinement. To enhance target diversity of
> PlanarTrack, we only capture a unique target in one sequence, which is
> different from existing benchmarks. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack is by
> far the largest and most diverse and challenging dataset dedicated to planar
> tracking. To understand performance of existing methods on PlanarTrack and to
> provide a comparison for future research, we evaluate 10 representative planar
> trackers with extensive comparison and in-depth analysis. Our evaluation
> reveals that, unsurprisingly, the top planar trackers heavily degrade on the
> challenging PlanarTrack, which indicates more efforts are required for
> improving planar tracking. Our data and results will be released at
