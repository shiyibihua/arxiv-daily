## 💡 一句话要点

**提出InFlux基准以解决动态相机内参自校准的评估问题**

**关键词**: `相机内参自校准` `动态内参基准` `视频3D理解` `Kalibr工具扩展` `逐帧标注`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有3D算法假设相机内参恒定，但真实视频中内参常变，缺乏动态内参基准。
2. 方法要点：构建InFlux基准，提供逐帧真实内参标注，扩展Kalibr工具提升精度。
3. 实验或效果：评估基线方法，发现多数在动态内参视频上预测不准，基准含143K+帧。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Accurately tracking camera intrinsics is crucial for achieving 3D
> understanding from 2D video. However, most 3D algorithms assume that camera
> intrinsics stay constant throughout a video, which is often not true for many
> real-world in-the-wild videos. A major obstacle in this field is a lack of
> dynamic camera intrinsics benchmarks--existing benchmarks typically offer
> limited diversity in scene content and intrinsics variation, and none provide
> per-frame intrinsic changes for consecutive video frames. In this paper, we
> present Intrinsics in Flux (InFlux), a real-world benchmark that provides
> per-frame ground truth intrinsics annotations for videos with dynamic
> intrinsics. Compared to prior benchmarks, InFlux captures a wider range of
> intrinsic variations and scene diversity, featuring 143K+ annotated frames from
> 386 high-resolution indoor and outdoor videos with dynamic camera intrinsics.
> To ensure accurate per-frame intrinsics, we build a comprehensive lookup table
> of calibration experiments and extend the Kalibr toolbox to improve its
> accuracy and robustness. Using our benchmark, we evaluate existing baseline
> methods for predicting camera intrinsics and find that most struggle to achieve
> accurate predictions on videos with dynamic intrinsics. For the dataset, code,
> videos, and submission, please visit https://influx.cs.princeton.edu/.
