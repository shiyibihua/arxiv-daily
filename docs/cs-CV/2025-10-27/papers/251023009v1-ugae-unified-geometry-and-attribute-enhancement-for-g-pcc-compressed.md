## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Lossy compression of point clouds reduces storage and transmission costs;
> however, it inevitably leads to irreversible distortion in geometry structure
> and attribute information. To address these issues, we propose a unified
> geometry and attribute enhancement (UGAE) framework, which consists of three
> core components: post-geometry enhancement (PoGE), pre-attribute enhancement
> (PAE), and post-attribute enhancement (PoAE). In PoGE, a Transformer-based
> sparse convolutional U-Net is used to reconstruct the geometry structure with
> high precision by predicting voxel occupancy probabilities. Building on the
> refined geometry structure, PAE introduces an innovative enhanced
> geometry-guided recoloring strategy, which uses a detail-aware K-Nearest
> Neighbors (DA-KNN) method to achieve accurate recoloring and effectively
> preserve high-frequency details before attribute compression. Finally, at the
> decoder side, PoAE uses an attribute residual prediction network with a
> weighted mean squared error (W-MSE) loss to enhance the quality of
> high-frequency regions while maintaining the fidelity of low-frequency regions.
> UGAE significantly outperformed existing methods on three benchmark datasets:
> 8iVFB, Owlii, and MVUB. Compared to the latest G-PCC test model (TMC13v29),
> UGAE achieved an average BD-PSNR gain of 9.98 dB and 90.98% BD-bitrate savings
> for geometry under the D1 metric, as well as a 3.67 dB BD-PSNR improvement with
> 56.88% BD-bitrate savings for attributes on the Y component. Additionally, it
> improved perceptual quality significantly.
