## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Annotating real-world LiDAR point clouds for use in intelligent autonomous
> systems is costly. To overcome this limitation, self-training-based
> Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has been widely used to improve point
> cloud semantic segmentation by leveraging synthetic point cloud data. However,
> we argue that existing methods do not effectively utilize unlabeled data, as
> they either rely on predefined or fixed confidence thresholds, resulting in
> suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Pseudo-Label
> Filtering (DPLF) scheme to enhance real data utilization in point cloud UDA
> semantic segmentation. Additionally, we design a simple and efficient
> Prior-Guided Data Augmentation Pipeline (PG-DAP) to mitigate domain shift
> between synthetic and real-world point clouds. Finally, we utilize data mixing
> consistency loss to push the model to learn context-free representations. We
> implement and thoroughly evaluate our approach through extensive comparisons
> with state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on two challenging synthetic-to-real
> point cloud semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves
> superior performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the DPLF
> and PG-DAP modules. We release the code of our method in this paper.
