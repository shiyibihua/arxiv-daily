## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are gaining attention for their
> ability to embed physical laws into deep learning models, which is particularly
> useful in structural engineering tasks with limited data. This paper aims to
> explore the use of PINNs to predict the weight of small scale spaghetti
> bridges, a task relevant to understanding load limits and potential failure
> modes in simplified structural models. Our proposed framework incorporates
> physics-based constraints to the prediction model for improved performance. In
> addition to standard PINNs, we introduce a novel architecture named Physics
> Informed Kolmogorov Arnold Network (PIKAN), which blends universal function
> approximation theory with physical insights. The structural parameters provided
> as input to the model are collected either manually or through computer vision
> methods. Our dataset includes 15 real bridges, augmented to 100 samples, and
> our best model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.9603 and a mean absolute error
> (MAE) of 10.50 units. From applied perspective, we also provide a web based
> interface for parameter entry and prediction. These results show that PINNs can
> offer reliable estimates of structural weight, even with limited data, and may
> help inform early stage failure analysis in lightweight bridge designs.
