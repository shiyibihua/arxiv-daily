## 💡 一句话要点

**提出BrainFound基础模型以提升3D脑MRI的泛化性和诊断准确性**

**关键词**: `3D脑MRI` `自监督学习` `基础模型` `多模态输入` `疾病检测` `图像分割`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：传统方法依赖单切片和大量标注，难以泛化到不同成像协议和临床场景。
2. 方法要点：基于DINO-v2扩展，自监督学习3D脑解剖，支持单模态和多模态输入。
3. 实验或效果：在标签稀缺和多对比度设置中优于现有方法，提高诊断准确性和减少标注依赖。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Foundation models in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical
> imaging by enabling general-purpose feature learning from large-scale,
> unlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised
> foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision
> transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts
> DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information
> from sequential MRI slices, moving beyond conventional single-slice paradigms.
> It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of
> downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while
> generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show
> that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining
> strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and
> multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI
> modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces
> dependency on extensive expert annotations. This flexibility makes BrainFound a
> scalable and practical solution for 3D neuroimaging pipelines, with significant
> potential for clinical deployment and research innovation.
