## 📄 摘要（原文）

> In multi-sensor systems, time synchronization between sensors is a
> significant challenge, and this issue is particularly pronounced in underwater
> integrated navigation systems incorporating acoustic positioning. Such systems
> are highly susceptible to time delay, which can significantly degrade accuracy
> when measurement and fusion moments are misaligned. To address this challenge,
> this paper introduces a tightly coupled navigation framework that integrates a
> passive inverted ultra-short baseline (piUSBL) acoustic positioning system, a
> strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS), and a depth gauge under precise
> time synchronization. The framework fuses azimuth and slant range from the
> piUSBL with depth data, thereby avoiding poor vertical-angle observability in
> planar arrays. A novel delay measurement strategy is introduced, combining
> synchronized timing with acoustic signal processing, which redefines
> delay-traditionally an unobservable error-into a quantifiable parameter,
> enabling explicit estimation of both acoustic propagation and system processing
> delays. Simulations and field experiments confirm the feasibility of the
> proposed method, with delay-compensated navigation reducing RMSE by 40.45% and
> maximum error by 32.55%. These findings show that precise delay measurement and
> compensation not only enhance underwater navigation accuracy but also establish
> a generalizable framework for acoustic positioning integration, offering
> valuable insights into time alignment and data fusion in latency-sensitive
> multi-sensor systems.
