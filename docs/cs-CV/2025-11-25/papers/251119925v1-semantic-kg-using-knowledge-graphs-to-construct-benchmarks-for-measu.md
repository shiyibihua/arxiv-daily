## 💡 一句话要点

**提出基于知识图谱的基准构建方法，以评估大语言模型输出的语义相似性。**

**关键词**: `语义相似性评估` `知识图谱基准` `大语言模型输出` `多领域数据集` `LLM作为评判者`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 当前语义相似性方法可能偏向句法而非语义，且基准生成成本高、可用性有限。
2. 利用知识图谱生成语义相似或不相似的语句对，并分类不相似子类型。
3. 在多个领域生成数据集，比较方法性能，发现无方法始终最优，影响LLM作为评判者的使用。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Evaluating the open-form textual responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) typically requires measuring the semantic similarity of the response to a (human generated) reference. However, there is evidence that current semantic similarity methods may capture syntactic or lexical forms over semantic content. While benchmarks exist for semantic equivalence, they often suffer from high generation costs due to reliance on subjective human judgment, limited availability for domain-specific applications, and unclear definitions of equivalence. This paper introduces a novel method for generating benchmarks to evaluate semantic similarity methods for LLM outputs, specifically addressing these limitations. Our approach leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate pairs of natural-language statements that are semantically similar or dissimilar, with dissimilar pairs categorized into one of four sub-types. We generate benchmark datasets in four different domains (general knowledge, biomedicine, finance, biology), and conduct a comparative study of semantic similarity methods including traditional natural language processing scores and LLM-as-a-judge predictions. We observe that the sub-type of semantic variation, as well as the domain of the benchmark impact the performance of semantic similarity methods, with no method being consistently superior. Our results present important implications for the use of LLM-as-a-judge in detecting the semantic content of text.
