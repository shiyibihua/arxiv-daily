## 💡 一句话要点

**提出心理测量提示法以评估大语言模型在任务中的模拟自我效能**

**关键词**: `大语言模型` `自我效能评估` `心理测量提示` `任务性能` `人机交互` `模型可靠性`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：大语言模型的自我评估是否可靠反映其实际能力。
2. 方法要点：改编通用自我效能量表，在四种条件下测试十种模型。
3. 实验效果：自我评估稳定但未校准，高自信模型总结能力弱。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Self-assessment is a key aspect of reliable intelligence, yet evaluations of large language models (LLMs) focus mainly on task accuracy. We adapted the 10-item General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) to elicit simulated self-assessments from ten LLMs across four conditions: no task, computational reasoning, social reasoning, and summarization. GSES responses were highly stable across repeated administrations and randomized item orders. However, models showed significantly different self-efficacy levels across conditions, with aggregate scores lower than human norms. All models achieved perfect accuracy on computational and social questions, whereas summarization performance varied widely. Self-assessment did not reliably reflect ability: several low-scoring models performed accurately, while some high-scoring models produced weaker summaries. Follow-up confidence prompts yielded modest, mostly downward revisions, suggesting mild overestimation in first-pass assessments. Qualitative analysis showed that higher self-efficacy corresponded to more assertive, anthropomorphic reasoning styles, whereas lower scores reflected cautious, de-anthropomorphized explanations. Psychometric prompting provides structured insight into LLM communication behavior but not calibrated performance estimates.
