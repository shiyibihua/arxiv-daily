## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The TARK conference (Theoretical Aspects of Rationality and Knowledge) is a conference that aims to bring together researchers from a wide variety of fields, including computer science, artificial intelligence, game theory, decision theory, philosophy, logic, linguistics, and cognitive science. Its goal is to further our understanding of interdisciplinary issues involving reasoning about rationality and knowledge.
>   Previous conferences have been held biennially around the world since 1986, on the initiative of Joe Halpern (Cornell University). Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, semantic models for knowledge, belief, uncertainty, awareness, bounded rationality, common sense epistemic reasoning, epistemic logic, epistemic game theory, knowledge and action, applications of reasoning about knowledge and other mental states, belief revision, computational social choice, algorithmic game theory, and foundations of multi-agent systems.
>   Information about TARK is available at http://www.tark.org/.
>   These proceedings contain the papers that have been accepted for presentation at the Twentieth Conference on Theoretical Aspects of Rationality and Knowledge (TARK 2025), held July 14--16, 2025, at Heinrich-Heine-Universität, Düsseldorf, Germany.
