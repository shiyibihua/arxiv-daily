## 💡 一句话要点

**提出文本失语症电池以评估语言模型中的失语样缺陷**

**关键词**: `语言模型评估` `失语症基准` `文本基准` `自动化评分` `临床适应`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 传统临床评估不适合语言模型，因其假设人类语用压力
2. 基于快速失语症电池设计文本基准，包含四个子测试
3. 自动化评估协议可靠性接近人类评分者，便于大规模使用

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a candidate "model organism" for human language, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study the computational basis of linguistic disorders like aphasia. However, traditional clinical assessments are ill-suited for LLMs, as they presuppose human-like pragmatic pressures and probe cognitive processes not inherent to artificial architectures. We introduce the Text Aphasia Battery (TAB), a text-only benchmark adapted from the Quick Aphasia Battery (QAB) to assess aphasic-like deficits in LLMs. The TAB comprises four subtests: Connected Text, Word Comprehension, Sentence Comprehension, and Repetition. This paper details the TAB's design, subtests, and scoring criteria. To facilitate large-scale use, we validate an automated evaluation protocol using Gemini 2.5 Flash, which achieves reliability comparable to expert human raters (prevalence-weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.255 for model--consensus agreement vs. 0.286 for human--human agreement). We release TAB as a clinically-grounded, scalable framework for analyzing language deficits in artificial systems.
