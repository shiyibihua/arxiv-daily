## 💡 一句话要点

**提出BengaliFig数据集以评估低资源孟加拉语中的比喻和文化推理能力**

**关键词**: `低资源语言处理` `比喻推理` `文化特定推理` `LLM评估` `孟加拉语NLP`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：LLMs在低资源语言中比喻和文化推理评估不足
2. 方法要点：构建435个谜语数据集，多维度标注并自动转换为选择题
3. 实验或效果：评估8个LLMs，揭示隐喻和文化推理弱点

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Large language models excel on broad multilingual benchmarks but remain to be evaluated extensively in figurative and culturally grounded reasoning, especially in low-resource contexts. We present BengaliFig, a compact yet richly annotated challenge set that targets this gap in Bengali, a widely spoken low-resourced language. The dataset contains 435 unique riddles drawn from Bengali oral and literary traditions. Each item is annotated along five orthogonal dimensions capturing reasoning type, trap type, cultural depth, answer category, and difficulty, and is automatically converted to multiple-choice format through a constraint-aware, AI-assisted pipeline. We evaluate eight frontier LLMs from major providers under zero-shot and few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, revealing consistent weaknesses in metaphorical and culturally specific reasoning. BengaliFig thus contributes both a diagnostic probe for evaluating LLM robustness in low-resource cultural contexts and a step toward inclusive and heritage-aware NLP evaluation.
