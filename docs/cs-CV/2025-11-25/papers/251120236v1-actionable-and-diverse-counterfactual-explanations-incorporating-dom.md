## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Counterfactual explanations enhance the actionable interpretability of machine learning models by identifying the minimal changes required to achieve a desired outcome of the model. However, existing methods often ignore the complex dependencies in real-world datasets, leading to unrealistic or impractical modifications. Motivated by cybersecurity applications in the email marketing domain, we propose a method for generating Diverse, Actionable, and kNowledge-Constrained Explanations (DANCE), which incorporates feature dependencies and causal constraints to ensure plausibility and real-world feasibility of counterfactuals. Our method learns linear and nonlinear constraints from data or integrates expert-provided dependency graphs, ensuring counterfactuals are plausible and actionable. By maintaining consistency with feature relationships, the method produces explanations that align with real-world constraints. Additionally, it balances plausibility, diversity, and sparsity, effectively addressing key limitations in existing algorithms. The work is developed based on a real-life case study with Freshmail, the largest email marketing company in Poland and supported by a joint R&D project Sendguard. Furthermore, we provide an extensive evaluation using 140 public datasets, which highlights its ability to generate meaningful, domain-relevant counterfactuals that outperform other existing approaches based on widely used metrics. The source code for reproduction of the results can be found in a GitHub repository we provide.
