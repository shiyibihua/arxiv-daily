**关键词**: `小样本学习` `对比学习` `表格数据` `神经网络正则化` `回归任务`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 神经网络在小样本表格数据集上表现不佳，树模型仍占主导。
2. 结合置换对比损失和Tikhonov闭式输出映射，实现自适应正则化。
3. 在85个真实回归数据集上显著提升性能，尤其适用于残差模型。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Neural networks struggle on small tabular datasets, where tree-based models remain dominant. We introduce Adaptive Contrastive Approach (AdaCap), a training scheme that combines a permutation-based contrastive loss with a Tikhonov-based closed-form output mapping. Across 85 real-world regression datasets and multiple architectures, AdaCap yields consistent and statistically significant improvements in the small-sample regime, particularly for residual models. A meta-predictor trained on dataset characteristics (size, skewness, noise) accurately anticipates when AdaCap is beneficial. These results show that AdaCap acts as a targeted regularization mechanism, strengthening neural networks precisely where they are most fragile. All results and code are publicly available at https://github.com/BrunoBelucci/adacap.
