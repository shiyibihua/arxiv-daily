2. 方法要点：类向量在潜在空间捕获类特定表示调整，支持特征引导或权重更新实现编辑。
3. 实验或效果：验证在遗忘、环境适应、对抗防御和触发优化等应用中的有效性。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Image classifiers play a critical role in detecting diseases in medical
> imaging and identifying anomalies in manufacturing processes. However, their
> predefined behaviors after extensive training make post hoc model editing
> difficult, especially when it comes to forgetting specific classes or adapting
> to distribution shifts. Existing classifier editing methods either focus
> narrowly on correcting errors or incur extensive retraining costs, creating a
> bottleneck for flexible editing. Moreover, such editing has seen limited
> investigation in image classification. To overcome these challenges, we
> introduce Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation
> adjustments during fine-tuning. Whereas task vectors encode task-level changes
> in weight space, Class Vectors disentangle each class's adaptation in the
> latent space. We show that Class Vectors capture each class's semantic shift
> and that classifier editing can be achieved either by steering latent features
> along these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update the decision
> boundaries. We also demonstrate that the inherent linearity and orthogonality
> of Class Vectors support efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing
> via simple class arithmetic. Finally, we validate their utility in applications
> such as unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and
> adversarial trigger optimization.
