## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) is a critical task in computer vision
> that enables models to recognize unseen combinations of known attributes and
> objects during inference, addressing the combinatorial challenge of requiring
> training data for every possible composition. This is particularly challenging
> because the visual appearance of primitives is highly contextual; for example,
> ``small'' cats appear visually distinct from ``older'' ones, and ``wet'' cars
> differ significantly from ``wet'' cats. Effectively modeling this contextuality
> and the inherent compositionality is crucial for robust compositional zero-shot
> recognition. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive
> survey specifically focused on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. We
> systematically review the state-of-the-art CZSL methods, introducing a taxonomy
> grounded in disentanglement, with four families of approaches: no explicit
> disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and
> cross-modal disentanglement. We provide a detailed comparative analysis of
> these methods, highlighting their core advantages and limitations in different
> problem settings, such as closed-world and open-world CZSL. Finally, we
> identify the most significant open challenges and outline promising future
> research directions. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource to
> guide and inspire further advancements in this fascinating and important field.
