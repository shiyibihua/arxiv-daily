## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Robot person following (RPF) is a core capability in human-robot interaction,
> enabling robots to assist users in daily activities, collaborative work, and
> other service scenarios. However, achieving practical RPF remains challenging
> due to frequent occlusions, particularly in dynamic and crowded environments.
> Existing approaches often rely on fixed-point following or sparse
> candidate-point selection with oversimplified heuristics, which cannot
> adequately handle complex occlusions caused by moving obstacles such as
> pedestrians. To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive trajectory
> sampling method that generates dense candidate points within socially aware
> zones and evaluates them using a multi-objective cost function. Based on the
> optimal point, a person-following trajectory is estimated relative to the
> predicted motion of the target. We further design a prediction-aware model
> predictive path integral (MPPI) controller that simultaneously tracks this
> trajectory and proactively avoids collisions using predicted pedestrian
> motions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
> state-of-the-art baselines in smoothness, safety, robustness, and human
> comfort, with its effectiveness further demonstrated on a mobile robot in
> real-world scenarios.
