## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Trackers and video generators solve closely related problems: the former
> analyze motion, while the latter synthesize it. We show that this connection
> enables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking
> by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We
> place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the
> rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker
> across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker
> remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being
> unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative
> prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion
> models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior
> zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance
> that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.
