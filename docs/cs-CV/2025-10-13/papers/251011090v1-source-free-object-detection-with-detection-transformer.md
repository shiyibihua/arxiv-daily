## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source
> domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to
> source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional
> object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions
> without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection
> Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd
> Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically
> designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK
> comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting
> (OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale
> encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize
> less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory
> Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks,
> enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted
> Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature
> distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion;
> and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating
> Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these
> components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a
> target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive
> experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method
> achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and
> compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.
