## 💡 一句话要点

**提出IVEBench基准套件以解决指令引导视频编辑评估不足的问题**

**关键词**: `指令引导视频编辑` `视频编辑基准` `多模态评估` `视频质量评估` `指令合规性`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 现有视频编辑基准在指令引导评估上不足，存在源视频多样性低、任务覆盖窄和指标不完整问题
2. 构建包含600个高质量源视频、8类编辑任务和三维评估协议的基准套件
3. 实验显示IVEBench能全面评估先进方法，提供与人类对齐的评价结果

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Instruction-guided video editing has emerged as a rapidly advancing research
> direction, offering new opportunities for intuitive content transformation
> while also posing significant challenges for systematic evaluation. Existing
> video editing benchmarks fail to support the evaluation of instruction-guided
> video editing adequately and further suffer from limited source diversity,
> narrow task coverage and incomplete evaluation metrics. To address the above
> limitations, we introduce IVEBench, a modern benchmark suite specifically
> designed for instruction-guided video editing assessment. IVEBench comprises a
> diverse database of 600 high-quality source videos, spanning seven semantic
> dimensions, and covering video lengths ranging from 32 to 1,024 frames. It
> further includes 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories, whose
> prompts are generated and refined through large language models and expert
> review. Crucially, IVEBench establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol
> encompassing video quality, instruction compliance and video fidelity,
> integrating both traditional metrics and multimodal large language model-based
> assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IVEBench in
> benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, showing
> its ability to provide comprehensive and human-aligned evaluation outcomes.
