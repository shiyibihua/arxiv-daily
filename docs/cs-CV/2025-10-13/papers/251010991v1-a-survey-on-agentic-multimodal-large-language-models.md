## 📄 摘要（原文）

> With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems,
> research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static,
> passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and
> generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and
> its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on
> Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we
> explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual
> foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based
> agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along
> three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as
> the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through
> reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation,
> whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their
> problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii)
> Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or
> physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and
> sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further
> accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source
> training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic
> MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and
> outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To
> continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also
> actively update a public repository at
> https://github.com/HJYao00/Awesome-Agentic-MLLMs.
