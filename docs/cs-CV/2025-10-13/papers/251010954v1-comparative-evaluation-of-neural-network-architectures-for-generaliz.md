## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The capacity to predict human spatial preferences within built environments
> is instrumental for developing Cyber-Physical-Social Infrastructure Systems
> (CPSIS). A significant challenge in this domain is the generalizability of
> preference models, particularly their efficacy in predicting preferences within
> environmental configurations not encountered during training. While deep
> learning models have shown promise in learning complex spatial and contextual
> dependencies, it remains unclear which neural network architectures are most
> effective at generalizing to unseen layouts. To address this, we conduct a
> comparative study of Graph Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and
> standard feedforward Neural Networks using synthetic data generated from a
> simplified and synthetic pocket park environment. Beginning with this
> illustrative case study, allows for controlled analysis of each model's ability
> to transfer learned preference patterns to unseen spatial scenarios. The models
> are evaluated based on their capacity to predict preferences influenced by
> heterogeneous physical, environmental, and social features. Generalizability
> score is calculated using the area under the precision-recall curve for the
> seen and unseen layouts. This generalizability score is appropriate for
> imbalanced data, providing insights into the suitability of each neural network
> architecture for preference-aware human behavior modeling in unseen built
> environments.
