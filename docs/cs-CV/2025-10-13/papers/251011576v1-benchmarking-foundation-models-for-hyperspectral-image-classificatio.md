## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Foundation models are transforming Earth observation, but their potential for
> hyperspectral crop mapping remains underexplored. This study benchmarks three
> foundation models for cereal crop mapping using hyperspectral imagery:
> HyperSigma, DOFA, and Vision Transformers pre-trained on the SpectralEarth
> dataset (a large multitemporal hyperspectral archive). Models were fine-tuned
> on manually labeled data from a training region and evaluated on an independent
> test region. Performance was measured with overall accuracy (OA), average
> accuracy (AA), and F1-score. HyperSigma achieved an OA of 34.5% (+/- 1.8%),
> DOFA reached 62.6% (+/- 3.5%), and the SpectralEarth model achieved an OA of
> 93.5% (+/- 0.8%). A compact SpectralEarth variant trained from scratch achieved
> 91%, highlighting the importance of model architecture for strong
> generalization across geographic regions and sensor platforms. These results
> provide a systematic evaluation of foundation models for operational
> hyperspectral crop mapping and outline directions for future model development.
