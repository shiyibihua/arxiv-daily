## 📄 摘要（原文）

> 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for
> high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for
> accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and
> unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering
> loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment.
> In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric
> representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we
> incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface
> boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we
> introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions
> and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further
> mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based
> constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local
> surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to
> enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned
> geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on
> standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
> performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. The source
> code is available at https://github.com/LeoQLi/VA-GS.
