## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Robots navigating dynamic, cluttered, and semantically complex environments
> must integrate perception, symbolic reasoning, and spatial planning to
> generalize across diverse layouts and object categories. Existing methods often
> rely on static priors or limited memory, constraining adaptability under
> partial observability and semantic ambiguity. We present GRIP, Grid-based Relay
> with Intermediate Planning, a unified, modular framework with three scalable
> variants: GRIP-L (Lightweight), optimized for symbolic navigation via semantic
> occupancy grids; GRIP-F (Full), supporting multi-hop anchor chaining and
> LLM-based introspection; and GRIP-R (Real-World), enabling physical robot
> deployment under perceptual uncertainty. GRIP integrates dynamic 2D grid
> construction, open-vocabulary object grounding, co-occurrence-aware symbolic
> planning, and hybrid policy execution using behavioral cloning, D* search, and
> grid-conditioned control. Empirical results on AI2-THOR and RoboTHOR benchmarks
> show that GRIP achieves up to 9.6% higher success rates and over $2\times$
> improvement in path efficiency (SPL and SAE) on long-horizon tasks. Qualitative
> analyses reveal interpretable symbolic plans in ambiguous scenes. Real-world
> deployment on a Jetbot further validates GRIP's generalization under sensor
> noise and environmental variation. These results position GRIP as a robust,
> scalable, and explainable framework bridging simulation and real-world
> navigation.
