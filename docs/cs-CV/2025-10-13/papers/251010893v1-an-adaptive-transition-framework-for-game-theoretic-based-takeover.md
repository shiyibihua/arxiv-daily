## 💡 一句话要点

**提出自适应控制权转移策略以解决自动驾驶接管中驾驶员准备不足问题**

**关键词**: `自动驾驶接管` `共享控制` `微分游戏` `自适应策略` `驾驶员状态跟踪` `车辆稳定性`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：固定时间转移策略未考虑驾驶员实时性能变化，导致接管反应慢。
2. 方法要点：基于合作微分游戏建模共享控制，动态调整控制权以匹配驾驶员轨迹跟踪。
3. 实验效果：自适应策略减少轨迹偏差和驾驶员控制努力，提升车辆稳定性。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The transition of control from autonomous systems to human drivers is
> critical in automated driving systems, particularly due to the out-of-the-loop
> (OOTL) circumstances that reduce driver readiness and increase reaction times.
> Existing takeover strategies are based on fixed time-based transitions, which
> fail to account for real-time driver performance variations. This paper
> proposes an adaptive transition strategy that dynamically adjusts the control
> authority based on both the time and tracking ability of the driver trajectory.
> Shared control is modeled as a cooperative differential game, where control
> authority is modulated through time-varying objective functions instead of
> blending control torques directly. To ensure a more natural takeover, a
> driver-specific state-tracking matrix is introduced, allowing the transition to
> align with individual control preferences. Multiple transition strategies are
> evaluated using a cumulative trajectory error metric. Human-in-the-loop control
> scenarios of the standardized ISO lane change maneuvers demonstrate that
> adaptive transitions reduce trajectory deviations and driver control effort
> compared to conventional strategies. Experiments also confirm that continuously
> adjusting control authority based on real-time deviations enhances vehicle
> stability while reducing driver effort during takeover.
