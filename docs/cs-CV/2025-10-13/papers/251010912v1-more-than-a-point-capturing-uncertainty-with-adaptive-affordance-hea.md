## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Many language-guided robotic systems rely on collapsing spatial reasoning
> into discrete points, making them brittle to perceptual noise and semantic
> ambiguity. To address this challenge, we propose RoboMAP, a framework that
> represents spatial targets as continuous, adaptive affordance heatmaps. This
> dense representation captures the uncertainty in spatial grounding and provides
> richer information for downstream policies, thereby significantly enhancing
> task success and interpretability. RoboMAP surpasses the previous
> state-of-the-art on a majority of grounding benchmarks with up to a 50x speed
> improvement, and achieves an 82\% success rate in real-world manipulation.
> Across extensive simulated and physical experiments, it demonstrates robust
> performance and shows strong zero-shot generalization to navigation. More
