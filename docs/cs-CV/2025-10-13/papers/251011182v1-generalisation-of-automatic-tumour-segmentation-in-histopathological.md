## 💡 一句话要点

**提出通用肿瘤分割模型，在多种癌症类型中实现高精度分割。**

**关键词**: `肿瘤分割` `深度学习` `组织病理学图像` `多癌症类型` `通用模型`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：开发单一模型在组织病理学全切片图像中通用肿瘤分割，适应不同癌症类型。
2. 方法要点：使用深度学习，基于超过20000张全切片图像训练模型，涵盖四种癌症类型。
3. 实验或效果：在外部验证队列中平均Dice系数超过80%，性能与专用模型相当。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Deep learning is expected to aid pathologists by automating tasks such as
> tumour segmentation. We aimed to develop one universal tumour segmentation
> model for histopathological images and examine its performance in different
> cancer types. The model was developed using over 20 000 whole-slide images from
> over 4 000 patients with colorectal, endometrial, lung, or prostate carcinoma.
> Performance was validated in pre-planned analyses on external cohorts with over
> 3 000 patients across six cancer types. Exploratory analyses included over 1
> 500 additional patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Average Dice coefficient
> was over 80% in all validation cohorts with en bloc resection specimens and in
> The Cancer Genome Atlas cohorts. No loss of performance was observed when
> comparing the universal model with models specialised on single cancer types.
> In conclusion, extensive and rigorous evaluations demonstrate that generic
> tumour segmentation by a single model is possible across cancer types, patient
> populations, sample preparations, and slide scanners.
