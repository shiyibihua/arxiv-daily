## 💡 一句话要点

**提出SeerDrive框架，通过双向建模轨迹规划与场景演化以提升端到端自动驾驶性能**

**关键词**: `端到端自动驾驶` `轨迹规划` `场景演化预测` `鸟瞰图表示` `闭环建模` `双向关系`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：端到端自动驾驶方法依赖当前场景，低估动态演化，限制复杂场景决策能力
2. 方法要点：联合建模未来场景BEV预测与轨迹规划，实现闭环迭代优化
3. 实验或效果：在NAVSIM和nuScenes基准上显著优于现有先进方法

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs
> to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional
> modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often
> operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene
> context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their
> temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make
> informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new
> perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely
> intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the
> vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.
> Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel
> end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory
> planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye
> view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene,
> then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories.
> Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects
> predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene
> modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and
> trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments
> on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly
> outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.
