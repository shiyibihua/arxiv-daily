## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Accurate segmentation of tumors and adjacent normal tissues in medical images
> is essential for surgical planning and tumor staging. Although foundation
> models generally perform well in segmentation tasks, they often struggle to
> focus on foreground areas in complex, low-contrast backgrounds, where some
> malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, complicating contextual
> differentiation. To address these challenges, we propose the Foreground-Aware
> Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework. First, we introduce a foreground-aware
> module to amplify the distinction between background and the entire volume
> space, allowing the model to concentrate more effectively on target areas.
> Next, a feature-level frequency enhancement module, based on wavelet transform,
> extracts discriminative high-frequency features to enhance boundary recognition
> and detail perception. Eventually, we introduce an edge constraint module to
> preserve geometric continuity in segmentation boundaries. Extensive experiments
> on multiple medical datasets demonstrate superior performance across all
> metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in
> robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition. Our
> framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast images, paving
> the way for applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.
