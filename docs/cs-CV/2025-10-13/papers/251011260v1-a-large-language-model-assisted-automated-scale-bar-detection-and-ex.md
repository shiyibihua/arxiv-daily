## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
> are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing
> microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of
> accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual
> operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this
> issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and
> extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection
> and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed
> framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG)
> model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training
> and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii)
> information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
> system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based
> algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The
> proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and
> accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean
> Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The
> hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the
> Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone
> engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is
> introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that
> suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method
> powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of
> scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for
> microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.
