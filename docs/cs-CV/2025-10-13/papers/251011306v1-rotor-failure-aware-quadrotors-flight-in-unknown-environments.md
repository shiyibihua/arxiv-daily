## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Rotor failures in quadrotors may result in high-speed rotation and vibration
> due to rotor imbalance, which introduces significant challenges for autonomous
> flight in unknown environments. The mainstream approaches against rotor
> failures rely on fault-tolerant control (FTC) and predefined trajectory
> tracking. To the best of our knowledge, online failure detection and diagnosis
> (FDD), trajectory planning, and FTC of the post-failure quadrotors in unknown
> and complex environments have not yet been achieved. This paper presents a
> rotor-failure-aware quadrotor navigation system designed to mitigate the
> impacts of rotor imbalance. First, a composite FDD-based nonlinear model
> predictive controller (NMPC), incorporating motor dynamics, is designed to
> ensure fast failure detection and flight stability. Second, a
> rotor-failure-aware planner is designed to leverage FDD results and
> spatial-temporal joint optimization, while a LiDAR-based quadrotor platform
> with four anti-torque plates is designed to enable reliable perception under
> high-speed rotation. Lastly, extensive benchmarks against state-of-the-art
> methods highlight the superior performance of the proposed approach in
> addressing rotor failures, including propeller unloading and motor stoppage.
> The experimental results demonstrate, for the first time, that our approach
> enables autonomous quadrotor flight with rotor failures in challenging
> environments, including cluttered rooms and unknown forests.
