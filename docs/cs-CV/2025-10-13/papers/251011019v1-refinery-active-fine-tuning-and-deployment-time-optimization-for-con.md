## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Simulation-based learning has enabled policies for precise, contact-rich
> tasks (e.g., robotic assembly) to reach high success rates (~80%) under high
> levels of observation noise and control error. Although such performance may be
> sufficient for research applications, it falls short of industry standards and
> makes policy chaining exceptionally brittle. A key limitation is the high
> variance in individual policy performance across diverse initial conditions. We
> introduce Refinery, an effective framework that bridges this performance gap,
> robustifying policy performance across initial conditions. We propose Bayesian
> Optimization-guided fine-tuning to improve individual policies, and Gaussian
> Mixture Model-based sampling during deployment to select initializations that
> maximize execution success. Using Refinery, we improve mean success rates by
> 10.98% over state-of-the-art methods in simulation-based learning for robotic
> assembly, reaching 91.51% in simulation and comparable performance in the real
> world. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these fine-tuned policies can be
> chained to accomplish long-horizon, multi-part
> assembly$\unicode{x2013}$successfully assembling up to 8 parts without
> requiring explicit multi-step training.
