## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Accurate and robust heading estimation is crucial for unmanned aerial
> vehicles (UAVs) when conducting indoor inspection tasks. However, the cluttered
> nature of indoor environments often introduces severe magnetic disturbances,
> which can significantly degrade heading accuracy. To address this challenge,
> this paper presents an Adaptive MARG-Only Heading (AMO-HEAD) estimation
> approach for UAVs operating in magnetically disturbed environments. AMO-HEAD is
> a lightweight and computationally efficient Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
> framework that leverages inertial and magnetic sensors to achieve reliable
> heading estimation. In the proposed approach, gyroscope angular rate
> measurements are integrated to propagate the quaternion state, which is
> subsequently corrected using accelerometer and magnetometer data. The corrected
> quaternion is then used to compute the UAV's heading. An adaptive process noise
> covariance method is introduced to model and compensate for gyroscope
> measurement noise, bias drift, and discretization errors arising from the Euler
> method integration. To mitigate the effects of external magnetic disturbances,
> a scaling factor is applied based on real-time magnetic deviation detection. A
> theoretical observability analysis of the proposed AMO-HEAD is performed using
> the Lie derivative. Extensive experiments were conducted in real world indoor
> environments with customized UAV platforms. The results demonstrate the
> effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in providing precise heading estimation
> under magnetically disturbed conditions.
