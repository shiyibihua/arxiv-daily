## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Embodied intelligence has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years,
> driven by advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and the
> rise of large-scale multimodal models. Among its core challenges, robot
> manipulation stands out as a fundamental yet intricate problem, requiring the
> seamless integration of perception, planning, and control to enable interaction
> within diverse and unstructured environments. This survey presents a
> comprehensive overview of robotic manipulation, encompassing foundational
> background, task-organized benchmarks and datasets, and a unified taxonomy of
> existing methods. We extend the classical division between high-level planning
> and low-level control by broadening high-level planning to include language,
> code, motion, affordance, and 3D representations, while introducing a new
> taxonomy of low-level learning-based control grounded in training paradigms
> such as input modeling, latent learning, and policy learning. Furthermore, we
> provide the first dedicated taxonomy of key bottlenecks, focusing on data
> collection, utilization, and generalization, and conclude with an extensive
> review of real-world applications. Compared with prior surveys, our work offers
> both a broader scope and deeper insight, serving as an accessible roadmap for
> newcomers and a structured reference for experienced researchers. All related
> resources, including research papers, open-source datasets, and projects, are
> curated for the community at
> https://github.com/BaiShuanghao/Awesome-Robotics-Manipulation.
