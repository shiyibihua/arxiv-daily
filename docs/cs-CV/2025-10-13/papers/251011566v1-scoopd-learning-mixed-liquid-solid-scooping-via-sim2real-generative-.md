## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Scooping items with tools such as spoons and ladles is common in daily life,
> ranging from assistive feeding to retrieving items from environmental disaster
> sites. However, developing a general and autonomous robotic scooping policy is
> challenging since it requires reasoning about complex tool-object interactions.
> Furthermore, scooping often involves manipulating deformable objects, such as
> granular media or liquids, which is challenging due to their
> infinite-dimensional configuration spaces and complex dynamics. We propose a
> method, SCOOP'D, which uses simulation from OmniGibson (built on NVIDIA
> Omniverse) to collect scooping demonstrations using algorithmic procedures that
> rely on privileged state information. Then, we use generative policies via
> diffusion to imitate demonstrations from observational input. We directly apply
> the learned policy in diverse real-world scenarios, testing its performance on
> various item quantities, item characteristics, and container types. In
> zero-shot deployment, our method demonstrates promising results across 465
> trials in diverse scenarios, including objects of different difficulty levels
> that we categorize as "Level 1" and "Level 2." SCOOP'D outperforms all
> baselines and ablations, suggesting that this is a promising approach to
> acquiring robotic scooping skills. Project page is at
