## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Flood mapping and water depth estimation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
> imagery are crucial for calibrating and validating hydraulic models. This study
> uses SAR imagery to evaluate various preprocessing (especially speckle noise
> reduction), flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods. The impact of
> the choice of method at different steps and its hyperparameters is studied by
> considering an ensemble of preprocessed images, flood maps, and water depth
> fields. The evaluation is conducted for two flood events on the Garonne River
> (France) in 2019 and 2021, using hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ
> observations as reference data. Results show that the choice of speckle filter
> alters flood extent estimations with variations of several square kilometers.
> Furthermore, the selection and tuning of flood mapping methods also affect
> performance. While supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, tuned
> unsupervised approaches (such as local thresholding or change detection) can
> achieve comparable results. The compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and
> flood mapping steps also introduces high variability in the water depth field
> estimates. This study highlights the importance of considering the entire
> processing pipeline, encompassing preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth
> estimation methods and their associated hyperparameters. Rather than relying on
> a single configuration, adopting an ensemble approach and accounting for
> methodological uncertainty should be privileged. For flood mapping, the method
> choice has the most influence. For water depth estimation, the most influential
> processing step was the flood map input resulting from the flood mapping step
> and the hyperparameters of the methods.
