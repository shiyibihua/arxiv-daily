## 📄 摘要（原文）

> In future intelligent transportation systems, autonomous cooperative planning
> (ACP), becomes a promising technique to increase the effectiveness and security
> of multi-vehicle interactions. However, multiple uncertainties cannot be fully
> addressed for existing ACP strategies, e.g. perception, planning, and
> communication uncertainties. To address these, a novel deep reinforcement
> learning-based autonomous cooperative planning (DRLACP) framework is proposed
> to tackle various uncertainties on cooperative motion planning schemes.
> Specifically, the soft actor-critic (SAC) with the implementation of gate
> recurrent units (GRUs) is adopted to learn the deterministic optimal
> time-varying actions with imperfect state information occurred by planning,
> communication, and perception uncertainties. In addition, the real-time actions
> of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are demonstrated via the Car Learning to Act
> (CARLA) simulation platform. Evaluation results show that the proposed DRLACP
> learns and performs cooperative planning effectively, which outperforms other
> baseline methods under different scenarios with imperfect AV state information.
