## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for
> applications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack
> of rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or
> image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or
> introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address
> this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a
> novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer
> from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD
> models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality
> gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation
> fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To
> overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a
> bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a
> connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich
> RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by
> feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop
> supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are
> semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge
> transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on
> public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while
> drastically reducing computational overhead.
