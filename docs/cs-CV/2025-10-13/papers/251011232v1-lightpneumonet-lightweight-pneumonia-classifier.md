## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Effective pneumonia diagnosis is often challenged by the difficulty of
> deploying large, computationally expensive deep learning models in
> resource-limited settings. This study introduces LightPneumoNet, an efficient,
> lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch to provide an
> accessible and accurate diagnostic solution for pneumonia detection from chest
> X-rays. Our model was trained on a public dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images.
> Preprocessing included image resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, and
> pixel normalization, with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear) to prevent
> overfitting. The custom architecture features four blocks of stacked
> convolutional layers and contains only 388,082 trainable parameters, resulting
> in a minimal 1.48 MB memory footprint. On the independent test set, our model
> delivered exceptional performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.942,
> precision of 0.92, and an F1-Score of 0.96. Critically, it obtained a
> sensitivity (recall) of 0.99, demonstrating a near-perfect ability to identify
> true pneumonia cases and minimize clinically significant false negatives.
> Notably, LightPneumoNet achieves this high recall on the same dataset where
> existing approaches typically require significantly heavier architectures or
> fail to reach comparable sensitivity levels. The model's efficiency enables
> deployment on low-cost hardware, making advanced computer-aided diagnosis
> accessible in underserved clinics and serving as a reliable second-opinion tool
> to improve patient outcomes.
