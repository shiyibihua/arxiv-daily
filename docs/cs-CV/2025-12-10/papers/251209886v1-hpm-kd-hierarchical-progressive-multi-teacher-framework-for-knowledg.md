## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a promising technique for model compression but faces critical limitations: (1) sensitivity to hyperparameters requiring extensive manual tuning, (2) capacity gap when distilling from very large teachers to small students, (3) suboptimal coordination in multi-teacher scenarios, and (4) inefficient use of computational resources. We present \textbf{HPM-KD}, a framework that integrates six synergistic components: (i) Adaptive Configuration Manager via meta-learning that eliminates manual hyperparameter tuning, (ii) Progressive Distillation Chain with automatically determined intermediate models, (iii) Attention-Weighted Multi-Teacher Ensemble that learns dynamic per-sample weights, (iv) Meta-Learned Temperature Scheduler that adapts temperature throughout training, (v) Parallel Processing Pipeline with intelligent load balancing, and (vi) Shared Optimization Memory for cross-experiment reuse. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and tabular datasets demonstrate that HPM-KD: achieves 10x-15x compression while maintaining 85% accuracy retention, eliminates the need for manual tuning, and reduces training time by 30-40% via parallelization. Ablation studies confirm independent contribution of each component (0.10-0.98 pp). HPM-KD is available as part of the open-source DeepBridge library.
