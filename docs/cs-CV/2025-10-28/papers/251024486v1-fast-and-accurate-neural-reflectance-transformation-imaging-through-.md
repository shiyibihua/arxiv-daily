## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) is very popular for its ability to
> visually analyze surfaces by enhancing surface details through interactive
> relighting, starting from only a few tens of photographs taken with a fixed
> camera and variable illumination. Traditional methods like Polynomial Texture
> Maps (PTM) and Hemispherical Harmonics (HSH) are compact and fast, but struggle
> to accurately capture complex reflectance fields using few per-pixel
> coefficients and fixed bases, leading to artifacts, especially in highly
> reflective or shadowed areas. The NeuralRTI approach, which exploits a neural
> autoencoder to learn a compact function that better approximates the local
> reflectance as a function of light directions, has been shown to produce
> superior quality at comparable storage cost. However, as it performs
> interactive relighting with custom decoder networks with many parameters, the
> rendering step is computationally expensive and not feasible at full resolution
> for large images on limited hardware. Earlier attempts to reduce costs by
> directly training smaller networks have failed to produce valid results. For
> this reason, we propose to reduce its computational cost through a novel
> solution based on Knowledge Distillation (DisK-NeuralRTI). ...
