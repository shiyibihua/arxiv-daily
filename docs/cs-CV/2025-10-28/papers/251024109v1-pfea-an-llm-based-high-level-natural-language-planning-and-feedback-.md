2. 框架包含人机语音交互、视觉语言代理和动作执行模块，集成任务规划与反馈评估
3. 实验显示在模拟和真实环境中任务成功率比LLM+CLIP方法提高28%

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked a
> significant breakthrough in Artificial Intelligence (AI), ushering in a new era
> of Human-centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). HAI aims to better serve human
> welfare and needs, thereby placing higher demands on the intelligence level of
> robots, particularly in aspects such as natural language interaction, complex
> task planning, and execution. Intelligent agents powered by LLMs have opened up
> new pathways for realizing HAI. However, existing LLM-based embodied agents
> often lack the ability to plan and execute complex natural language control
> tasks online. This paper explores the implementation of intelligent robotic
> manipulating agents based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in the physical
> world. We propose a novel embodied agent framework for robots, which comprises
> a human-robot voice interaction module, a vision-language agent module and an
> action execution module. The vision-language agent itself includes a
> vision-based task planner, a natural language instruction converter, and a task
> performance feedback evaluator. Experimental results demonstrate that our agent
> achieves a 28\% higher average task success rate in both simulated and real
> environments compared to approaches relying solely on LLM+CLIP, significantly
> improving the execution success rate of high-level natural language instruction
> tasks.
