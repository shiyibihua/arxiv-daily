## 💡 一句话要点

**提出自适应扭转软手指机制，用于在密集物体中通过包裹抓取。**

**关键词**: `软机器人手指` `自适应变形` `可变刚度机制` `包裹抓取` `有限元分析`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：软手在密集物体中抓取单个物体时，需实现自适应扭转变形以深入狭窄间隙。
2. 方法要点：设计可变刚度机制，通过单一驱动源实现自适应扭转和抓取力控制。
3. 实验或效果：进行有限元分析和基础实验，验证机制对多种物体的抓取能力。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper presents a soft robot finger capable of adaptive-twist deformation
> to grasp objects by wrapping them. For a soft hand to grasp and pick-up one
> object from densely contained multiple objects, a soft finger requires the
> adaptive-twist deformation function in both in-plane and out-of-plane
> directions. The function allows the finger to be inserted deeply into a limited
> gap among objects. Once inserted, the soft finger requires appropriate control
> of grasping force normal to contact surface, thereby maintaining the twisted
> deformation. In this paper, we refer to this type of grasping as grasping by
> wrapping. To achieve these two functions by a single actuation source, we
> propose a variable stiffness mechanism that can adaptively change the stiffness
> as the pressure is higher. We conduct a finite element analysis (FEA) on the
> proposed mechanism and determine its design parameter based on the FEA result.
> Using the developed soft finger, we report basic experimental results and
> demonstrations on grasping various objects.
