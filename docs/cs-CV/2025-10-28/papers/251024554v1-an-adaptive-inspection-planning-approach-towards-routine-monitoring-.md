## 💡 一句话要点

**提出分层框架以在不确定环境中实现机器人自适应巡检**

**关键词**: `机器人巡检` `环境不确定性` `分层规划` `自适应控制` `四足机器人` `地下环境`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：环境模型与实际条件差异导致巡检路径失效
2. 方法要点：结合全局视图规划和局部视图重规划以保持覆盖
3. 实验或效果：在真实地下矿井中验证，使用四足机器人完成巡检

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> In this work, we present a hierarchical framework designed to support robotic
> inspection under environment uncertainty. By leveraging a known environment
> model, existing methods plan and safely track inspection routes to visit points
> of interest. However, discrepancies between the model and actual site
> conditions, caused by either natural or human activities, can alter the surface
> morphology or introduce path obstructions. To address this challenge, the
> proposed framework divides the inspection task into: (a) generating the initial
> global view-plan for region of interests based on a historical map and (b)
> local view replanning to adapt to the current morphology of the inspection
> scene. The proposed hierarchy preserves global coverage objectives while
> enabling reactive adaptation to the local surface morphology. This enables the
> local autonomy to remain robust against environment uncertainty and complete
> the inspection tasks. We validate the approach through deployments in
> real-world subterranean mines using quadrupedal robot.
