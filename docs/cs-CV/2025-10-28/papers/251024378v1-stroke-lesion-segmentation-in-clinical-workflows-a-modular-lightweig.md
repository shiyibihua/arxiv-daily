## 💡 一句话要点

**提出StrokeSeg框架，将高性能卒中病灶分割模型转化为可部署的临床应用工具。**

**关键词**: `卒中病灶分割` `模块化框架` `ONNX Runtime` `模型量化` `临床部署` `轻量级工具`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：nnU-Net等深度学习框架依赖重、设计单一，难以临床部署。
2. 方法要点：采用模块化设计，预处理用Anima工具箱，推理用ONNX Runtime并量化模型。
3. 实验或效果：在300例卒中患者数据上，分割性能与原PyTorch管道相当。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Deep learning frameworks such as nnU-Net achieve state-of-the-art performance
> in brain lesion segmentation but remain difficult to deploy clinically due to
> heavy dependencies and monolithic design. We introduce \textit{StrokeSeg}, a
> modular and lightweight framework that translates research-grade stroke lesion
> segmentation models into deployable applications. Preprocessing, inference, and
> postprocessing are decoupled: preprocessing relies on the Anima toolbox with
> BIDS-compliant outputs, and inference uses ONNX Runtime with \texttt{Float16}
> quantisation, reducing model size by about 50\%. \textit{StrokeSeg} provides
> both graphical and command-line interfaces and is distributed as Python scripts
> and as a standalone Windows executable. On a held-out set of 300 sub-acute and
> chronic stroke subjects, segmentation performance was equivalent to the
> original PyTorch pipeline (Dice difference $<10^{-3}$), demonstrating that
> high-performing research pipelines can be transformed into portable, clinically
> usable tools.
