## 💡 一句话要点

**提出系统评估框架以分析机器人避障与物体感知控制器**

**关键词**: `机器人避障` `物体感知控制` `系统评估框架` `运动学分析` `虚拟约束`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：实时控制中机器人避障与物体感知方法缺乏系统评估标准
2. 方法要点：基于运动学、运动轮廓和虚拟约束设计分析框架
3. 实验或效果：通过基础场景验证并比较三种控制器，发现设计不足

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Real-time control is an essential aspect of safe robot operation in the real
> world with dynamic objects. We present a framework for the analysis of
> object-aware controllers, methods for altering a robot's motion to anticipate
> and avoid possible collisions. This framework is focused on three design
> considerations: kinematics, motion profiles, and virtual constraints.
> Additionally, the analysis in this work relies on verification of robot
> behaviors using fundamental robot-obstacle experimental scenarios. To showcase
> the effectiveness of our method we compare three representative object-aware
> controllers. The comparison uses metrics originating from the design
> considerations. From the analysis, we find that the design of object-aware
> controllers often lacks kinematic considerations, continuity of control points,
> and stability in movement profiles. We conclude that this framework can be used
> in the future to design, compare, and benchmark obstacle avoidance methods.
