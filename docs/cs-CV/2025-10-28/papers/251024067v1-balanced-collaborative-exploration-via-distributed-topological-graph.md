## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This work addresses the collaborative multi-robot autonomous online
> exploration problem, particularly focusing on distributed exploration planning
> for dynamically balanced exploration area partition and task allocation among a
> team of mobile robots operating in obstacle-dense non-convex environments.
>   We present a novel topological map structure that simultaneously
> characterizes both spatial connectivity and global exploration completeness of
> the environment. The topological map is updated incrementally to utilize known
> spatial information for updating reachable spaces, while exploration targets
> are planned in a receding horizon fashion under global coverage guidance.
>   A distributed weighted topological graph Voronoi algorithm is introduced
> implementing balanced graph space partitions of the fused topological maps.
> Theoretical guarantees are provided for distributed consensus convergence and
> equitable graph space partitions with constant bounds.
>   A local planner optimizes the visitation sequence of exploration targets
> within the balanced partitioned graph space to minimize travel distance, while
> generating safe, smooth, and dynamically feasible motion trajectories.
>   Comprehensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods demonstrates
> significant improvements in exploration efficiency, completeness, and workload
> balance across the robot team.
