## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Recent advancements in deep learning and the availability of high-quality
> real-world driving datasets have propelled end-to-end autonomous driving.
> Despite this progress, relying solely on real-world data limits the variety of
> driving scenarios for training. Synthetic scenario generation has emerged as a
> promising solution to enrich the diversity of training data; however, its
> application within E2E AD models remains largely unexplored. This is primarily
> due to the absence of a designated ego vehicle and the associated sensor
> inputs, such as camera or LiDAR, typically provided in real-world scenarios. To
> address this gap, we introduce SynAD, the first framework designed to enhance
> real-world E2E AD models using synthetic data. Our method designates the agent
> with the most comprehensive driving information as the ego vehicle in a
> multi-agent synthetic scenario. We further project path-level scenarios onto
> maps and employ a newly developed Map-to-BEV Network to derive bird's-eye-view
> features without relying on sensor inputs. Finally, we devise a training
> strategy that effectively integrates these map-based synthetic data with real
> driving data. Experimental results demonstrate that SynAD effectively
> integrates all components and notably enhances safety performance. By bridging
> synthetic scenario generation and E2E AD, SynAD paves the way for more
> comprehensive and robust autonomous driving models.
