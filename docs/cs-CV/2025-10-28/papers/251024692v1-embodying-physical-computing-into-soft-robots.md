## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Softening and onboarding computers and controllers is one of the final
> frontiers in soft robotics towards their robustness and intelligence for
> everyday use. In this regard, embodying soft and physical computing presents
> exciting potential. Physical computing seeks to encode inputs into a mechanical
> computing kernel and leverage the internal interactions among this kernel's
> constituent elements to compute the output. Moreover, such input-to-output
> evolution can be re-programmable. This perspective paper proposes a framework
> for embodying physical computing into soft robots and discusses three unique
> strategies in the literature: analog oscillators, physical reservoir computing,
> and physical algorithmic computing. These embodied computers enable the soft
> robot to perform complex behaviors that would otherwise require CMOS-based
> electronics -- including coordinated locomotion with obstacle avoidance,
> payload weight and orientation classification, and programmable operation based
> on logical rules. This paper will detail the working principles of these
> embodied physical computing methods, survey the current state-of-the-art, and
> present a perspective for future development.
