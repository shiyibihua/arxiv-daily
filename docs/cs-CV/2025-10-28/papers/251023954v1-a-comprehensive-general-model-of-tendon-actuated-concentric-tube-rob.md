## 💡 一句话要点

**提出基于Cosserat杆的通用模型，用于多管多腱肌腱驱动同心管机器人。**

**关键词**: `肌腱驱动机器人` `同心管机器人` `Cosserat杆模型` `形状估计` `机器人控制`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：肌腱驱动同心管机器人缺乏完整通用机械模型。
2. 方法要点：使用Cosserat杆框架建模n个同心管，每个管由m_i个腱驱动。
3. 实验或效果：验证实验中，尖端预测误差小于机器人总长度的4%。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Tendon-actuated concentric tube mechanisms combine the advantages of
> tendon-driven continuum robots and concentric tube robots while addressing
> their respective limitations. They overcome the restricted degrees of freedom
> often seen in tendon-driven designs, and mitigate issues such as snapping
> instability associated with concentric tube robots. However, a complete and
> general mechanical model for these systems remains an open problem. In this
> work, we propose a Cosserat rod-based framework for modeling the general case
> of $n$ concentric tubes, each actuated by $m_i$ tendons, where $i = \{1,
> \ldots, n\}$. The model allows each tube to twist and elongate while enforcing
> a shared centerline for bending. We validate the proposed framework through
> experiments with two-tube and three tube assemblies under various tendon
> routing configurations, achieving tip prediction errors $<4\%$ of the robot's
> total length. We further demonstrate the model's generality by applying it to
> existing robots in the field, where maximum tip deviations remain around $5\%$
> of the total length. This model provides a foundation for accurate shape
> estimation and control of advanced tendon-actuated concentric tube robots.
