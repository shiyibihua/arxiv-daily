## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This survey comprehensively reviews the evolving field of multi-robot
> collaborative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using 3D Gaussian
> Splatting (3DGS). As an explicit scene representation, 3DGS has enabled
> unprecedented real-time, high-fidelity render- ing, ideal for robotics.
> However, its use in multi-robot systems introduces significant challenges in
> maintaining global consistency, managing communication, and fusing data from
> heterogeneous sources. We systematically categorize approaches by their
> architecture-centralized, distributed- and analyze core components like
> multi-agent consistency and alignment, communication- efficient, Gaussian
> representation, semantic distillation, fusion and pose optimization, and real-
> time scalability. In addition, a summary of critical datasets and evaluation
> metrics is provided to contextualize performance. Finally, we identify key open
> challenges and chart future research directions, including lifelong mapping,
> semantic association and mapping, multi-model for robustness, and bridging the
> Sim2Real gap.
