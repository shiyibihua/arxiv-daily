## 💡 一句话要点

**系统研究视觉语言模型的多模态上下文学习，揭示其局限与影响因素**

**关键词**: `视觉语言模型` `上下文学习` `多模态集成` `注意力机制` `指令调优` `图像描述`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：视觉语言模型在多模态上下文学习中的有效性未充分探索，存在视觉与文本信息整合不足
2. 方法要点：评估七种模型在图像描述任务上，分析提示设计、架构选择和训练策略的影响
3. 实验或效果：训练于图像-文本交错数据提升性能，但注意力分析显示模型主要依赖文本线索

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn tasks
> from demonstration examples without parameter updates. Although it has been
> extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
> remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ICL in
> VLMs, evaluating seven models spanning four architectures on three image
> captioning benchmarks. We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and
> training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the
> first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number
> of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text
> interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective
> integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In
> contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce
> reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between
> instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further
> show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage
> visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration.
> These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs
> and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal
> in-context examples.
