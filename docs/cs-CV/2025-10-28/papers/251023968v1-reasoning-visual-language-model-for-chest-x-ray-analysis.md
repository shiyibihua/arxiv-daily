## 💡 一句话要点

**提出结合思维链推理的视觉语言模型以提升胸部X光分析的透明度和准确性**

**关键词**: `胸部X光分析` `思维链推理` `视觉语言模型` `可解释AI` `强化学习` `医学图像处理`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有视觉语言模型在医学图像分析中缺乏透明推理，无法提供临床所需的逐步解释。
2. 方法要点：采用两阶段训练，包括推理风格监督微调和基于可验证奖励的强化学习。
3. 实验或效果：在分布外评估中实现竞争性分类性能，并通过专家研究提高报告效率和可信度。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong promise for medical image
> analysis, but most remain opaque, offering predictions without the transparent,
> stepwise reasoning clinicians rely on. We present a framework that brings
> chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by
> reasoning-first training paradigms, our approach is designed to learn how
> experts reason, not just what they conclude, by aligning intermediate steps
> with observable image evidence and radiology workflow. Beyond accuracy, the
> explicit reasoning traces support clinical auditability: they reveal why a
> conclusion was reached, which alternatives were considered, and where
> uncertainty remains, enabling quality assurance, error analysis, and safer
> human-AI collaboration.
>   Our model couples high-fidelity visual encoding with a two-stage training
> recipe: a reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by
> reinforcement learning (RL) that uses verifiable rewards over a list of X-ray
> abnormalities. The model outputs reasoning that mirrors radiologists systematic
> thought process, uncertainty, and differential diagnosis. In
> out-of-distribution evaluation, the approach achieves competitive multi-label
> classification while improving interpretability. In a reader study with expert
> radiologists, full reasoning traces increased confidence, supported error
> auditing, and reduced time to finalize reports. We release code and the model
> NV-Reason-CXR-3B to support community progress toward trustworthy, explainable
> AI in chest radiography and other medical imaging tasks where reasoning quality
> is as critical as prediction quality.
