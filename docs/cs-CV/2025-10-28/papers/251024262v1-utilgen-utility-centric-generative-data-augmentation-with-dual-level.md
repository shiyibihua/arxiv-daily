## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Data augmentation using generative models has emerged as a powerful paradigm
> for enhancing performance in computer vision tasks. However, most existing
> augmentation approaches primarily focus on optimizing intrinsic data attributes
> -- such as fidelity and diversity -- to generate visually high-quality
> synthetic data, while often neglecting task-specific requirements. Yet, it is
> essential for data generators to account for the needs of downstream tasks, as
> training data requirements can vary significantly across different tasks and
> network architectures. To address these limitations, we propose UtilGen, a
> novel utility-centric data augmentation framework that adaptively optimizes the
> data generation process to produce task-specific, high-utility training data
> via downstream task feedback. Specifically, we first introduce a weight
> allocation network to evaluate the task-specific utility of each synthetic
> sample. Guided by these evaluations, UtilGen iteratively refines the data
> generation process using a dual-level optimization strategy to maximize the
> synthetic data utility: (1) model-level optimization tailors the generative
> model to the downstream task, and (2) instance-level optimization adjusts
> generation policies -- such as prompt embeddings and initial noise -- at each
> generation round. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets of varying
> complexity and granularity demonstrate that UtilGen consistently achieves
> superior performance, with an average accuracy improvement of 3.87% over
> previous SOTA. Further analysis of data influence and distribution reveals that
> UtilGen produces more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data, validating
> the effectiveness of the paradigm shift from visual characteristics-centric to
> task utility-centric data augmentation.
