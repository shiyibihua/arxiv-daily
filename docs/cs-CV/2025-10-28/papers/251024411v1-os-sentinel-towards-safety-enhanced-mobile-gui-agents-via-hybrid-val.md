## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
> demonstrated human-like capabilities in operating digital environments like
> mobile platforms. While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital
> automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise
> and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety
> concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments
> presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To
> establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce
> MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety
> detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained
> annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety
> detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for
> detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge
> for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that
> OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across
> multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the
> development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.
