## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Cone-beam CT (CBCT) employs a flat-panel detector to achieve
> three-dimensional imaging with high spatial resolution. However, CBCT is
> susceptible to scatter during data acquisition, which introduces CT value bias
> and reduced tissue contrast in the reconstructed images, ultimately degrading
> diagnostic accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning-based
> scatter artifact correction method inspired by physical prior knowledge.
> Leveraging the fact that the observed point scatter probability density
> distribution exhibits rotational symmetry in the projection domain. The method
> uses Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to model the point scatter function
> and embeds it into the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) layer, which provides
> efficient nonlinear mapping capabilities for learning high-dimensional scatter
> features. By incorporating the physical characteristics of the scattered photon
> distribution together with the complex function mapping capacity of KAN, the
> model improves its ability to accurately represent scatter. The effectiveness
> of the method is validated through both synthetic and real-scan experiments.
> Experimental results show that the model can effectively correct the scatter
> artifacts in the reconstructed images and is superior to the current methods in
> terms of quantitative metrics.
