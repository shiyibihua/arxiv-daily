## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Recent advancements in legged robot locomotion have facilitated traversal
> over increasingly complex terrains. Despite this progress, many existing
> approaches rely on end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which poses
> limitations in terms of safety and interpretability, especially when
> generalizing to novel terrains. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
> VOCALoco, a modular skill-selection framework that dynamically adapts
> locomotion strategies based on perceptual input. Given a set of pre-trained
> locomotion policies, VOCALoco evaluates their viability and energy-consumption
> by predicting both the safety of execution and the anticipated cost of
> transport over a fixed planning horizon. This joint assessment enables the
> selection of policies that are both safe and energy-efficient, given the
> observed local terrain. We evaluate our approach on staircase locomotion tasks,
> demonstrating its performance in both simulated and real-world scenarios using
> a quadrupedal robot. Empirical results show that VOCALoco achieves improved
> robustness and safety during stair ascent and descent compared to a
> conventional end-to-end DRL policy
