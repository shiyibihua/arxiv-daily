## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading worldwide cause of cancer-related
> mortality, and the role of prompt precise detection is of paramount interest in
> improving patient outcomes. Conventional diagnostic methods such as colonoscopy
> and histological examination routinely exhibit subjectivity, are extremely
> time-consuming, and are susceptible to variation. Through the development of
> digital pathology, deep learning algorithms have become a powerful approach in
> enhancing diagnostic precision and efficiency. In our work, we proposed a
> convolutional neural network architecture named MSRANetV2, specially optimized
> for the classification of colorectal tissue images. The model employs a
> ResNet50V2 backbone, extended with residual attention mechanisms and
> squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks, to extract deep semantic and fine-grained
> spatial features. With channel alignment and upsampling operations, MSRANetV2
> effectively fuses multi-scale representations, thereby enhancing the robustness
> of the classification. We evaluated our model on a five-fold stratified
> cross-validation strategy on two publicly available datasets: CRC-VAL-HE-7K and
> NCT-CRC-HE-100K. The proposed model achieved remarkable average Precision,
> recall, F1-score, AUC, and test accuracy were 0.9884 plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900
> plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0145, 0.9999 plus-minus 0.00006, and
> 0.9905 plus-minus 0.0025 on the 7K dataset. On the 100K dataset, they were
> 0.9904 plus-minus 0.0091, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071,
> 0.9997 plus-minus 0.00016, and 0.9902 plus-minus 0.0006. Additionally, Grad-CAM
> visualizations were incorporated to enhance model interpretability by
> highlighting tissue areas that are medically relevant. These findings validate
> that MSRANetV2 is a reliable, interpretable, and high-performing architectural
> model for classifying CRC tissues.
