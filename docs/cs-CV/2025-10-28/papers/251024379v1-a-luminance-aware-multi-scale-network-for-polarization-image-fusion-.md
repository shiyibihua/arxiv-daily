## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Polarization image fusion combines S0 and DOLP images to reveal surface
> roughness and material properties through complementary texture features, which
> has important applications in camouflage recognition, tissue pathology
> analysis, surface defect detection and other fields. To intergrate
> coL-Splementary information from different polarized images in complex
> luminance environment, we propose a luminance-aware multi-scale network (MLSN).
> In the encoder stage, we propose a multi-scale spatial weight matrix through a
> brightness-branch , which dynamically weighted inject the luminance into the
> feature maps, solving the problem of inherent contrast difference in polarized
> images. The global-local feature fusion mechanism is designed at the bottleneck
> layer to perform windowed self-attention computation, to balance the global
> context and local details through residual linking in the feature dimension
> restructuring stage. In the decoder stage, to further improve the adaptability
> to complex lighting, we propose a Brightness-Enhancement module, establishing
> the mapping relationship between luminance distribution and texture features,
> realizing the nonlinear luminance correction of the fusion result. We also
> present MSP, an 1000 pairs of polarized images that covers 17 types of indoor
> and outdoor complex lighting scenes. MSP provides four-direction polarization
> raw maps, solving the scarcity of high-quality datasets in polarization image
> fusion. Extensive experiment on MSP, PIF and GAND datasets verify that the
> proposed MLSN outperms the state-of-the-art methods in subjective and objective
> evaluations, and the MS-SSIM and SD metircs are higher than the average values
> of other methods by 8.57%, 60.64%, 10.26%, 63.53%, 22.21%, and 54.31%,
> respectively. The source code and dataset is avalable at
