## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Neuromorphic computing systems are set to revolutionize energy-constrained
> robotics by achieving orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains, while enabling
> native temporal processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a
> promising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to
> complex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable
> nature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear
> optimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training
> on sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited
> sequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging
> its warm-up period.
>   We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient
> slope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in
> deeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning,
> we find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much
> more pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead
> to a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we
> propose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to
> bootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment
> interactions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive
> slope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an
> average return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques,
> including Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points
> under the same conditions. This work advances both the theoretical
> understanding of surrogate gradient learning in SNNs and practical training
> methodologies for neuromorphic controllers demonstrated in real-world robotic
> systems.
