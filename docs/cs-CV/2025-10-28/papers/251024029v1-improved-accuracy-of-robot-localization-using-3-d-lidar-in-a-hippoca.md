## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Boundary Vector Cells (BVCs) are a class of neurons in the brains of
> vertebrates that encode environmental boundaries at specific distances and
> allocentric directions, playing a central role in forming place fields in the
> hippocampus. Most computational BVC models are restricted to two-dimensional
> (2D) environments, making them prone to spatial ambiguities in the presence of
> horizontal symmetries in the environment. To address this limitation, we
> incorporate vertical angular sensitivity into the BVC framework, thereby
> enabling robust boundary detection in three dimensions, and leading to
> significantly more accurate spatial localization in a biologically-inspired
> robot model.
>   The proposed model processes LiDAR data to capture vertical contours, thereby
> disambiguating locations that would be indistinguishable under a purely 2D
> representation. Experimental results show that in environments with minimal
> vertical variation, the proposed 3D model matches the performance of a 2D
> baseline; yet, as 3D complexity increases, it yields substantially more
> distinct place fields and markedly reduces spatial aliasing. These findings
> show that adding a vertical dimension to BVC-based localization can
> significantly enhance navigation and mapping in real-world 3D spaces while
> retaining performance parity in simpler, near-planar scenarios.
