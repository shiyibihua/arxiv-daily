## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, yet
> early and accurate detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes.
> While numerous Deep learning (DL) models have been developed to predict DR from
> fundus images, many face challenges in maintaining robustness due to
> distributional variations caused by differences in acquisition devices,
> demographic disparities, and imaging conditions. This paper addresses this
> critical limitation by proposing a novel DR classification approach, a method
> called AdvBlur. Our method integrates adversarial blurred images into the
> dataset and employs a dual-loss function framework to address domain
> generalization. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of unseen
> distributional variations, as evidenced by comprehensive evaluations across
> multiple datasets. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to explore
> the effects of factors such as camera type, low-quality images, and dataset
> size. Furthermore, we perform ablation studies on blurred images and the loss
> function to ensure the validity of our choices. The experimental results
> demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving competitive
> performance compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization DR models on
> unseen external datasets.
