## 💡 一句话要点

**提出MC-SJD以加速自回归视觉生成，通过最大化耦合提高接受率**

**关键词**: `自回归视觉生成` `并行解码加速` `耦合理论` `无损生成` `图像生成` `视频生成`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 自回归视觉生成推理慢，每令牌生成需数千步，限制实际应用
2. 基于耦合理论，最大化迭代间草稿令牌相同概率，保持无损并行解码
3. 实验显示图像生成加速约4.2倍，视频生成加速约13.3倍，无质量损失

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> While autoregressive (AR) modeling has recently emerged as a new paradigm in
> visual generation, its practical adoption is severely constrained by the slow
> inference speed of per-token generation, which often requires thousands of
> steps to produce a single sample. To address this challenge, we propose MC-SJD,
> a training-free, lossless parallel decoding framework designed to accelerate AR
> visual generation by extending the recently introduced Speculative Jacobi
> Decoding (SJD). Although SJD shows strong potential for accelerating AR
> generation, we demonstrate that token instability across iterations
> significantly reduces the acceptance rate, a limitation that primarily arises
> from the independent sampling process used during draft token generation. To
> overcome this, we introduce MC-SJD, an information-theoretic approach based on
> coupling, which substantially accelerates standard SJD by maximizing the
> probability of sampling identical draft tokens across consecutive iterations,
> all while preserving its lossless property. Remarkably, this method requires
> only a single-line modification to the existing algorithm, yet achieves
> substantial performance gains, delivering up to a ~4.2x acceleration in image
> generation and ~13.3x acceleration in video generation compared to standard AR
> decoding, without any degradation in output quality.
