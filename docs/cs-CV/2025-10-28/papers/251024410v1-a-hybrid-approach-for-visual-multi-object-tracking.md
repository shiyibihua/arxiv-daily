## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper proposes a visual multi-object tracking method that jointly
> employs stochastic and deterministic mechanisms to ensure identifier
> consistency for unknown and time-varying target numbers under nonlinear
> dynamics. A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and
> non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to
> guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through
> proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance
> similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic
> association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix
> incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections,
> detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is
> proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their
> identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets
> and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states
> provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates.
> The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded
> videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable.
> Experimental results confirm superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
> trackers. The source-code reference implementations of both the proposed method
> and compared-trackers are provided on GitHub:
