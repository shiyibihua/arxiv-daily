## 💡 一句话要点

**提出SCOPE方法以解决多模态大模型中视觉令牌冗余问题，提升语义完整性。**

**关键词**: `多模态大语言模型` `视觉令牌剪枝` `语义完整性` `显著性与覆盖度` `高效计算`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 现有视觉令牌剪枝方法依赖注意力分数，导致语义不完整。
2. SCOPE联合建模显著性和覆盖度，迭代选择令牌以优化语义保留。
3. 在LLaVA模型上实验，SCOPE在多个基准上优于先前方法。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically process a large number of
> visual tokens, leading to considerable computational overhead, even though many
> of these tokens are redundant. Existing visual token pruning methods primarily
> focus on selecting the most salient tokens based on attention scores, resulting
> in the semantic incompleteness of the selected tokens. In this paper, we
> propose a novel visual token pruning strategy, called
> \textbf{S}aliency-\textbf{C}overage \textbf{O}riented token \textbf{P}runing
> for \textbf{E}fficient MLLMs (SCOPE), to jointly model both the saliency and
> coverage of the selected visual tokens to better preserve semantic
> completeness. Specifically, we introduce a set-coverage for a given set of
> selected tokens, computed based on the token relationships. We then define a
> token-coverage gain for each unselected token, quantifying how much additional
> coverage would be obtained by including it. By integrating the saliency score
> into the token-coverage gain, we propose our SCOPE score and iteratively select
> the token with the highest SCOPE score. We conduct extensive experiments on
> multiple vision-language understanding benchmarks using the LLaVA-1.5 and
> LLaVA-Next models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
> consistently outperforms prior approaches. Our code is available at
