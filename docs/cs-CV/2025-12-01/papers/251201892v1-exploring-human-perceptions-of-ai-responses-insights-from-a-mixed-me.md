## 💡 一句话要点

**提出混合方法研究人类对生成模型风险缓解策略的感知，揭示语言与经验影响评估。**

**关键词**: `生成模型风险缓解` `人类感知评估` `混合方法实验` `语言敏感性` `AI评估指标`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：生成模型易产生幻觉和有害内容，人类对缓解策略的感知未知。
2. 方法要点：采用混合方法实验，评估缓解策略在忠实性、公平性、去害能力和相关性等维度的响应。
3. 实验或效果：57名参与者评估显示，母语、AI工作经验和标注熟悉度显著影响评估，参与者对语言和上下文属性敏感。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> With the rapid uptake of generative AI, investigating human perceptions of generated responses has become crucial. A major challenge is their `aptitude' for hallucinating and generating harmful contents. Despite major efforts for implementing guardrails, human perceptions of these mitigation strategies are largely unknown. We conducted a mixed-method experiment for evaluating the responses of a mitigation strategy across multiple-dimensions: faithfulness, fairness, harm-removal capacity, and relevance. In a within-subject study design, 57 participants assessed the responses under two conditions: harmful response plus its mitigation and solely mitigated response. Results revealed that participants' native language, AI work experience, and annotation familiarity significantly influenced evaluations. Participants showed high sensitivity to linguistic and contextual attributes, penalizing minor grammar errors while rewarding preserved semantic contexts. This contrasts with how language is often treated in the quantitative evaluation of LLMs. We also introduced new metrics for training and evaluating mitigation strategies and insights for human-AI evaluation studies.
