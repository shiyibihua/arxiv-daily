**关键词**: `在线PCA` `隐式归一化` `高维动力学` `正则化算法` `信号噪声比` `非平稳环境`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 在线PCA算法中显式归一化丢弃参数范数信息，可能损失统计结构信息。
2. INO-PCA移除单位范数约束，引入正则化更新使范数动态演化，形成内部状态变量。
3. 理论证明高维极限下收敛于确定性过程，实验显示优于Oja算法并适应非平稳环境。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Many online learning algorithms, including classical online PCA methods, enforce explicit normalization steps that discard the evolving norm of the parameter vector. We show that this norm can in fact encode meaningful information about the underlying statistical structure of the problem, and that exploiting this information leads to improved learning behavior. Motivated by this principle, we introduce Implicitly Normalized Online PCA (INO-PCA), an online PCA algorithm that removes the unit-norm constraint and instead allows the parameter norm to evolve dynamically through a simple regularized update. We prove that in the high-dimensional limit the joint empirical distribution of the estimate and the true component converges to a deterministic measure-valued process governed by a nonlinear PDE. This analysis reveals that the parameter norm obeys a closed-form ODE coupled with the cosine similarity, forming an internal state variable that regulates learning rate, stability, and sensitivity to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The resulting dynamics uncover a three-way relationship between the norm, SNR, and optimal step size, and expose a sharp phase transition in steady-state performance. Both theoretically and experimentally, we show that INO-PCA consistently outperforms Oja's algorithm and adapts rapidly in non-stationary environments. Overall, our results demonstrate that relaxing norm constraints can be a principled and effective way to encode and exploit problem-relevant information in online learning algorithms.
