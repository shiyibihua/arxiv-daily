## 💡 一句话要点

**提出RoleMotion数据集以解决场景特定角色扮演运动合成中数据功能性和文本细粒度不足的问题**

**关键词**: `角色扮演运动合成` `细粒度文本标注` `全身运动生成` `场景特定数据集` `运动评估器`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 现有文本驱动运动数据集数据非功能化、孤立且标注粗糙，难以覆盖多样场景社交活动
2. RoleMotion包含25个场景、110个角色、500+行为、10296个高质量全身运动序列，标注27831条细粒度文本
3. 构建强评估器验证数据集质量，实验证明其在文本驱动全身生成中的高功能性和有效性

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> In this paper, we introduce RoleMotion, a large-scale human motion dataset that encompasses a wealth of role-playing and functional motion data tailored to fit various specific scenes. Existing text datasets are mainly constructed decentrally as amalgamation of assorted subsets that their data are nonfunctional and isolated to work together to cover social activities in various scenes. Also, the quality of motion data is inconsistent, and textual annotation lacks fine-grained details in these datasets. In contrast, RoleMotion is meticulously designed and collected with a particular focus on scenes and roles. The dataset features 25 classic scenes, 110 functional roles, over 500 behaviors, and 10296 high-quality human motion sequences of body and hands, annotated with 27831 fine-grained text descriptions. We build an evaluator stronger than existing counterparts, prove its reliability, and evaluate various text-to-motion methods on our dataset. Finally, we explore the interplay of motion generation of body and hands. Experimental results demonstrate the high-quality and functionality of our dataset on text-driven whole-body generation.
