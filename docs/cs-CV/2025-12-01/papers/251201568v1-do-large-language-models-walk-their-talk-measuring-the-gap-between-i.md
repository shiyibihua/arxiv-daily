## 💡 一句话要点

**提出校准差距作为标准化对齐指标，以衡量大语言模型在利他主义中的言行差异。**

**关键词**: `大语言模型对齐` `隐含关联测试` `行为利他主义` `自我报告校准` `模型一致性评估` `社会心理学方法`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：大语言模型是否表现出利他倾向，其隐含关联和自我报告能否预测实际行为。
2. 方法要点：采用多方法测试24个前沿模型，包括隐含关联测试、行为任务和自我评估量表。
3. 实验或效果：模型普遍高估自身利他行为，隐含关联不预测行为，校准差距显著影响模型一致性。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit altruistic tendencies, and critically, whether their implicit associations and self-reports predict actual altruistic behavior. Using a multi-method approach inspired by human social psychology, we tested 24 frontier LLMs across three paradigms: (1) an Implicit Association Test (IAT) measuring implicit altruism bias, (2) a forced binary choice task measuring behavioral altruism, and (3) a self-assessment scale measuring explicit altruism beliefs. Our key findings are: (1) All models show strong implicit pro-altruism bias (mean IAT = 0.87, p < .0001), confirming models "know" altruism is good. (2) Models behave more altruistically than chance (65.6% vs. 50%, p < .0001), but with substantial variation (48-85%). (3) Implicit associations do not predict behavior (r = .22, p = .29). (4) Most critically, models systematically overestimate their own altruism, claiming 77.5% altruism while acting at 65.6% (p < .0001, Cohen's d = 1.08). This "virtue signaling gap" affects 75% of models tested. Based on these findings, we recommend the Calibration Gap (the discrepancy between self-reported and behavioral values) as a standardized alignment metric. Well-calibrated models are more predictable and behaviorally consistent; only 12.5% of models achieve the ideal combination of high prosocial behavior and accurate self-knowledge.
