## 📄 摘要（原文）

> In this paper, we introduce SAM3-UNet, a simplified variant of Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3), designed to adapt SAM3 for downstream tasks at a low cost. Our SAM3-UNet consists of three components: a SAM3 image encoder, a simple adapter for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and a lightweight U-Net-style decoder. Preliminary experiments on multiple tasks, such as mirror detection and salient object detection, demonstrate that the proposed SAM3-UNet outperforms the prior SAM2-UNet and other state-of-the-art methods, while requiring less than 6 GB of GPU memory during training with a batch size of 12. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/WZH0120/SAM3-UNet.
