## 💡 一句话要点

**提出在线多机构协作教学模型，以解决软件工程高级课程师资不足问题，并融入行业参与。**

**关键词**: `在线教育` `多机构协作` `软件工程教学` `行业参与` `研究级课程`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：单个机构在软件工程高级领域缺乏足够师资或学生，难以独立开设研究级课程。
2. 方法要点：利用在线平台，联合多机构与行业专家，共同教授“AI在软件工程”课程。
3. 实验或效果：通过实验报告分享教学经验，表明该模型适用于计算机科学应用领域的研究级课程。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Covid has made online teaching and learning acceptable and students, faculty, and industry professionals are all comfortable with this mode. This comfort can be leveraged to offer an online multi-institutional research-level course in an area where individual institutions may not have the requisite faculty to teach and/or research students to enroll. If the subject is of interest to industry, online offering also allows industry experts to contribute and participate with ease. Advanced topics in Software Engineering are ideally suited for experimenting with this approach as industry, which is often looking to incorporate advances in software engineering in their practices, is likely to agree to contribute and participate. In this paper we describe an experiment in teaching a course titled "AI in Software Engineering" jointly between two institutions with active industry participation, and share our and student's experience. We believe this collaborative teaching approach can be used for offering research level courses in any applied area of computer science by institutions who are small and find it difficult to offer research level courses on their own.
