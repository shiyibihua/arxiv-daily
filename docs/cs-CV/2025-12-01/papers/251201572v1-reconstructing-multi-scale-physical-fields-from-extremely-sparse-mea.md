## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Reconstructing full fields from extremely sparse and random measurements is a longstanding ill-posed inverse problem. A powerful framework for addressing such challenges is hierarchical probabilistic modeling, where uncertainty is represented by intermediate variables and resolved through marginalization during inference. Inspired by this principle, we propose Cascaded Sensing (Cas-Sensing), a hierarchical reconstruction framework that integrates an autoencoder-diffusion cascade. First, a neural operator-based functional autoencoder reconstructs the dominant structures of the original field - including large-scale components and geometric boundaries - from arbitrary sparse inputs, serving as an intermediate variable. Then, a conditional diffusion model, trained with a mask-cascade strategy, generates fine-scale details conditioned on these large-scale structures. To further enhance fidelity, measurement consistency is enforced via the manifold constrained gradient based on Bayesian posterior sampling during the generation process. This cascaded pipeline substantially alleviates ill-posedness, delivering accurate and robust reconstructions. Experiments on both simulation and real-world datasets demonstrate that Cas-Sensing generalizes well across varying sensor configurations and geometric boundaries, making it a promising tool for practical deployment in scientific and engineering applications.
