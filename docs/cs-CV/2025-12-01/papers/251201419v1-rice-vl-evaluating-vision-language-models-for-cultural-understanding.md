## 💡 一句话要点

**提出RICE-VL基准以评估视觉语言模型在东盟国家的文化理解能力**

**关键词**: `视觉语言模型` `文化理解评估` `东盟国家` `视觉问答` `视觉定位` `多模态基准`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 视觉语言模型存在西方中心偏见，在东南亚等文化多样区域表现受限
2. RICE-VL包含超过28,000个VQA样本和1,000个视觉定位对，由文化专家标注
3. 评估显示模型在低资源国家和抽象文化领域存在显著性能差距

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in multimodal tasks but often exhibit Western-centric biases, limiting their effectiveness in culturally diverse regions like Southeast Asia (SEA). To address this, we introduce RICE-VL, a novel benchmark evaluating VLM cultural understanding across 11 ASEAN countries. RICE-VL includes over 28,000 human-curated Visual Question Answering (VQA) samples -- covering True or False, Fill-in-the-Blank, and open-ended formats -- and 1,000 image-bounding box pairs for Visual Grounding, annotated by culturally informed experts across 14 sub-ground categories. We propose SEA-LAVE, an extension of the LAVE metric, assessing textual accuracy, cultural alignment, and country identification. Evaluations of six open- and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance gaps in low-resource countries and abstract cultural domains. The Visual Grounding task tests models' ability to localize culturally significant elements in complex scenes, probing spatial and contextual accuracy. RICE-VL exposes limitations in VLMs' cultural comprehension and highlights the need for inclusive model development to better serve diverse global populations.
