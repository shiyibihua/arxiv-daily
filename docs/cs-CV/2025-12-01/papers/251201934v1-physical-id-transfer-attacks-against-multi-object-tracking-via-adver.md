## 💡 一句话要点

**提出AdvTraj攻击，通过对抗轨迹在多目标跟踪中物理转移ID以混淆系统。**

**关键词**: `多目标跟踪` `对抗攻击` `物理攻击` `轨迹生成` `ID转移` `系统鲁棒性`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：多目标跟踪中对象与ID错误关联的威胁未充分研究，现有攻击模型特定且非鲁棒。
2. 方法要点：AdvTraj攻击在检测跟踪框架中，利用对抗轨迹在线物理转移ID，不攻击对象检测模块。
3. 实验或效果：在CARLA模拟中，白盒攻击SORT成功率100%，对SOTA算法转移攻击成功率高达93%。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a critical task in computer vision, with applications ranging from surveillance systems to autonomous driving. However, threats to MOT algorithms have yet been widely studied. In particular, incorrect association between the tracked objects and their assigned IDs can lead to severe consequences, such as wrong trajectory predictions. Previous attacks against MOT either focused on hijacking the trackers of individual objects, or manipulating the tracker IDs in MOT by attacking the integrated object detection (OD) module in the digital domain, which are model-specific, non-robust, and only able to affect specific samples in offline datasets. In this paper, we present AdvTraj, the first online and physical ID-manipulation attack against tracking-by-detection MOT, in which an attacker uses adversarial trajectories to transfer its ID to a targeted object to confuse the tracking system, without attacking OD. Our simulation results in CARLA show that AdvTraj can fool ID assignments with 100% success rate in various scenarios for white-box attacks against SORT, which also have high attack transferability (up to 93% attack success rate) against state-of-the-art (SOTA) MOT algorithms due to their common design principles. We characterize the patterns of trajectories generated by AdvTraj and propose two universal adversarial maneuvers that can be performed by a human walker/driver in daily scenarios. Our work reveals under-explored weaknesses in the object association phase of SOTA MOT systems, and provides insights into enhancing the robustness of such systems.
