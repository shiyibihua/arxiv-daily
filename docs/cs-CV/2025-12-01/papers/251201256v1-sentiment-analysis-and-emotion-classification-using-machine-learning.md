## 💡 一句话要点

**提出基于机器学习的Nagamese语言情感分析与情绪分类方法，填补低资源语言研究空白。**

**关键词**: `Nagamese语言处理` `情感分析` `情绪分类` `低资源语言` `机器学习` `监督学习`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 针对Nagamese语言缺乏情感分析研究，首次进行极性（正/负/中性）和基本情绪分类。
2. 构建包含1,195词的Nagamese情感极性词典，结合其他特征，使用朴素贝叶斯和支持向量机进行监督学习。
3. 实验效果未知，但为低资源语言NLP提供了初步探索框架。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The Nagamese language, a.k.a Naga Pidgin, is an Assamese-lexified creole language developed primarily as a means of communication in trade between the people from Nagaland and people from Assam in the north-east India. Substantial amount of work in sentiment analysis has been done for resource-rich languages like English, Hindi, etc. However, no work has been done in Nagamese language. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt on sentiment analysis and emotion classification for the Nagamese Language. The aim of this work is to detect sentiments in terms of polarity (positive, negative and neutral) and basic emotions contained in textual content of Nagamese language. We build sentiment polarity lexicon of 1,195 nagamese words and use these to build features along with additional features for supervised machine learning techniques using Na"ive Bayes and Support Vector Machines.
