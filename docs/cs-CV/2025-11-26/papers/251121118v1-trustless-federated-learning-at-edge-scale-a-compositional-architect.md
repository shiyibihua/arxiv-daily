## 💡 一句话要点

**提出去中心化联邦学习架构以解决边缘设备协同中的可验证性和激励对齐问题**

**关键词**: `联邦学习` `边缘计算` `去中心化协调` `激励机制` `密码学验证` `可扩展性`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：联邦学习存在聚合器无问责、激励机制易被操纵、协调可扩展性差和治理可回溯修改
2. 方法要点：使用密码学收据证明聚合正确性、几何新颖性度量防激励博弈、并行对象所有权实现线性扩展
3. 实验或效果：未知，但方法旨在提升可扩展性和安全性

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Artificial intelligence is retracing the Internet's path from centralized provision to distributed creation. Initially, resource-intensive computation concentrates within institutions capable of training and serving large models.Eventually, as federated learning matures, billions of edge devices holding sensitive data will be able to collectively improve models without surrendering raw information, enabling both contribution and consumption at scale. This democratic vision remains unrealized due to certain compositional gaps; aggregators handle updates without accountability, economic mechanisms are lacking and even when present remain vulnerable to gaming, coordination serializes state modifications limiting scalability, and governance permits retroactive manipulation. This work addresses these gaps by leveraging cryptographic receipts to prove aggregation correctness, geometric novelty measurement to prevent incentive gaming, parallel object ownership to achieve linear scalability, and time-locked policies to check retroactive manipulation.
