## 💡 一句话要点

**提出抽象因果定义以扩展因果模型适用范围**

**关键词**: `因果推理` `抽象定义` `反事实模型` `解释理论` `逻辑公式`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有因果定义依赖因果模型，限制应用范围。
2. 方法要点：抽象关键特征，使定义适用于任何反事实模型。
3. 效果：可处理复杂逻辑公式，并扩展至解释定义。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Perhaps the most prominent current definition of (actual) causality is due to Halpern and Pearl.  It is defined using causal models (also known as structural equations models).  We abstract the definition, extracting its key features, so that it can be applied to any other model where counterfactuals are defined. By abstracting the definition, we gain a number of benefits. Not only can we apply the definition in a wider range of models, including ones that allow, for example, backtracking, but we can apply the definition to determine if A is a cause of B  even if A and B are formulas involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals (none of which can be handled by the Halpern-Pearl definition). Moreover, we can extend the ideas to getting an abstract definition of explanation that can be applied beyond causal models. Finally, we gain a deeper understanding of features of the definition  even in causal models.
