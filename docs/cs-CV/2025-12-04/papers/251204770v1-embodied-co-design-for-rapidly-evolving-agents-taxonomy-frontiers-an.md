## 💡 一句话要点

**提出具身协同设计范式，通过联合优化形态与控制以提升智能体性能**

**关键词**: `具身智能` `协同设计` `形态控制优化` `智能体演化` `机器人学` `仿真环境`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：传统方法孤立优化控制器，忽视形态与环境的协同演化，限制智能体适应性
2. 方法要点：建立分层分类法，将设计分解为大脑、形态、环境，并整合为四种协同设计框架
3. 实验或效果：综述百余项研究，涵盖模拟与真实场景的基准、数据集和应用，促进领域发展

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Brain-body co-evolution enables animals to develop complex behaviors in their environments. Inspired by this biological synergy, embodied co-design (ECD) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for creating intelligent agents-from virtual creatures to physical robots-by jointly optimizing their morphologies and controllers rather than treating control in isolation. This integrated approach facilitates richer environmental interactions and robust task performance. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of recent advances in ECD. We first formalize the concept of ECD and position it within related fields. We then introduce a hierarchical taxonomy: a lower layer that breaks down agent design into three fundamental components-controlling brain, body morphology, and task environment-and an upper layer that integrates these components into four major ECD frameworks: bi-level, single-level, generative, and open-ended. This taxonomy allows us to synthesize insights from more than one hundred recent studies. We further review notable benchmarks, datasets, and applications in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Finally, we identify significant challenges and offer insights into promising future research directions. A project associated with this survey has been created at https://github.com/Yuxing-Wang-THU/SurveyBrainBody.
