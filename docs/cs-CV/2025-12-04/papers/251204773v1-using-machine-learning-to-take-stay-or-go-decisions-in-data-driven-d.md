## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：无人机在数据驱动任务中需实时处理数据以决定是否停留执行额外行动，否则可能浪费等待时间或需折返飞行。
2. 方法要点：采用分支预测和强化学习等机器学习方法，动态适应事件概率随时间变化的场景。
3. 实验或效果：方法在多种场景下优于现有回归方法，最坏任务时间提升达4.1倍，中位任务时间接近完美知识方法仅高2.7%。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Drones are becoming indispensable in many application domains. In data-driven missions, besides sensing, the drone must process the collected data at runtime to decide whether additional action must be taken on the spot, before moving to the next point of interest. If processing does not reveal an event or situation that requires such an action, the drone has waited in vain instead of moving to the next point. If, however, the drone starts moving to the next point and it turns out that a follow-up action is needed at the previous point, it must spend time to fly-back. To take this decision, we propose different machine-learning methods based on branch prediction and reinforcement learning. We evaluate these methods for a wide range of scenarios where the probability of event occurrence changes with time. Our results show that the proposed methods consistently outperform the regression-based method proposed in the literature and can significantly improve the worst-case mission time by up to 4.1x. Also, the achieved median mission time is very close, merely up to 2.7% higher, to that of a method with perfect knowledge of the current underlying event probability at each point of interest.
