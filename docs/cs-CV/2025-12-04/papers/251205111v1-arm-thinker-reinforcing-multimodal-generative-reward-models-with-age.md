## 💡 一句话要点

**提出ARM-Thinker，通过代理工具调用增强多模态奖励模型，解决视觉幻觉与验证不足问题。**

**关键词**: `多模态奖励模型` `代理工具调用` `视觉推理` `强化学习` `基准评估`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 当前奖励模型存在幻觉、视觉基础弱、无法使用工具验证，限制复杂多模态推理可靠性。
2. ARM-Thinker自主调用外部工具（如图像裁剪、文档检索）进行可验证判断，替代静态评分。
3. 在ARMBench-VL基准上，模型在奖励建模、工具使用和多模态推理任务中显著优于基线。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Reward models are critical for aligning vision-language systems with human preferences, yet current approaches suffer from hallucination, weak visual grounding, and an inability to use tools for verification, limiting their reliability on complex multimodal reasoning tasks. We present ARM-Thinker, an A}gentic multimodal Reward Model that autonomously invokes external tools (e.g., image cropping, doc page retrieval) to ground judgments in verifiable evidence, replacing static, non-interactive reward scoring. This enables the model to verify fine-grained visual details, cross-reference multi-page evidence, and validate reasoning claims, which are capabilities absent in existing reward models. We train ARM-Thinker with multi-stage reinforcement learning, jointly optimizing tool-calling decisions and judgment accuracy. To evaluate agentic reward modeling, we introduce ARMBench-VL, comprising three benchmarks that assess fine-grained visual grounding (image-level tools), multi-page document understanding (retrieval tools), and instruction following (text-level verification). ARM-Thinker achieves +16.2% average improvement on reward modeling benchmarks, +9.6% on tool-use tasks, and outperforms baselines on multimodal math and logical reasoning benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that agentic capabilities significantly enhance both accuracy and interpretability of reward models.
