## 💡 一句话要点

**提出多语言体裁分类数据集以评估大语言模型对深层语言特征的捕获能力**

**关键词**: `大语言模型` `体裁分类` `句法分析` `隐喻检测` `语音特征` `多语言数据集`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：大语言模型是否能从原始文本中有效学习句法、语音和韵律等深层语言特征
2. 方法要点：基于古登堡计划构建多语言体裁分类数据集，并融入句法树、隐喻计数和语音指标等显式特征
3. 实验或效果：实验表明大语言模型可从原始文本或显式特征学习语言结构，但不同特征对任务贡献不均

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable potential across diverse language related tasks, yet whether they capture deeper linguistic properties, such as syntactic structure, phonetic cues, and metrical patterns from raw text remains unclear. To analysis whether LLMs can learn these features effectively and apply them to important nature language related tasks, we introduce a novel multilingual genre classification dataset derived from Project Gutenberg, a large-scale digital library offering free access to thousands of public domain literary works, comprising thousands of sentences per binary task (poetry vs. novel;drama vs. poetry;drama vs. novel) in six languages (English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese). We augment each with three explicit linguistic feature sets (syntactic tree structures, metaphor counts, and phonetic metrics) to evaluate their impact on classification performance. Experiments demonstrate that although LLM classifiers can learn latent linguistic structures either from raw text or from explicitly provided features, different features contribute unevenly across tasks, which underscores the importance of incorporating more complex linguistic signals during model training.
