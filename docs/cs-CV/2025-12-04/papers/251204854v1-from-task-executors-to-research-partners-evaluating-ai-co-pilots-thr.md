## 💡 一句话要点

**提出过程导向评估框架以解决AI在生物医学研究中作为研究协作者的有效性评估不足问题**

**关键词**: `AI评估框架` `生物医学研究` `工作流集成` `研究协作` `对话质量` `会话连续性`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有基准仅评估AI孤立组件能力，无法反映真实研究协作中的集成工作流程需求
2. 方法要点：通过快速综述识别14个基准，提出包含对话质量、工作流编排、会话连续性和研究者体验的四维评估框架
3. 实验或效果：未知具体实验效果，但框架旨在填补评估空白，提升AI作为研究协作者的实用性

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in biomedical research. However, current evaluation frameworks may inadequately assess their effectiveness as research collaborators. This rapid review examines benchmarking practices for AI systems in preclinical biomedical research. Three major databases and two preprint servers were searched from January 1, 2018 to October 31, 2025, identifying 14 benchmarks that assess AI capabilities in literature understanding, experimental design, and hypothesis generation. The results revealed that all current benchmarks assess isolated component capabilities, including data analysis quality, hypothesis validity, and experimental protocol design. However, authentic research collaboration requires integrated workflows spanning multiple sessions, with contextual memory, adaptive dialogue, and constraint propagation. This gap implies that systems excelling on component benchmarks may fail as practical research co-pilots. A process-oriented evaluation framework is proposed that addresses four critical dimensions absent from current benchmarks: dialogue quality, workflow orchestration, session continuity, and researcher experience. These dimensions are essential for evaluating AI systems as research co-pilots rather than as isolated task executors.
