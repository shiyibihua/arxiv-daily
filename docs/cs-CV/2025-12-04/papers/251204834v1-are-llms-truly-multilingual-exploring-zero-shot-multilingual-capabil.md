## 💡 一句话要点

**评估开源多语言大模型在意大利电子健康记录信息抽取中的零样本能力**

**关键词**: `多语言大模型` `零样本学习` `电子健康记录` `信息抽取` `意大利语处理` `临床文本分析`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：多语言大模型在零样本设置下处理意大利语临床文本信息抽取的泛化能力不足
2. 方法要点：利用开源多语言大模型实时抽取电子健康记录中的共病信息
3. 实验或效果：实验显示模型性能差异大，部分模型在零样本和本地部署中表现不佳，难以跨疾病泛化

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a key topic in AI and NLP, transforming sectors like healthcare, finance, education, and marketing by improving customer service, automating tasks, providing insights, improving diagnostics, and personalizing learning experiences. Information extraction from clinical records is a crucial task in digital healthcare. Although traditional NLP techniques have been used for this in the past, they often fall short due to the complexity, variability of clinical language, and high inner semantics in the free clinical text. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a powerful tool for better understanding and generating human-like text, making them highly effective in this area. In this paper, we explore the ability of open-source multilingual LLMs to understand EHRs (Electronic Health Records) in Italian and help extract information from them in real-time. Our detailed experimental campaign on comorbidity extraction from EHR reveals that some LLMs struggle in zero-shot, on-premises settings, and others show significant variation in performance, struggling to generalize across various diseases when compared to native pattern matching and manual annotations.
