**关键词**: `空间美学评估` `图像质量评估` `多维度奖励` `室内场景` `AIGC优化` `基准数据集`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有图像质量评估方法主要针对肖像和艺术图像，缺乏对室内场景空间美学的系统性评估。
2. 方法要点：引入空间美学范式，基于布局、和谐、光照和失真四个维度，构建SA-BENCH基准，并通过MLLM微调和多维融合开发SA-IQA框架。
3. 实验或效果：SA-IQA在SA-BENCH上显著优于现有方法，应用于GRPO强化学习和Best-of-N选择任务，提升生成质量。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> In recent years, Image Quality Assessment (IQA) for AI-generated images (AIGI) has advanced rapidly; however, existing methods primarily target portraits and artistic images, lacking a systematic evaluation of interior scenes. We introduce Spatial Aesthetics, a paradigm that assesses the aesthetic quality of interior images along four dimensions: layout, harmony, lighting, and distortion. We construct SA-BENCH, the first benchmark for spatial aesthetics, comprising 18,000 images and 50,000 precise annotations. Employing SA-BENCH, we systematically evaluate current IQA methodologies and develop SA-IQA, through MLLM fine-tuning and a multidimensional fusion approach, as a comprehensive reward framework for assessing spatial aesthetics. We apply SA-IQA to two downstream tasks: (1) serving as a reward signal integrated with GRPO reinforcement learning to optimize the AIGC generation pipeline, and (2) Best-of-N selection to filter high-quality images and improve generation quality. Experiments indicate that SA-IQA significantly outperforms existing methods on SA-BENCH, setting a new standard for spatial aesthetics evaluation. Code and dataset will be open-sourced to advance research and applications in this domain.
