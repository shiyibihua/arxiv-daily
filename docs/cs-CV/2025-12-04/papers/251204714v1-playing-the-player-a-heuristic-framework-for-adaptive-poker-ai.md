## 💡 一句话要点

**提出Patrick自适应扑克AI框架，通过预测锚定学习攻击人类对手的不完美性。**

**关键词**: `自适应AI` `扑克游戏` `预测锚定学习` `人类对手建模` `可解释性AI`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：挑战扑克AI追求不可利用性的传统，转向最大化利用人类对手的缺陷。
2. 方法要点：采用预测锚定学习方法，构建专门引擎以理解和攻击人类对手的心理和非理性行为。
3. 实验或效果：在64,267手牌试验中实现盈利性能，验证了自适应策略的有效性。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> For years, the discourse around poker AI has been dominated by the concept of solvers and the pursuit of unexploitable, machine-perfect play. This paper challenges that orthodoxy. It presents Patrick, an AI built on the contrary philosophy: that the path to victory lies not in being unexploitable, but in being maximally exploitative. Patrick's architecture is a purpose-built engine for understanding and attacking the flawed, psychological, and often irrational nature of human opponents. Through detailed analysis of its design, its novel prediction-anchored learning method, and its profitable performance in a 64,267-hand trial, this paper makes the case that the solved myth is a distraction from the real, far more interesting challenge: creating AI that can master the art of human imperfection.
