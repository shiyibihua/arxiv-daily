**关键词**: `地球观测模型` `合同治理训练` `服务覆盖优化` `准确性权衡` `采样策略` `语义合同设计`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：地球观测模型训练缺乏对特定区域或类别的服务覆盖保证，导致全局准确性优先但服务不均。
2. 方法要点：引入服务合同分组样本，使用观测服务协议图监控和调整合同级覆盖，通过采样权重和正则化参数实现治理。
3. 实验或效果：在AVIRIS和Sentinel-2数据集上验证，能显著减少优先覆盖误差，保持全局准确性并提升高优先级准确性。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Earth observation (EO) models are frequently trained under implicit sampling policies that optimize global accuracy but provide no explicit guarantees on who (which regions, classes, or mission-critical strata) is being served throughout training. This paper introduces a contract-governed training paradigm for EO in which training samples are grouped into service contracts -- semantically meaningful units such as (dataset, region, rare-crop indicator) -- and each contract is assigned a target service share. We instantiate this paradigm as an Observed Service Agreement Graph (OSAG), a lightweight governance layer that (i) monitors contract-level exposure (coverage) during optimization, (ii) drives empirical coverage toward target shares via contract-normalized sampling weights, and (iii) exposes explicit accuracy-governance trade-offs through two knobs: a sampling mixture coefficient alpha and a contract-regularization weight lambda_C. We provide a compact theory in a toy setting: OSAG sampling concentrates empirical coverage to targets; coverage deviations upper-bound service-risk deviations; and contract design (coarse vs. fine) modulates governance cost. Experiments on AVIRIS hyperspectral scenes (Indian Pines plus Salinas) and multispectral Sentinel-2 EuroSAT demonstrate that OSAG can substantially reduce priority coverage error while maintaining global accuracy and improving high-priority accuracy. A EuroSAT coarse-vs-fine contract ablation further evidences how semantically refined contracts can reduce the accuracy cost per unit of governance improvement.
