**关键词**: `视频生成` `人形机器人` `数据增强` `视频编辑` `合成数据`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：人形机器人AI训练缺乏大规模、多样化的视频数据，现有方法难以处理全身运动和遮挡。
2. 方法要点：基于Wan 2.2模型构建视频到视频结构，微调用于人类到人形机器人转换，并设计可扩展的数据创建管道。
3. 实验或效果：生成超过360万帧机器人化视频，用户研究显示在运动一致性和体现正确性上优于基线。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The advancement of embodied AI has unlocked significant potential for intelligent humanoid robots. However, progress in both Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and world models is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse training data. A promising solution is to "robotize" web-scale human videos, which has been proven effective for policy training. However, these solutions mainly "overlay" robot arms to egocentric videos, which cannot handle complex full-body motions and scene occlusions in third-person videos, making them unsuitable for robotizing humans. To bridge this gap, we introduce X-Humanoid, a generative video editing approach that adapts the powerful Wan 2.2 model into a video-to-video structure and finetunes it for the human-to-humanoid translation task. This finetuning requires paired human-humanoid videos, so we designed a scalable data creation pipeline, turning community assets into 17+ hours of paired synthetic videos using Unreal Engine. We then apply our trained model to 60 hours of the Ego-Exo4D videos, generating and releasing a new large-scale dataset of over 3.6 million "robotized" humanoid video frames. Quantitative analysis and user studies confirm our method's superiority over existing baselines: 69% of users rated it best for motion consistency, and 62.1% for embodiment correctness.
