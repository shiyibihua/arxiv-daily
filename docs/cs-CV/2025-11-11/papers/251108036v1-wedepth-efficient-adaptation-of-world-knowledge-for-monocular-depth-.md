**关键词**: `单目深度估计` `视觉基础模型` `特征增强` `零样本迁移` `世界知识适配`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 单目深度估计因从单张2D图像重建3D场景而具有挑战性
2. 方法利用视觉基础模型作为多级特征增强器，不修改其结构或权重
3. 在NYU-Depth v2和KITTI数据集上实现SOTA，并展示强零样本迁移能力

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Monocular depth estimation (MDE) has widely applicable but remains highly challenging due to the inherently ill-posed nature of reconstructing 3D scenes from single 2D images. Modern Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pre-trained on large-scale diverse datasets, exhibit remarkable world understanding capabilities that benefit for various vision tasks. Recent studies have demonstrated significant improvements in MDE through fine-tuning these VFMs. Inspired by these developments, we propose WEDepth, a novel approach that adapts VFMs for MDE without modi-fying their structures and pretrained weights, while effec-tively eliciting and leveraging their inherent priors. Our method employs the VFM as a multi-level feature en-hancer, systematically injecting prior knowledge at differ-ent representation levels. Experiments on NYU-Depth v2 and KITTI datasets show that WEDepth establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, achieving competi-tive results compared to both diffusion-based approaches (which require multiple forward passes) and methods pre-trained on relative depth. Furthermore, we demonstrate our method exhibits strong zero-shot transfer capability across diverse scenarios.
