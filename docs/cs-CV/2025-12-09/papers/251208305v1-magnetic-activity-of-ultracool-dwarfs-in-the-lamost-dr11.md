## 💡 一句话要点

**利用LAMOST DR11数据识别超冷矮星并研究其磁活动与自转关系**

**关键词**: `超冷矮星` `磁活动` `自转周期` `LAMOST光谱` `半监督学习` `活动-自转关系`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 研究超冷矮星磁活动生成机制，因内部全对流与类太阳星不同，理解不足且存在争议。
2. 从LAMOST DR11识别962颗超冷矮星，模拟CSST光谱，用自编码器半监督学习识别超冷矮星。
3. 以Hα线发射为代理研究磁活动，基于Kepler/K2光变曲线推导82颗自转周期，发现活动-自转关系在罗斯贝数0.12饱和。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Ultracool dwarfs consist of lowest-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Their interior is fully convective, different from that of the partly-convective Sun-like stars. Magnetic field generation process beneath the surface of ultracool dwarfs is still poorly understood and controversial. To increase samples of active ultracool dwarfs significantly, we have identified 962 ultracool dwarfs in the latest LAMOST data release, DR11. We also simulate the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) low-resolution slitless spectra by degrading the LAMOST spectra. A semi-supervised machine learning approach with an autoencoder model is built to identify ultracool dwarfs with the simulated CSST spectra, which demonstrates the capability of the CSST all-sky slitless spectroscopic survey on the detection of ultracool dwarfs. Magnetic activity of the ultracool dwarfs is investigated by using the H$α$ line emission as a proxy. The rotational periods of 82 ultracool dwarfs are derived based on the Kepler/K2 light curves. We also derive the activity-rotation relation of the ultracool dwarfs, which is saturated around a Rossby number of 0.12.
