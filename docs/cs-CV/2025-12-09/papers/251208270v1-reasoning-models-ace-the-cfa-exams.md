## 💡 一句话要点

**评估推理模型在CFA考试中的表现，发现多数模型通过所有级别**

**关键词**: `推理模型` `CFA考试` `专业评估` `大语言模型` `性能测试`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：大型语言模型在CFA考试中表现不佳，但推理模型在专业考试中的能力未知
2. 方法要点：使用模拟CFA考试数据集，包含三个级别的980道问题，评估多个先进推理模型
3. 实验或效果：多数模型通过所有级别，Gemini 3.0 Pro在Level I创纪录得分97.6%

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Previous research has reported that large language models (LLMs) demonstrate poor performance on the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exams. However, recent reasoning models have achieved strong results on graduate-level academic and professional examinations across various disciplines. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art reasoning models on a set of mock CFA exams consisting of 980 questions across three Level I exams, two Level II exams, and three Level III exams. Using the same pass/fail criteria from prior studies, we find that most models clear all three levels. The models that pass, ordered by overall performance, are Gemini 3.0 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, Claude Opus 4.1, and DeepSeek-V3.1. Specifically, Gemini 3.0 Pro achieves a record score of 97.6% on Level I. Performance is also strong on Level II, led by GPT-5 at 94.3%. On Level III, Gemini 2.5 Pro attains the highest score with 86.4% on multiple-choice questions while Gemini 3.0 Pro achieves 92.0% on constructed-response questions.
