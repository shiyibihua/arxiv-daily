**关键词**: `主题驱动图像生成` `视频衍生数据集` `身份先验` `图像编辑` `视觉语言模型` `复杂场景处理`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 当前主题驱动图像生成模型常偏离参考身份，在复杂多主题场景中表现不佳
2. 构建视频衍生大规模数据集，通过四阶段流程利用跨帧身份先验，包括视频筛选、主题挖掘配对、身份保持图像合成和验证标注
3. 实验表明使用OpenSubject训练能提升生成和编辑性能，尤其在复杂场景中

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Despite the promising progress in subject-driven image generation, current models often deviate from the reference identities and struggle in complex scenes with multiple subjects. To address this challenge, we introduce OpenSubject, a video-derived large-scale corpus with 2.5M samples and 4.35M images for subject-driven generation and manipulation. The dataset is built with a four-stage pipeline that exploits cross-frame identity priors. (i) Video Curation. We apply resolution and aesthetic filtering to obtain high-quality clips. (ii) Cross-Frame Subject Mining and Pairing. We utilize vision-language model (VLM)-based category consensus, local grounding, and diversity-aware pairing to select image pairs. (iii) Identity-Preserving Reference Image Synthesis. We introduce segmentation map-guided outpainting to synthesize the input images for subject-driven generation and box-guided inpainting to generate input images for subject-driven manipulation, together with geometry-aware augmentations and irregular boundary erosion. (iv) Verification and Captioning. We utilize a VLM to validate synthesized samples, re-synthesize failed samples based on stage (iii), and then construct short and long captions. In addition, we introduce a benchmark covering subject-driven generation and manipulation, and then evaluate identity fidelity, prompt adherence, manipulation consistency, and background consistency with a VLM judge. Extensive experiments show that training with OpenSubject improves generation and manipulation performance, particularly in complex scenes.
