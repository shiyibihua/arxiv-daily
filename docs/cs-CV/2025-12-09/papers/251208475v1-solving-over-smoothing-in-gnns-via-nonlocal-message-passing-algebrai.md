2. 方法要点：基于Post-LN引入代数平滑机制，无需额外参数，防止过平滑同时避免深度诅咒。
3. 实验或效果：在五个基准测试中验证，支持高达256层的深层网络，性能提升。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The relationship between Layer Normalization (LN) placement and the over-smoothing phenomenon remains underexplored. We identify a critical dilemma: Pre-LN architectures avoid over-smoothing but suffer from the curse of depth, while Post-LN architectures bypass the curse of depth but experience over-smoothing.
>   To resolve this, we propose a new method based on Post-LN that induces algebraic smoothing, preventing over-smoothing without the curse of depth. Empirical results across five benchmarks demonstrate that our approach supports deeper networks (up to 256 layers) and improves performance, requiring no additional parameters.
>   Key contributions:
>   Theoretical Characterization: Analysis of LN dynamics and their impact on over-smoothing and the curse of depth.
>   A Principled Solution: A parameter-efficient method that induces algebraic smoothing and avoids over-smoothing and the curse of depth.
>   Empirical Validation: Extensive experiments showing the effectiveness of the method in deeper GNNs.
