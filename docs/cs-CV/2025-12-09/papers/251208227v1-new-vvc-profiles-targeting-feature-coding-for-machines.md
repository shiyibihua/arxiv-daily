**关键词**: `特征编码` `VVC配置` `压缩效率` `编码速度` `MPEG-AI FCM` `下游任务准确性`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：传统视频编码基于人类视觉优化，不适用于神经网络中间特征的抽象、稀疏和任务特定性。
2. 方法要点：在MPEG-AI FCM标准下，分析VVC工具对特征压缩效率和下游任务准确性的影响，设计Fast、Faster、Fastest配置。
3. 实验或效果：Fast配置提升2.96% BD-Rate并减少21.8%编码时间，Fastest配置减少95.6%编码时间仅损失1.71% BD-Rate。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Modern video codecs have been extensively optimized to preserve perceptual quality, leveraging models of the human visual system. However, in split inference systems-where intermediate features from neural network are transmitted instead of pixel data-these assumptions no longer apply. Intermediate features are abstract, sparse, and task-specific, making perceptual fidelity irrelevant. In this paper, we investigate the use of Versatile Video Coding (VVC) for compressing such features under the MPEG-AI Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard. We perform a tool-level analysis to understand the impact of individual coding components on compression efficiency and downstream vision task accuracy. Based on these insights, we propose three lightweight essential VVC profiles-Fast, Faster, and Fastest. The Fast profile provides 2.96% BD-Rate gain while reducing encoding time by 21.8%. Faster achieves a 1.85% BD-Rate gain with a 51.5% speedup. Fastest reduces encoding time by 95.6% with only a 1.71% loss in BD-Rate.
