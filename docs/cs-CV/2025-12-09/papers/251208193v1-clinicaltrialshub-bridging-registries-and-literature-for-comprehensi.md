## 💡 一句话要点

**提出ClinicalTrialsHub平台，整合临床试验注册数据与文献信息以提升可访问性。**

**关键词**: `临床试验整合` `大语言模型应用` `信息提取` `结构化数据` `问答系统` `医学证据平台`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：临床试验数据分散于注册库与文献，导致信息获取不全面。
2. 方法要点：利用大语言模型自动从PubMed文章提取结构化信息，增强搜索与问答功能。
3. 实验或效果：相比仅用ClinicalTrials.gov，结构化数据访问量增加83.8%，用户研究验证实用性。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We present ClinicalTrialsHub, an interactive search-focused platform that consolidates all data from ClinicalTrials.gov and augments it by automatically extracting and structuring trial-relevant information from PubMed research articles. Our system effectively increases access to structured clinical trial data by 83.8% compared to relying on ClinicalTrials.gov alone, with potential to make access easier for patients, clinicians, researchers, and policymakers, advancing evidence-based medicine. ClinicalTrialsHub uses large language models such as GPT-5.1 and Gemini-3-Pro to enhance accessibility. The platform automatically parses full-text research articles to extract structured trial information, translates user queries into structured database searches, and provides an attributed question-answering system that generates evidence-grounded answers linked to specific source sentences. We demonstrate its utility through a user study involving clinicians, clinical researchers, and PhD students of pharmaceutical sciences and nursing, and a systematic automatic evaluation of its information extraction and question answering capabilities.
