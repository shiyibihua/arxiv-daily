**关键词**: `皮肤病变分类` `个体公平性` `分布感知重加权` `统计距离度量` `核密度估计` `医学图像分析`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：传统基于粗粒度子组的公平性方法忽视个体肤色连续变化，可能导致组内异常值偏差被掩盖。
2. 方法要点：将肤色视为连续属性，使用核密度估计建模分布，并基于统计距离度量设计重加权损失函数。
3. 实验或效果：在CNN和Transformer模型上验证，分布感知重加权优于分类方法，特定距离度量如Fidelity Similarity表现更优。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Skin color has historically been a focal point of discrimination, yet fairness research in machine learning for medical imaging often relies on coarse subgroup categories, overlooking individual-level variations. Such group-based approaches risk obscuring biases faced by outliers within subgroups. This study introduces a distribution-based framework for evaluating and mitigating individual fairness in skin lesion classification. We treat skin tone as a continuous attribute rather than a categorical label, and employ kernel density estimation (KDE) to model its distribution. We further compare twelve statistical distance metrics to quantify disparities between skin tone distributions and propose a distance-based reweighting (DRW) loss function to correct underrepresentation in minority tones. Experiments across CNN and Transformer models demonstrate: (i) the limitations of categorical reweighting in capturing individual-level disparities, and (ii) the superior performance of distribution-based reweighting, particularly with Fidelity Similarity (FS), Wasserstein Distance (WD), Hellinger Metric (HM), and Harmonic Mean Similarity (HS). These findings establish a robust methodology for advancing fairness at individual level in dermatological AI systems, and highlight broader implications for sensitive continuous attributes in medical image analysis.
