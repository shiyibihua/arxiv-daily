## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Accurate extrinsic calibration of LiDAR, RADAR, and camera sensors is essential for reliable perception in autonomous vehicles. Still, it remains challenging due to factors such as mechanical vibrations and cumulative sensor drift in dynamic environments. This paper presents RLCNet, a novel end-to-end trainable deep learning framework for the simultaneous online calibration of these multimodal sensors. Validated on real-world datasets, RLCNet is designed for practical deployment and demonstrates robust performance under diverse conditions. To support real-time operation, an online calibration framework is introduced that incorporates a weighted moving average and outlier rejection, enabling dynamic adjustment of calibration parameters with reduced prediction noise and improved resilience to drift. An ablation study highlights the significance of architectural choices, while comparisons with existing methods demonstrate the superior accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach.
