## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Efficient, accurate, and flexible relative localization is crucial in
> air-ground collaborative tasks. However, current approaches for robot relative
> localization are primarily realized in the form of distributed multi-robot SLAM
> systems with the same sensor configuration, which are tightly coupled with the
> state estimation of all robots, limiting both flexibility and accuracy. To this
> end, we fully leverage the high capacity of Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to
> integrate multiple sensors, enabling a semi-distributed cross-modal air-ground
> relative localization framework. In this work, both the UGV and the Unmanned
> Aerial Vehicle (UAV) independently perform SLAM while extracting deep
> learning-based keypoints and global descriptors, which decouples the relative
> localization from the state estimation of all agents. The UGV employs a local
> Bundle Adjustment (BA) with LiDAR, camera, and an IMU to rapidly obtain
> accurate relative pose estimates. The BA process adopts sparse keypoint
> optimization and is divided into two stages: First, optimizing camera poses
> interpolated from LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), followed by estimating the
> relative camera poses between the UGV and UAV. Additionally, we implement an
> incremental loop closure detection algorithm using deep learning-based
> descriptors to maintain and retrieve keyframes efficiently. Experimental
> results demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding performance in both
> accuracy and efficiency. Unlike traditional multi-robot SLAM approaches that
> transmit images or point clouds, our method only transmits keypoint pixels and
> their descriptors, effectively constraining the communication bandwidth under
> 0.3 Mbps. Codes and data will be publicly available on
> https://github.com/Ascbpiac/cross-model-relative-localization.git.
