## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper explores the application of vision-based system identification
> techniques in quadrotor modeling and control. Through experiments and analysis,
> we address the complexities and limitations of quadrotor modeling, particularly
> in relation to thrust and drag coefficients. Grey-box modeling is employed to
> mitigate uncertainties, and the effectiveness of an onboard vision system is
> evaluated. An LQR controller is designed based on a system identification model
> using data from the onboard vision system. The results demonstrate consistent
> performance between the models, validating the efficacy of vision based system
> identification. This study highlights the potential of vision-based techniques
> in enhancing quadrotor modeling and control, contributing to improved
> performance and operational capabilities. Our findings provide insights into
> the usability and consistency of these techniques, paving the way for future
> research in quadrotor performance enhancement, fault detection, and
> decision-making processes.
