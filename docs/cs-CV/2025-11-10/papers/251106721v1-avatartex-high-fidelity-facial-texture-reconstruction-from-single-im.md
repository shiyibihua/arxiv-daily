## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We present AvatarTex, a high-fidelity facial texture reconstruction framework
> capable of generating both stylized and photorealistic textures from a single
> image. Existing methods struggle with stylized avatars due to the lack of
> diverse multi-style datasets and challenges in maintaining geometric
> consistency in non-standard textures. To address these limitations, AvatarTex
> introduces a novel three-stage diffusion-to-GAN pipeline. Our key insight is
> that while diffusion models excel at generating diversified textures, they lack
> explicit UV constraints, whereas GANs provide a well-structured latent space
> that ensures style and topology consistency. By integrating these strengths,
> AvatarTex achieves high-quality topology-aligned texture synthesis with both
> artistic and geometric coherence. Specifically, our three-stage pipeline first
> completes missing texture regions via diffusion-based inpainting, refines style
> and structure consistency using GAN-based latent optimization, and enhances
> fine details through diffusion-based repainting. To address the need for a
> stylized texture dataset, we introduce TexHub, a high-resolution collection of
> 20,000 multi-style UV textures with precise UV-aligned layouts. By leveraging
> TexHub and our structured diffusion-to-GAN pipeline, AvatarTex establishes a
> new state-of-the-art in multi-style facial texture reconstruction. TexHub will
> be released upon publication to facilitate future research in this field.
