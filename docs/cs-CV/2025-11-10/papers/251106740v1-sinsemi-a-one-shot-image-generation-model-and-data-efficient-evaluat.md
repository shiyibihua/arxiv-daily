## 📄 摘要（原文）

> In the early stages of semiconductor equipment development, obtaining large
> quantities of raw optical images poses a significant challenge. This data
> scarcity hinder the advancement of AI-powered solutions in semiconductor
> manufacturing. To address this challenge, we introduce SinSEMI, a novel
> one-shot learning approach that generates diverse and highly realistic images
> from single optical image. SinSEMI employs a multi-scale flow-based model
> enhanced with LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) energy guidance
> during sampling, ensuring both perceptual realism and output variety. We also
> introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework tailored for this application,
> which enables a thorough assessment using just two reference images. Through
> the evaluation against multiple one-shot generation techniques, we demonstrate
> SinSEMI's superior performance in visual quality, quantitative measures, and
> downstream tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that SinSEMI-generated
> images achieve both high fidelity and meaningful diversity, making them
> suitable as training data for semiconductor AI applications.
