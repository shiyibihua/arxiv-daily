## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Visual neural decoding seeks to reconstruct or infer perceived visual stimuli
> from brain activity patterns, providing critical insights into human cognition
> and enabling transformative applications in brain-computer interfaces and
> artificial intelligence. Current approaches, however, remain constrained by the
> scarcity of high-quality stimulus-brain response pairs and the inherent
> semantic mismatch between neural representations and visual content. Inspired
> by perceptual variability and co-adaptive strategy of the biological systems,
> we propose a novel self-supervised architecture, named NeuroBridge, which
> integrates Cognitive Prior Augmentation (CPA) with Shared Semantic Projector
> (SSP) to promote effective cross-modality alignment. Specifically, CPA
> simulates perceptual variability by applying asymmetric, modality-specific
> transformations to both EEG signals and images, enhancing semantic diversity.
> Unlike previous approaches, SSP establishes a bidirectional alignment process
> through a co-adaptive strategy, which mutually aligns features from two
> modalities into a shared semantic space for effective cross-modal learning.
> NeuroBridge surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods under both
> intra-subject and inter-subject settings. In the intra-subject scenario, it
> achieves the improvements of 12.3% in top-1 accuracy and 10.2% in top-5
> accuracy, reaching 63.2% and 89.9% respectively on a 200-way zero-shot
> retrieval task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness,
> robustness, and scalability of the proposed framework for neural visual
> decoding.
