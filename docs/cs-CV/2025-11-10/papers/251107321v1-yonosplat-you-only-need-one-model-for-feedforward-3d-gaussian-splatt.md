## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Fast and flexible 3D scene reconstruction from unstructured image collections
> remains a significant challenge. We present YoNoSplat, a feedforward model that
> reconstructs high-quality 3D Gaussian Splatting representations from an
> arbitrary number of images. Our model is highly versatile, operating
> effectively with both posed and unposed, calibrated and uncalibrated inputs.
> YoNoSplat predicts local Gaussians and camera poses for each view, which are
> aggregated into a global representation using either predicted or provided
> poses. To overcome the inherent difficulty of jointly learning 3D Gaussians and
> camera parameters, we introduce a novel mixing training strategy. This approach
> mitigates the entanglement between the two tasks by initially using
> ground-truth poses to aggregate local Gaussians and gradually transitioning to
> a mix of predicted and ground-truth poses, which prevents both training
> instability and exposure bias. We further resolve the scale ambiguity problem
> by a novel pairwise camera-distance normalization scheme and by embedding
> camera intrinsics into the network. Moreover, YoNoSplat also predicts intrinsic
> parameters, making it feasible for uncalibrated inputs. YoNoSplat demonstrates
> exceptional efficiency, reconstructing a scene from 100 views (at 280x518
> resolution) in just 2.69 seconds on an NVIDIA GH200 GPU. It achieves
> state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks in both pose-free and
> pose-dependent settings. Our project page is at
