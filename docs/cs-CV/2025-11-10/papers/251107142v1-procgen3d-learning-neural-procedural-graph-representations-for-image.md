## 📄 摘要（原文）

> We introduce ProcGen3D, a new approach for 3D content creation by generating
> procedural graph abstractions of 3D objects, which can then be decoded into
> rich, complex 3D assets. Inspired by the prevalent use of procedural generators
> in production 3D applications, we propose a sequentialized, graph-based
> procedural graph representation for 3D assets. We use this to learn to
> approximate the landscape of a procedural generator for image-based 3D
> reconstruction. We employ edge-based tokenization to encode the procedural
> graphs, and train a transformer prior to predict the next token conditioned on
> an input RGB image. Crucially, to enable better alignment of our generated
> outputs to an input image, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided
> sampling into our generation process, steering output procedural graphs towards
> more image-faithful reconstructions. Our approach is applicable across a
> variety of objects that can be synthesized with procedural generators.
> Extensive experiments on cacti, trees, and bridges show that our neural
> procedural graph generation outperforms both state-of-the-art generative 3D
> methods and domain-specific modeling techniques. Furthermore, this enables
> improved generalization on real-world input images, despite training only on
> synthetic data.
