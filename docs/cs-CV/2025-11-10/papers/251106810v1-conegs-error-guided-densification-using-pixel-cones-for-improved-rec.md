## 💡 一句话要点

**提出ConeGS以改进3D高斯溅射重建，使用像素锥引导致密化减少基元数量**

**关键词**: `3D高斯溅射` `致密化方法` `图像空间引导` `基元优化` `新视角合成`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：3D高斯溅射基元分布不佳，依赖克隆致密化导致基元过多且覆盖不足
2. 方法要点：基于图像空间误差引导，沿像素锥插入新高斯，结合不透明度惩罚和预算控制
3. 实验或效果：在严格基元约束下显著提升重建质量和渲染性能，实验验证一致改进

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves state-of-the-art image quality and
> real-time performance in novel view synthesis but often suffers from a
> suboptimal spatial distribution of primitives. This issue stems from
> cloning-based densification, which propagates Gaussians along existing
> geometry, limiting exploration and requiring many primitives to adequately
> cover the scene. We present ConeGS, an image-space-informed densification
> framework that is independent of existing scene geometry state. ConeGS first
> creates a fast Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (iNGP) reconstruction as a
> geometric proxy to estimate per-pixel depth. During the subsequent 3DGS
> optimization, it identifies high-error pixels and inserts new Gaussians along
> the corresponding viewing cones at the predicted depth values, initializing
> their size according to the cone diameter. A pre-activation opacity penalty
> rapidly removes redundant Gaussians, while a primitive budgeting strategy
> controls the total number of primitives, either by a fixed budget or by
> adapting to scene complexity, ensuring high reconstruction quality. Experiments
> show that ConeGS consistently enhances reconstruction quality and rendering
> performance across Gaussian budgets, with especially strong gains under tight
> primitive constraints where efficient placement is crucial.
