## 💡 一句话要点

**提出多不确定性高斯泼溅质量评估方法、数据集和基准以解决3D重建质量评估挑战**

**关键词**: `高斯泼溅` `3D重建质量评估` `多不确定性` `主观质量评估` `数据集构建` `基准测试`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：高斯泼溅3D重建方法的质量评估缺乏统一标准，难以比较不同变体。
2. 方法要点：设计多距离主观质量评估方法，模拟人类观看行为，收集感知数据。
3. 实验或效果：构建MUGSQA数据集和两个基准，评估重建方法鲁棒性和质量指标性能。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently emerged as a promising technique for 3D
> object reconstruction, delivering high-quality rendering results with
> significantly improved reconstruction speed. As variants continue to appear,
> assessing the perceptual quality of 3D objects reconstructed with different
> GS-based methods remains an open challenge. To address this issue, we first
> propose a unified multi-distance subjective quality assessment method that
> closely mimics human viewing behavior for objects reconstructed with GS-based
> methods in actual applications, thereby better collecting perceptual
> experiences. Based on it, we also construct a novel GS quality assessment
> dataset named MUGSQA, which is constructed considering multiple uncertainties
> of the input data. These uncertainties include the quantity and resolution of
> input views, the view distance, and the accuracy of the initial point cloud.
> Moreover, we construct two benchmarks: one to evaluate the robustness of
> various GS-based reconstruction methods under multiple uncertainties, and the
> other to evaluate the performance of existing quality assessment metrics. Our
> dataset and benchmark code will be released soon.
