## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Improving the quality of hyperspectral images (HSIs), such as through
> super-resolution, is a crucial research area. However, generative modeling for
> HSIs presents several challenges. Due to their high spectral dimensionality,
> HSIs are too memory-intensive for direct input into conventional diffusion
> models. Furthermore, general generative models lack an understanding of the
> topological and geometric structures of ground objects in remote sensing
> imagery. In addition, most diffusion models optimize loss functions at the
> noise level, leading to a non-intuitive convergence behavior and suboptimal
> generation quality for complex data. To address these challenges, we propose a
> Geometric Enhanced Wavelet-based Diffusion Model (GEWDiff), a novel framework
> for reconstructing hyperspectral images at 4-times super-resolution. A
> wavelet-based encoder-decoder is introduced that efficiently compresses HSIs
> into a latent space while preserving spectral-spatial information. To avoid
> distortion during generation, we incorporate a geometry-enhanced diffusion
> process that preserves the geometric features. Furthermore, a multi-level loss
> function was designed to guide the diffusion process, promoting stable
> convergence and improved reconstruction fidelity. Our model demonstrated
> state-of-the-art results across multiple dimensions, including fidelity,
> spectral accuracy, visual realism, and clarity.
