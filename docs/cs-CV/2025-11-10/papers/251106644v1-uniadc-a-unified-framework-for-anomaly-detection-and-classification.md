## 📄 摘要（原文）

> In this paper, we introduce the task of unified anomaly detection and
> classification, which aims to simultaneously detect anomalous regions in images
> and identify their specific categories. Existing methods typically treat
> anomaly detection and classification as separate tasks, thereby neglecting
> their inherent correlation, limiting information sharing, and resulting in
> suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose UniADC, a unified anomaly
> detection and classification model that can effectively perform both tasks with
> only a few or even no anomaly images. Specifically, UniADC consists of two key
> components: a training-free controllable inpainting network and a multi-task
> discriminator. The inpainting network can synthesize anomaly images of specific
> categories by repainting normal regions guided by anomaly priors, and can also
> repaint few-shot anomaly samples to augment the available anomaly data. The
> multi-task discriminator is then trained on these synthesized samples, enabling
> precise anomaly detection and classification by aligning fine-grained image
> features with anomaly-category embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on
> three anomaly detection and classification datasets, including MVTec-FS, MTD,
> and WFDD, and the results demonstrate that UniADC consistently outperforms
> existing methods in anomaly detection, localization, and classification. The
> code is available at https://github.com/cnulab/UniADC.
