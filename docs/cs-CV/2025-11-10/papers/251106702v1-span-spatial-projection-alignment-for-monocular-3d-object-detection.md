## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Existing monocular 3D detectors typically tame the pronounced nonlinear
> regression of 3D bounding box through decoupled prediction paradigm, which
> employs multiple branches to estimate geometric center, depth, dimensions, and
> rotation angle separately. Although this decoupling strategy simplifies the
> learning process, it inherently ignores the geometric collaborative constraints
> between different attributes, resulting in the lack of geometric consistency
> prior, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we
> propose novel Spatial-Projection Alignment (SPAN) with two pivotal components:
> (i). Spatial Point Alignment enforces an explicit global spatial constraint
> between the predicted and ground-truth 3D bounding boxes, thereby rectifying
> spatial drift caused by decoupled attribute regression. (ii). 3D-2D Projection
> Alignment ensures that the projected 3D box is aligned tightly within its
> corresponding 2D detection bounding box on the image plane, mitigating
> projection misalignment overlooked in previous works. To ensure training
> stability, we further introduce a Hierarchical Task Learning strategy that
> progressively incorporates spatial-projection alignment as 3D attribute
> predictions refine, preventing early stage error propagation across attributes.
> Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can be easily
> integrated into any established monocular 3D detector and delivers significant
> performance improvements.
