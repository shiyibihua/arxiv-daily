## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Vision-based 3D occupancy prediction has made significant advancements, but
> its reliance on cameras alone struggles in challenging environments. This
> limitation has driven the adoption of sensor fusion, among which camera-radar
> fusion stands out as a promising solution due to their complementary strengths.
> However, the sparsity and noise of the radar data limits its effectiveness,
> leading to suboptimal fusion performance. In this paper, we propose REOcc, a
> novel camera-radar fusion network designed to enrich radar feature
> representations for 3D occupancy prediction. Our approach introduces two main
> components, a Radar Densifier and a Radar Amplifier, which refine radar
> features by integrating spatial and contextual information, effectively
> enhancing spatial density and quality. Extensive experiments on the
> Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that REOcc achieves significant
> performance gains over the camera-only baseline model, particularly in dynamic
> object classes. These results underscore REOcc's capability to mitigate the
> sparsity and noise of the radar data. Consequently, radar complements camera
> data more effectively, unlocking the full potential of camera-radar fusion for
> robust and reliable 3D occupancy prediction.
