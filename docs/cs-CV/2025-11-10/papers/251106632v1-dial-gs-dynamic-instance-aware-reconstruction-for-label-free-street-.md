## 💡 一句话要点

**提出DIAL-GS方法，以解决无标签街景中动态实例重建问题**

**关键词**: `街景重建` `4D高斯溅射` `动态实例感知` `自监督学习` `城市建模`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：监督方法依赖昂贵标注，自监督方法混淆动静元素且无法区分动态实例
2. 方法要点：利用外观位置不一致识别动态实例，采用实例感知4D高斯实现自适应重建
3. 实验或效果：在城市场景中超越基线，提升重建质量和实例级编辑能力

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Urban scene reconstruction is critical for autonomous driving, enabling
> structured 3D representations for data synthesis and closed-loop testing.
> Supervised approaches rely on costly human annotations and lack scalability,
> while current self-supervised methods often confuse static and dynamic elements
> and fail to distinguish individual dynamic objects, limiting fine-grained
> editing. We propose DIAL-GS, a novel dynamic instance-aware reconstruction
> method for label-free street scenes with 4D Gaussian Splatting. We first
> accurately identify dynamic instances by exploiting appearance-position
> inconsistency between warped rendering and actual observation. Guided by
> instance-level dynamic perception, we employ instance-aware 4D Gaussians as the
> unified volumetric representation, realizing dynamic-adaptive and
> instance-aware reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce a reciprocal mechanism
> through which identity and dynamics reinforce each other, enhancing both
> integrity and consistency. Experiments on urban driving scenarios show that
> DIAL-GS surpasses existing self-supervised baselines in reconstruction quality
> and instance-level editing, offering a concise yet powerful solution for urban
> scene modeling.
