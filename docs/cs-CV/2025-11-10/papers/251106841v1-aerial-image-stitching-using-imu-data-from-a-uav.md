## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely used for aerial photography and
> remote sensing applications. One of the main challenges is to stitch together
> multiple images into a single high-resolution image that covers a large area.
> Featurebased image stitching algorithms are commonly used but can suffer from
> errors and ambiguities in feature detection and matching. To address this,
> several approaches have been proposed, including using bundle adjustment
> techniques or direct image alignment. In this paper, we present a novel method
> that uses a combination of IMU data and computer vision techniques for
> stitching images captured by a UAV. Our method involves several steps such as
> estimating the displacement and rotation of the UAV between consecutive images,
> correcting for perspective distortion, and computing a homography matrix. We
> then use a standard image stitching algorithm to align and blend the images
> together. Our proposed method leverages the additional information provided by
> the IMU data, corrects for various sources of distortion, and can be easily
> integrated into existing UAV workflows. Our experiments demonstrate the
> effectiveness and robustness of our method, outperforming some of the existing
> feature-based image stitching algorithms in terms of accuracy and reliability,
> particularly in challenging scenarios such as large displacements, rotations,
> and variations in camera pose.
