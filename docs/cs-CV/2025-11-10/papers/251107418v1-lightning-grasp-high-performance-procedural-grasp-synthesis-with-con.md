## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Despite years of research, real-time diverse grasp synthesis for dexterous
> hands remains an unsolved core challenge in robotics and computer graphics. We
> present Lightning Grasp, a novel high-performance procedural grasp synthesis
> algorithm that achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over state-of-the-art
> approaches, while enabling unsupervised grasp generation for irregular,
> tool-like objects. The method avoids many limitations of prior approaches, such
> as the need for carefully tuned energy functions and sensitive initialization.
> This breakthrough is driven by a key insight: decoupling complex geometric
> computation from the search process via a simple, efficient data structure -
> the Contact Field. This abstraction collapses the problem complexity, enabling
> a procedural search at unprecedented speeds. We open-source our system to
> propel further innovation in robotic manipulation.
