## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Millimeter-wave radar offers a promising sensing modality for autonomous
> systems thanks to its robustness in adverse conditions and low cost. However,
> its utility is significantly limited by the sparsity and low resolution of
> radar point clouds, which poses challenges for tasks requiring dense and
> accurate 3D perception. Despite that recent efforts have shown great potential
> by exploring generative approaches to address this issue, they often rely on
> dense voxel representations that are inefficient and struggle to preserve
> structural detail. To fill this gap, we make the key observation that latent
> diffusion models (LDMs), though successful in other modalities, have not been
> effectively leveraged for radar-based 3D generation due to a lack of compatible
> representations and conditioning strategies. We introduce RaLD, a framework
> that bridges this gap by integrating scene-level frustum-based LiDAR
> autoencoding, order-invariant latent representations, and direct radar spectrum
> conditioning. These insights lead to a more compact and expressive generation
> process. Experiments show that RaLD produces dense and accurate 3D point clouds
> from raw radar spectrums, offering a promising solution for robust perception
> in challenging environments.
