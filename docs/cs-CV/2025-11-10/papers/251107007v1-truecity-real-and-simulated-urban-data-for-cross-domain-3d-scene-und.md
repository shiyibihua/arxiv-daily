## 📄 摘要（原文）

> 3D semantic scene understanding remains a long-standing challenge in the 3D
> computer vision community. One of the key issues pertains to limited real-world
> annotated data to facilitate generalizable models. The common practice to
> tackle this issue is to simulate new data. Although synthetic datasets offer
> scalability and perfect labels, their designer-crafted scenes fail to capture
> real-world complexity and sensor noise, resulting in a synthetic-to-real domain
> gap. Moreover, no benchmark provides synchronized real and simulated point
> clouds for segmentation-oriented domain shift analysis. We introduce TrueCity,
> the first urban semantic segmentation benchmark with cm-accurate annotated
> real-world point clouds, semantic 3D city models, and annotated simulated point
> clouds representing the same city. TrueCity proposes segmentation classes
> aligned with international 3D city modeling standards, enabling consistent
> evaluation of synthetic-to-real gap. Our extensive experiments on common
> baselines quantify domain shift and highlight strategies for exploiting
> synthetic data to enhance real-world 3D scene understanding. We are convinced
> that the TrueCity dataset will foster further development of sim-to-real gap
> quantification and enable generalizable data-driven models. The data, code, and
> 3D models are available online: https://tum-gis.github.io/TrueCity/
