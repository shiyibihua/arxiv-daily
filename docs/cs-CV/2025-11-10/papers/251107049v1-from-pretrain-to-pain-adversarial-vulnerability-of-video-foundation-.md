1. 核心问题：视频基础模型开放可访问性带来安全风险，攻击者无需任务数据即可利用漏洞
2. 方法要点：TVA利用时间表示动态，结合双向对比学习和时间一致性损失增强扰动效果
3. 实验或效果：在24个视频任务中验证TVA对下游模型和MLLMs的有效攻击

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Large-scale Video Foundation Models (VFMs) has significantly advanced various
> video-related tasks, either through task-specific models or Multi-modal Large
> Language Models (MLLMs). However, the open accessibility of VFMs also
> introduces critical security risks, as adversaries can exploit full knowledge
> of the VFMs to launch potent attacks. This paper investigates a novel and
> practical adversarial threat scenario: attacking downstream models or MLLMs
> fine-tuned from open-source VFMs, without requiring access to the victim task,
> training data, model query, and architecture. In contrast to conventional
> transfer-based attacks that rely on task-aligned surrogate models, we
> demonstrate that adversarial vulnerabilities can be exploited directly from the
> VFMs. To this end, we propose the Transferable Video Attack (TVA), a
> temporal-aware adversarial attack method that leverages the temporal
> representation dynamics of VFMs to craft effective perturbations. TVA
> integrates a bidirectional contrastive learning mechanism to maximize the
> discrepancy between the clean and adversarial features, and introduces a
> temporal consistency loss that exploits motion cues to enhance the sequential
> impact of perturbations. TVA avoids the need to train expensive surrogate
> models or access to domain-specific data, thereby offering a more practical and
> efficient attack strategy. Extensive experiments across 24 video-related tasks
> demonstrate the efficacy of TVA against downstream models and MLLMs, revealing
> a previously underexplored security vulnerability in the deployment of video
> models.
