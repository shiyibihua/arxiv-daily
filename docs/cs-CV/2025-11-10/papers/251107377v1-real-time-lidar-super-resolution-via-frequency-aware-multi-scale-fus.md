## 📄 摘要（原文）

> LiDAR super-resolution addresses the challenge of achieving high-quality 3D
> perception from cost-effective, low-resolution sensors. While recent
> transformer-based approaches like TULIP show promise, they remain limited to
> spatial-domain processing with restricted receptive fields. We introduce FLASH
> (Frequency-aware LiDAR Adaptive Super-resolution with Hierarchical fusion), a
> novel framework that overcomes these limitations through dual-domain
> processing. FLASH integrates two key innovations: (i) Frequency-Aware Window
> Attention that combines local spatial attention with global frequency-domain
> analysis via FFT, capturing both fine-grained geometry and periodic scanning
> patterns at log-linear complexity. (ii) Adaptive Multi-Scale Fusion that
> replaces conventional skip connections with learned position-specific feature
> aggregation, enhanced by CBAM attention for dynamic feature selection.
> Extensive experiments on KITTI demonstrate that FLASH achieves state-of-the-art
> performance across all evaluation metrics, surpassing even uncertainty-enhanced
> baselines that require multiple forward passes. Notably, FLASH outperforms
> TULIP with Monte Carlo Dropout while maintaining single-pass efficiency, which
> enables real-time deployment. The consistent superiority across all distance
> ranges validates that our dual-domain approach effectively handles uncertainty
> through architectural design rather than computationally expensive stochastic
> inference, making it practical for autonomous systems.
