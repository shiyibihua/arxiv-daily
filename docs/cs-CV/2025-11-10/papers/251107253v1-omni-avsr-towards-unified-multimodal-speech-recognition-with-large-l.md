## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive results in
> speech recognition across multiple modalities, including Auditory Speech
> Recognition (ASR), Visual Speech Recognition (VSR), and Audio-Visual Speech
> Recognition (AVSR). Despite this progress, current LLM-based approaches
> typically address each task independently, training separate models that raise
> computational and deployment resource use while missing potential cross-task
> synergies. They also rely on fixed-rate token compression, which restricts
> flexibility in balancing accuracy with efficiency. These limitations highlight
> the need for a unified framework that can support ASR, VSR, and AVSR while
> enabling elastic inference. To this end, we present Omni-AVSR, a unified
> audio-visual LLM that combines efficient multi-granularity training with
> parameter-efficient adaptation. Specifically, we adapt the matryoshka
> representation learning paradigm to efficiently train across multiple audio and
> visual granularities, reducing its inherent training resource use. Furthermore,
> we explore three LoRA-based strategies for adapting the backbone LLM, balancing
> shared and task-specific specialization. Experiments on LRS2 and LRS3 show that
> Omni-AVSR achieves comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art
> baselines while training a single model at substantially lower training and
> deployment resource use. The model also remains robust under acoustic noise,
> and we analyze its scaling behavior as LLM size increases, providing insights
> into the trade-off between performance and efficiency.
