## 💡 一句话要点

**提出基于视觉基础模型的源自由目标检测框架，以提升跨域泛化能力**

**关键词**: `源自由目标检测` `视觉基础模型` `特征对齐` `伪标签融合` `跨域泛化` `对比学习`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 源自由目标检测依赖源模型内部知识，导致跨域泛化受限和伪标签偏差
2. 引入三个模块：全局特征对齐、实例特征对齐和伪标签融合，利用视觉基础模型增强特征与标签质量
3. 在六个基准测试中实现最优性能，验证方法在提升迁移性和判别性方面的有效性

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) aims to adapt a source-pretrained object
> detector to a target domain without access to source data. However, existing
> SFOD methods predominantly rely on internal knowledge from the source model,
> which limits their capacity to generalize across domains and often results in
> biased pseudo-labels, thereby hindering both transferability and
> discriminability. In contrast, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pretrained on
> massive and diverse data, exhibit strong perception capabilities and broad
> generalization, yet their potential remains largely untapped in the SFOD
> setting. In this paper, we propose a novel SFOD framework that leverages VFMs
> as external knowledge sources to jointly enhance feature alignment and label
> quality. Specifically, we design three VFM-based modules: (1) Patch-weighted
> Global Feature Alignment (PGFA) distills global features from VFMs using
> patch-similarity-based weighting to enhance global feature transferability; (2)
> Prototype-based Instance Feature Alignment (PIFA) performs instance-level
> contrastive learning guided by momentum-updated VFM prototypes; and (3)
> Dual-source Enhanced Pseudo-label Fusion (DEPF) fuses predictions from
> detection VFMs and teacher models via an entropy-aware strategy to yield more
> reliable supervision. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that
> our method achieves state-of-the-art SFOD performance, validating the
> effectiveness of integrating VFMs to simultaneously improve transferability and
> discriminability.
