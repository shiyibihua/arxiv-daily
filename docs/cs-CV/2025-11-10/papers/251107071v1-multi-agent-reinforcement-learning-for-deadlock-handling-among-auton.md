## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This dissertation explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement
> learning (MARL) for handling deadlocks in intralogistics systems that rely on
> autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). AMRs enhance operational flexibility but also
> increase the risk of deadlocks, which degrade system throughput and
> reliability. Existing approaches often neglect deadlock handling in the
> planning phase and rely on rigid control rules that cannot adapt to dynamic
> operational conditions.
>   To address these shortcomings, this work develops a structured methodology
> for integrating MARL into logistics planning and operational control. It
> introduces reference models that explicitly consider deadlock-capable
> multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problems, enabling systematic evaluation of MARL
> strategies. Using grid-based environments and an external simulation software,
> the study compares traditional deadlock handling strategies with MARL-based
> solutions, focusing on PPO and IMPALA algorithms under different training and
> execution modes.
>   Findings reveal that MARL-based strategies, particularly when combined with
> centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE), outperform rule-based
> methods in complex, congested environments. In simpler environments or those
> with ample spatial freedom, rule-based methods remain competitive due to their
> lower computational demands. These results highlight that MARL provides a
> flexible and scalable solution for deadlock handling in dynamic intralogistics
> scenarios, but requires careful tailoring to the operational context.
