## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have been
> widely used for embodied symbolic planning. Yet, how to effectively use these
> models for closed-loop symbolic planning remains largely unexplored. Because
> they operate as black boxes, LLMs and VLMs can produce unpredictable or costly
> errors, making their use in high-level robotic planning especially challenging.
> In this work, we investigate how to use VLMs as closed-loop symbolic planners
> for robotic applications from a control-theoretic perspective. Concretely, we
> study how the control horizon and warm-starting impact the performance of VLM
> symbolic planners. We design and conduct controlled experiments to gain
> insights that are broadly applicable to utilizing VLMs as closed-loop symbolic
> planners, and we discuss recommendations that can help improve the performance
> of VLM symbolic planners.
