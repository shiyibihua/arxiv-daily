## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Video mirror detection has received significant research attention, yet
> existing methods suffer from limited performance and robustness. These
> approaches often over-rely on single, unreliable dynamic features, and are
> typically built on CNNs with limited receptive fields or Transformers with
> quadratic computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a
> new effective and scalable video mirror detection method, called MirrorMamba.
> Our approach leverages multiple cues to adapt to diverse conditions,
> incorporating perceived depth, correspondence and optical. We also introduce an
> innovative Mamba-based Multidirection Correspondence Extractor, which benefits
> from the global receptive field and linear complexity of the emerging Mamba
> spatial state model to effectively capture correspondence properties.
> Additionally, we design a Mamba-based layer-wise boundary enforcement decoder
> to resolve the unclear boundary caused by the blurred depth map. Notably, this
> work marks the first successful application of the Mamba-based architecture in
> the field of mirror detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
> method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches for video mirror
> detection on the benchmark datasets. Furthermore, on the most challenging and
> representative image-based mirror detection dataset, our approach achieves
> state-of-the-art performance, proving its robustness and generalizability.
