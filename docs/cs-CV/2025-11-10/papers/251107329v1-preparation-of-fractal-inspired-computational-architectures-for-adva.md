## 📄 摘要（原文）

> It introduces FractalNet, a fractal-inspired computational architectures for
> advanced large language model analysis that mainly challenges model diversity
> on a large scale in an efficient manner. The new set-up involves a
> template-driven generator, runner, and evaluation framework that, through
> systematic permutations of convolutional, normalization, activation, and
> dropout layers, can create more than 1,200 variants of neural networks. Fractal
> templates allow for structural recursion and multi-column pathways, thus,
> models become deeper and wider in a balanced way. Training utilizes PyTorch,
> Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), and gradient checkpointing and is carried out
> on the CIFAR-10 dataset for five epochs. The outcomes show that fractal-based
> architectures are capable of strong performance and are computationally
> efficient. The paper positions fractal design as a feasible and
> resource-efficient method of automated architecture exploration.
