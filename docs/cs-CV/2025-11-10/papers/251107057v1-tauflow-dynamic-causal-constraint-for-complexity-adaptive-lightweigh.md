## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Deploying lightweight medical image segmentation models on edge devices
> presents two major challenges: 1) efficiently handling the stark contrast
> between lesion boundaries and background regions, and 2) the sharp drop in
> accuracy that occurs when pursuing extremely lightweight designs (e.g., <0.5M
> parameters). To address these problems, this paper proposes TauFlow, a novel
> lightweight segmentation model. The core of TauFlow is a dynamic feature
> response strategy inspired by brain-like mechanisms. This is achieved through
> two key innovations: the Convolutional Long-Time Constant Cell (ConvLTC), which
> dynamically regulates the feature update rate to "slowly" process low-frequency
> backgrounds and "quickly" respond to high-frequency boundaries; and the STDP
> Self-Organizing Module, which significantly mitigates feature conflicts between
> the encoder and decoder, reducing the conflict rate from approximately 35%-40%
> to 8%-10%.
