## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Accurate segmentation of aortic vascular structures is critical for
> diagnosing and treating cardiovascular diseases.Traditional Transformer-based
> models have shown promise in this domain by capturing long-range dependencies
> between vascular features. However, their reliance on fixed-size rectangular
> patches often influences the integrity of complex vascular structures, leading
> to suboptimal segmentation accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose the
> adaptive Morph Patch Transformer (MPT), a novel architecture specifically
> designed for aortic vascular segmentation. Specifically, MPT introduces an
> adaptive patch partitioning strategy that dynamically generates
> morphology-aware patches aligned with complex vascular structures. This
> strategy can preserve semantic integrity of complex vascular structures within
> individual patches. Moreover, a Semantic Clustering Attention (SCA) method is
> proposed to dynamically aggregate features from various patches with similar
> semantic characteristics. This method enhances the model's capability to
> segment vessels of varying sizes, preserving the integrity of vascular
> structures. Extensive experiments on three open-source dataset(AVT, AortaSeg24
> and TBAD) demonstrate that MPT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
> improvements in segmenting intricate vascular structures.
