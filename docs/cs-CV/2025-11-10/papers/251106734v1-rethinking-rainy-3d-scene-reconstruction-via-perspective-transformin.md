## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Rain degrades the visual quality of multi-view images, which are essential
> for 3D scene reconstruction, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete
> reconstruction results. Existing datasets often overlook two critical
> characteristics of real rainy 3D scenes: the viewpoint-dependent variation in
> the appearance of rain streaks caused by their projection onto 2D images, and
> the reduction in ambient brightness resulting from cloud coverage during
> rainfall. To improve data realism, we construct a new dataset named OmniRain3D
> that incorporates perspective heterogeneity and brightness dynamicity, enabling
> more faithful simulation of rain degradation in 3D scenes. Based on this
> dataset, we propose an end-to-end reconstruction framework named REVR-GSNet
> (Rain Elimination and Visibility Recovery for 3D Gaussian Splatting).
> Specifically, REVR-GSNet integrates recursive brightness enhancement, Gaussian
> primitive optimization, and GS-guided rain elimination into a unified
> architecture through joint alternating optimization, achieving high-fidelity
> reconstruction of clean 3D scenes from rain-degraded inputs. Extensive
> experiments show the effectiveness of our dataset and method. Our dataset and
> method provide a foundation for future research on multi-view image deraining
> and rainy 3D scene reconstruction.
