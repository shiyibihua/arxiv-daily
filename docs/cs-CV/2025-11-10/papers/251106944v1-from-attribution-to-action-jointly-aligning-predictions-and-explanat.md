## 💡 一句话要点

**提出ALIGN框架以联合优化分类器和掩码器，提升模型可解释性和泛化能力**

**关键词**: `解释引导学习` `掩码生成` `领域泛化` `可解释性` `联合训练`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有解释引导学习依赖外部注释或启发式分割，监督信号质量低且难以扩展
2. 方法要点：通过迭代训练，掩码器生成任务相关软掩码，分类器优化预测准确性和对齐性
3. 实验或效果：在VLCS和Terra Incognita基准上，ALIGN在分布内外均优于基线，解释质量更高

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Explanation-guided learning (EGL) has shown promise in aligning model
> predictions with interpretable reasoning, particularly in computer vision
> tasks. However, most approaches rely on external annotations or heuristic-based
> segmentation to supervise model explanations, which can be noisy, imprecise and
> difficult to scale. In this work, we provide both empirical and theoretical
> evidence that low-quality supervision signals can degrade model performance
> rather than improve it. In response, we propose ALIGN, a novel framework that
> jointly trains a classifier and a masker in an iterative manner. The masker
> learns to produce soft, task-relevant masks that highlight informative regions,
> while the classifier is optimized for both prediction accuracy and alignment
> between its saliency maps and the learned masks. By leveraging high-quality
> masks as guidance, ALIGN improves both interpretability and generalizability,
> showing its superiority across various settings. Experiments on the two domain
> generalization benchmarks, VLCS and Terra Incognita, show that ALIGN
> consistently outperforms six strong baselines in both in-distribution and
> out-of-distribution settings. Besides, ALIGN also yields superior explanation
> quality concerning sufficiency and comprehensiveness, highlighting its
> effectiveness in producing accurate and interpretable models.
