## 💡 一句话要点

**提出MVU-Eval基准以评估多模态大模型在多视频理解中的能力**

**关键词**: `多模态大模型` `多视频理解` `基准评估` `问答对` `性能分析` `真实场景应用`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 现有基准局限于单视频理解，无法满足多视频场景需求
2. 构建包含1,824个问答对和4,959个视频的基准，评估八项核心能力
3. 实验显示当前模型在多视频理解中存在显著性能差距

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded AI
> capabilities to visual modalities, yet existing evaluation benchmarks remain
> limited to single-video understanding, overlooking the critical need for
> multi-video understanding in real-world scenarios (e.g., sports analytics and
> autonomous driving). To address this significant gap, we introduce MVU-Eval,
> the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Multi-Video Understanding for
> MLLMs. Specifically, our MVU-Eval mainly assesses eight core competencies
> through 1,824 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 4,959 videos
> from diverse domains, addressing both fundamental perception tasks and
> high-order reasoning tasks. These capabilities are rigorously aligned with
> real-world applications such as multi-sensor synthesis in autonomous systems
> and cross-angle sports analytics. Through extensive evaluation of
> state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, we reveal significant
> performance discrepancies and limitations in current MLLMs' ability to perform
> understanding across multiple videos. The benchmark will be made publicly
> available to foster future research.
