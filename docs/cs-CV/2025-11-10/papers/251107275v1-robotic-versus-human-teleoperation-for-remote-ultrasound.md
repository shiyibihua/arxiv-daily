**关键词**: `远程超声` `机器人远程操作` `人类远程操作` `性能比较` `医疗诊断`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：偏远地区缺乏超声专家，导致诊断困难与高成本。
2. 方法要点：评估机器人远程操作与人类远程操作的差异，包括设置时间和灵活性。
3. 实验或效果：人类远程操作在完成时间和位置精度上无显著差异，力应用更一致。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Diagnostic medical ultrasound is widely used, safe, and relatively low cost
> but requires a high degree of expertise to acquire and interpret the images.
> Personnel with this expertise are often not available outside of larger cities,
> leading to difficult, costly travel and long wait times for rural populations.
> To address this issue, tele-ultrasound techniques are being developed,
> including robotic teleoperation and recently human teleoperation, in which a
> novice user is remotely guided in a hand-over-hand manner through mixed reality
> to perform an ultrasound exam. These methods have not been compared, and their
> relative strengths are unknown. Human teleoperation may be more practical than
> robotics for small communities due to its lower cost and complexity, but this
> is only relevant if the performance is comparable. This paper therefore
> evaluates the differences between human and robotic teleoperation, examining
> practical aspects such as setup time and flexibility and experimentally
> comparing performance metrics such as completion time, position tracking, and
> force consistency. It is found that human teleoperation does not lead to
> statistically significant differences in completion time or position accuracy,
> with mean differences of 1.8% and 0.5%, respectively, and provides more
> consistent force application despite being substantially more practical and
> accessible.
