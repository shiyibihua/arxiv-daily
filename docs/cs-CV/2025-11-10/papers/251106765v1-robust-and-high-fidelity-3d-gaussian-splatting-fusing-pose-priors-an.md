## 📄 摘要（原文）

> 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a key rendering pipeline for
> digital asset creation due to its balance between efficiency and visual
> quality. To address the issues of unstable pose estimation and scene
> representation distortion caused by geometric texture inconsistency in large
> outdoor scenes with weak or repetitive textures, we approach the problem from
> two aspects: pose estimation and scene representation. For pose estimation, we
> leverage LiDAR-IMU Odometry to provide prior poses for cameras in large-scale
> environments. These prior pose constraints are incorporated into COLMAP's
> triangulation process, with pose optimization performed via bundle adjustment.
> Ensuring consistency between pixel data association and prior poses helps
> maintain both robustness and accuracy. For scene representation, we introduce
> normal vector constraints and effective rank regularization to enforce
> consistency in the direction and shape of Gaussian primitives. These
> constraints are jointly optimized with the existing photometric loss to enhance
> the map quality. We evaluate our approach using both public and self-collected
> datasets. In terms of pose optimization, our method requires only one-third of
> the time while maintaining accuracy and robustness across both datasets. In
> terms of scene representation, the results show that our method significantly
> outperforms conventional 3DGS pipelines. Notably, on self-collected datasets
> characterized by weak or repetitive textures, our approach demonstrates
> enhanced visualization capabilities and achieves superior overall performance.
