## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Soft Robotics presents a rich canvas for free-form and continuum devices
> capable of exerting forces in any direction and transforming between arbitrary
> configurations. However, there is no current way to tractably and directly
> exploit the design freedom due to the curse of dimensionality. Parameterisable
> sets of designs offer a pathway towards tractable, modular soft robotics that
> appropriately harness the behavioural freeform of soft structures to create
> rich embodied behaviours. In this work, we present a parametrised class of soft
> actuators, Programmable Telescopic Soft Pneumatic Actuators (PTSPAs). PTSPAs
> expand axially on inflation for deployable structures and manipulation in
> challenging confined spaces. We introduce a parametric geometry generator to
> customise actuator models from high-level inputs, and explore the new design
> space through semi-automated experimentation and systematic exploration of key
> parameters. Using it we characterise the actuators' extension/bending,
> expansion, and stiffness and reveal clear relationships between key design
> parameters and performance. Finally we demonstrate the application of the
> actuators in a deployable soft quadruped whose legs deploy to walk, enabling
> automatic adaptation to confined spaces. PTSPAs present new design paradigm for
> deployable and shape morphing structures and wherever large length changes are
> required.
