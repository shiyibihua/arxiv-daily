## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Wide-angle videos in few-shot action recognition (FSAR) effectively express
> actions within specific scenarios. However, without a global understanding of
> both subjects and background, recognizing actions in such samples remains
> challenging because of the background distractions. Receptance Weighted Key
> Value (RWKV), which learns interaction between various dimensions, shows
> promise for global modeling. While directly applying RWKV to wide-angle FSAR
> may fail to highlight subjects due to excessive background information.
> Additionally, temporal relation degraded by frames with similar backgrounds is
> difficult to reconstruct, further impacting performance. Therefore, we design
> the CompOund SegmenTation and Temporal REconstructing RWKV (Otter).
> Specifically, the Compound Segmentation Module~(CSM) is devised to segment and
> emphasize key patches in each frame, effectively highlighting subjects against
> background information. The Temporal Reconstruction Module (TRM) is
> incorporated into the temporal-enhanced prototype construction to enable
> bidirectional scanning, allowing better reconstruct temporal relation.
> Furthermore, a regular prototype is combined with the temporal-enhanced
> prototype to simultaneously enhance subject emphasis and temporal modeling,
> improving wide-angle FSAR performance. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such
> as SSv2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51 demonstrate that Otter achieves
> state-of-the-art performance. Extra evaluation on the VideoBadminton dataset
> further validates the superiority of Otter in wide-angle FSAR.
