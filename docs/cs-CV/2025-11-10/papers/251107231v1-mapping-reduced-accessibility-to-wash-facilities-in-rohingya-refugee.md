## 💡 一句话要点

**提出基于亚米级影像的半监督分割框架，量化罗兴亚难民营WASH设施可及性。**

**关键词**: `难民庇护所检测` `WASH设施可及性` `半监督分割` `亚米级遥感` `性别差异分析` `人道主义规划`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：罗兴亚难民营WASH设施可及性差，人口增长导致人均设施数下降。
2. 方法要点：使用亚米级卫星图像，开发半监督分割框架检测难民庇护所。
3. 实验或效果：庇护所检测F1分数76.4%，预测2025年每设施服务人数增至29.4。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Access to Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) services remains a major
> public health concern in refugee camps. This study introduces a remote
> sensing-driven framework to quantify WASH accessibility-specifically to water
> pumps, latrines, and bathing cubicles-in the Rohingya camps of Cox's Bazar, one
> of the world's most densely populated displacement settings. Detecting refugee
> shelters in such emergent camps presents substantial challenges, primarily due
> to their dense spatial configuration and irregular geometric patterns. Using
> sub-meter satellite images, we develop a semi-supervised segmentation framework
> that achieves an F1-score of 76.4% in detecting individual refugee shelters.
> Applying the framework across multi-year data reveals declining WASH
> accessibility, driven by rapid refugee population growth and reduced facility
> availability, rising from 25 people per facility in 2022 to 29.4 in 2025.
> Gender-disaggregated analysis further shows that women and girls experience
> reduced accessibility, in scenarios with inadequate safety-related segregation
> in WASH facilities. These findings suggest the importance of demand-responsive
> allocation strategies that can identify areas with under-served
> populations-such as women and girls-and ensure that limited infrastructure
> serves the greatest number of people in settings with fixed or shrinking
> budgets. We also discuss the value of high-resolution remote sensing and
> machine learning to detect inequality and inform equitable resource planning in
> complex humanitarian environments.
