## 📄 摘要（原文）

> This paper presents Omni-View, which extends the unified multimodal
> understanding and generation to 3D scenes based on multiview images, exploring
> the principle that "generation facilitates understanding". Consisting of
> understanding model, texture module, and geometry module, Omni-View jointly
> models scene understanding, novel view synthesis, and geometry estimation,
> enabling synergistic interaction between 3D scene understanding and generation
> tasks. By design, it leverages the spatiotemporal modeling capabilities of its
> texture module responsible for appearance synthesis, alongside the explicit
> geometric constraints provided by its dedicated geometry module, thereby
> enriching the model's holistic understanding of 3D scenes. Trained with a
> two-stage strategy, Omni-View achieves a state-of-the-art score of 55.4 on the
> VSI-Bench benchmark, outperforming existing specialized 3D understanding
> models, while simultaneously delivering strong performance in both novel view
> synthesis and 3D scene generation.
