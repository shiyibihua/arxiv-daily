**关键词**: `低剂量CT` `心血管风险评估` `可解释AI` `跨疾病推理` `肺心联合分析`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 现有方法独立处理肺和心血管任务，忽略生理交互和共享成像生物标志物
2. 框架模拟临床诊断思维，集成肺感知、知识推理和心脏表征模块
3. 在NLST队列中实现CVD筛查和死亡率预测的SOTA性能，提供可验证推理

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) inherently captures both pulmonary
> and cardiac structures, offering a unique opportunity for joint assessment of
> lung and cardiovascular health. However, most existing approaches treat these
> domains as independent tasks, overlooking their physiological interplay and
> shared imaging biomarkers. We propose an Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning
> Framework that enables interpretable cardiopulmonary risk assessment from a
> single LDCT scan. The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that
> emulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then
> reasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a
> cardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three
> synergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung
> abnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their
> cardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes
> structural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic
> cardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically
> grounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed
> framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality
> prediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines.
> Beyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning
> that aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between
> pulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms. Overall, this work
> establishes a unified and explainable paradigm for cardiovascular analysis from
> LDCT, bridging the gap between image-based prediction and mechanism-based
> medical interpretation.
