## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical requirement for reliable
> autonomous driving, where safety depends on recognizing road obstacles and
> unexpected objects beyond the training distribution. Despite extensive research
> on OOD detection in 2D images, direct transfer to 3D LiDAR point clouds has
> been proven ineffective. Current LiDAR OOD methods struggle to distinguish rare
> anomalies from common classes, leading to high false-positive rates and
> overconfident errors in safety-critical settings. We propose Relative Energy
> Learning (REL), a simple yet effective framework for OOD detection in LiDAR
> point clouds. REL leverages the energy gap between positive (in-distribution)
> and negative logits as a relative scoring function, mitigating calibration
> issues in raw energy values and improving robustness across various scenes. To
> address the absence of OOD samples during training, we propose a lightweight
> data synthesis strategy called Point Raise, which perturbs existing point
> clouds to generate auxiliary anomalies without altering the inlier semantics.
> Evaluated on SemanticKITTI and the Spotting the Unexpected (STU) benchmark, REL
> consistently outperforms existing methods by a large margin. Our results
> highlight that modeling relative energy, combined with simple synthetic
> outliers, provides a principled and scalable solution for reliable OOD
> detection in open-world autonomous driving.
