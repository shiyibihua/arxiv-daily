## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Recent advances in extreme image compression have revealed that mapping pixel
> data into highly compact latent representations can significantly improve
> coding efficiency. However, most existing methods compress images into 2-D
> latent spaces via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Swin Transformers,
> which tend to retain substantial spatial redundancy, thereby limiting overall
> compression performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Mixed
> RWKV-Transformer (MRT) architecture that encodes images into more compact 1-D
> latent representations by synergistically integrating the complementary
> strengths of linear-attention-based RWKV and self-attention-based Transformer
> models. Specifically, MRT partitions each image into fixed-size windows,
> utilizing RWKV modules to capture global dependencies across windows and
> Transformer blocks to model local redundancies within each window. The
> hierarchical attention mechanism enables more efficient and compact
> representation learning in the 1-D domain. To further enhance compression
> efficiency, we introduce a dedicated RWKV Compression Model (RCM) tailored to
> the structure characteristics of the intermediate 1-D latent features in MRT.
> Extensive experiments on standard image compression benchmarks validate the
> effectiveness of our approach. The proposed MRT framework consistently achieves
> superior reconstruction quality at bitrates below 0.02 bits per pixel (bpp).
> Quantitative results based on the DISTS metric show that MRT significantly
> outperforms the state-of-the-art 2-D architecture GLC, achieving bitrate
> savings of 43.75%, 30.59% on the Kodak and CLIC2020 test datasets,
> respectively.
