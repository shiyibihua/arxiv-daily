## 💡 一句话要点

**提出Sim4Seg框架以提升多模态多疾病医学诊断分割性能**

**关键词**: `医学图像分割` `视觉语言模型` `多模态诊断` `区域感知相似性` `测试时间缩放`

## 📋 核心要点

1. 核心问题：现有医学图像分割模型未联合处理分割与诊断任务，缺乏可解释性。
2. 方法要点：引入区域感知视觉语言相似性掩码模块，优化分割与诊断联合学习。
3. 实验或效果：在M3DS数据集上，方法在分割和诊断方面均优于基线模型。

## 📄 摘要（原文）

> Despite significant progress in pixel-level medical image analysis, existing
> medical image segmentation models rarely explore medical segmentation and
> diagnosis tasks jointly. However, it is crucial for patients that models can
> provide explainable diagnoses along with medical segmentation results. In this
> paper, we introduce a medical vision-language task named Medical Diagnosis
> Segmentation (MDS), which aims to understand clinical queries for medical
> images and generate the corresponding segmentation masks as well as diagnostic
> results. To facilitate this task, we first present the Multimodal Multi-disease
> Medical Diagnosis Segmentation (M3DS) dataset, containing diverse multimodal
> multi-disease medical images paired with their corresponding segmentation masks
> and diagnosis chain-of-thought, created via an automated diagnosis
> chain-of-thought generation pipeline. Moreover, we propose Sim4Seg, a novel
> framework that improves the performance of diagnosis segmentation by taking
> advantage of the Region-Aware Vision-Language Similarity to Mask (RVLS2M)
> module. To improve overall performance, we investigate a test-time scaling
> strategy for MDS tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
> outperforms the baselines in both segmentation and diagnosis.
